    "title": "The CHAT System: A Wearable Haptic System for Facilitating Tactile Communication",
    "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

    "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

    "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

    "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

    "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

    "content": "Humans operating in dynamic environments with limited visibility are susceptible to collisions with moving objects, occupational hazards, and/or other agents, which can result in personal injuries or fatalities. Most existing research has focused on using vibrotactile cues to address this challenge. In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach that utilizes variable impedance on an active exoskeleton to guide humans away from hazards and towards safe areas. This framework combines artificial potential fields with current impedance-based theories of exoskeleton control to provide a comprehensive navigational system that is intuitive for human operators. First, we present the mathematical framework to encode information about the locations of obstacles and the safest direction in which to move. Next, we optimize controller parameters in a series of human-subject experiments. Finally, we evaluate the framework in virtual reality on a set of randomly generated obstacle fields in environments where vision is either fully or partially occluded. Our results suggest that the exoskeleton provides significant separation from obstacles and reduced collisions compared to vision alone in conditions where visibility was limited to less than 1.3 m. Our work demonstrates that force-feedback in parallel with a human can improve overall navigation ability in low visibility conditions.",

    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Optimization of Perceived Realism of Multi-Modal Haptic Rendering Under Conflicting Sensory Cues",
    "content": "During haptic rendering, a visual display and a haptic interface are commonly utilized together to elicit multi-sensory perception of a virtual object, through a combination and integration of force-related and movement-related cues. In this study, we explore visual-haptic cue integration during multi-modal haptic rendering under conflicting cues and propose a systematic means to determine the optimal visual scaling for haptic manipulation that maximizes the perceived realism of spring rendering for a given haptic interface. We show that the parameters affecting visual-haptic congruency can be effectively optimized through a qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization to ensure a consistently high rating of perceived realism. Accordingly, the multi-modal perception of users can be successfully enhanced by solely modulating the visual feedback without altering the haptic feedback, to make virtual environments feel stiffer or more compliant, significantly extending the range of perceived stiffness levels for a haptic interface. We extend our results to a group of individuals to capture the multi-dimensional psychometric field that characterizes the cumulative effect of feedback modalities utilized during sensory cue integration under conflicts. Our results not only provide reliable estimates of just noticeable difference thresholds for stiffness with and without visual scaling but also capture all the prominent features of sensory cue integration, indicating weights that are proportional to the congruency level of manipulated visual signals. Overall, preference-based HiL optimization excels as a systematic and efficient method of studying multi-modal perception under conflicts.",

    "content": "The growing need for human-machine interfaces (HMIs) underscores the importance of sensory feedback, with electrical stimulation offering efficient interaction in various applications. While its sensory effects are extensively studied, investigations into the reaction time (RT) following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate how stimulation parameters influence RT. We examined RT and RT variability among twenty healthy participants aged 21 to 61 years. Participants underwent 16 stimulation patterns (10 repetitions per pattern) with combinations of four pulse frequencies (4, 26, 48, 70 Hz) and four pulse amplitudes (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times of sensory threshold) on four skin locations in the lower leg above peroneal nerve, tibial nerve, tibialis anterior muscle, and a lateral shank control site. RT was assessed as participants dorsiflexed their foot in response to electrical stimulation. Results revealed that both RT and its variability decreased as pulse frequency and amplitude increased, and there was an interaction effect between pulse frequency and amplitude. However, no significant difference was found in RT across stimulation locations. These findings demonstrate how stimulation parameters affect the speed and efficiency of communication between the user and the stimulator, showing promises for augmenting real-time feedback HMIs.",

    "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
    "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",

Leveraging generative adversarial networks, SatCompFLImNet effectively compensates for saturated fluorescence signals, ensuring accurate lifetime measurements across various levels of saturation. Extensively validated with simulated and real-world data, SatCompFLImNet demonstrates remarkable capability in correcting saturation artifacts, improving signal-to-noise ratios, and maintaining fidelity of lifetime measurements. By enabling reliable fluorescence lifetime measurements under a variety of saturation conditions, SatCompFLImNet paves the way for improved diagnostic tools and a deeper understanding of biological processes, making it a pivotal advancement for research and clinical diagnostics in tissue characterization and disease pathogenesis.",

    "content": "This study investigates a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, aiming to develop a non-contact, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational solution for healthcare applications. A 60 GHz mmWave radar system was employed to collect radar point cloud data from 45 participants performing STS motions. Using a deep learning-based pose estimation model and Inverse Kinematics (IK), we calculated joint angles, segmented STS motions, and extracted clinically relevant features for fall risk assessment. The extracted features were compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. While Kinect provided a reference for motion capture, we acknowledge its limitations compared to the gold-standard VICON system, which is planned for future validation. The results demonstrated that mmWave radar effectively captures general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk), though challenges remain for more fine-grained motion analysis. This study highlights the unique advantages and limitations of mmWave radar and other sensors, emphasizing the potential of integrated sensor technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Future work will expand the scope to more complex movements and incorporate high-precision motion capture systems to further validate the findings.",

    "title": "Camera Seismocardiogram Based Monitoring of Left Ventricular Ejection Time",
    "content": "Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), reflecting the duration from the onset to the end of blood ejection by the left ventricle during each heartbeat, is a critical parameter for measuring cardiac pumping efficiency. Continuous and regular monitoring of LVET is particularly crucial in assessing cardiac health, valvular function, and myocardial contractility. Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can be utilized for LVET monitoring, as the temporal distance between the aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC) in SCG signals can accurately depict LVET. This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF. We validated the effectiveness of our AO and AC detection algorithm on a self-made dataset comprising 21 participants with 9616 SCG cycles. The benchmark shows that the detection accuracy for AO and AC reached 98.16% and 97.94%, respectively, with an mean absolute error of 0.5571 ms for LVET estimation. The results demonstrate that camera-SCG has strong potential for cardiac health monitoring.",

    "title": "Biophysical Modeling of Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering",
    "content": "The increasing demand for wearables necessitates efficient energy harvesting and wireless power transfer solutions. Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering (EQS-HBP) is a promising technology for wirelessly powering on-body devices, offering enhanced received power ($P_{rx}$) with full-body coverage. Unlike EQS Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which optimizes channel capacity, EQS-HBP focuses on maximizing ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, requiring a distinct biophysical model tailored to lower termination impedance ranges where ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ peaks. This paper presents comprehensive simulations\u2014finite element method (FEM), distributed circuit modeling\u2014and in-vivo experiments to characterize the body channel as a finite impedance wire, with impedance determined by body dimensions. Contact impedance between the body and receiver, inversely related to contact area, significantly affects ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, necessitating careful design for devices with small contact areas. Furthermore, the body cross-sectional area influences voltage recovery after the point of load, with smaller cross-sections yielding reduced recovery. A lumped circuit model is developed to encapsulate these findings with circuit techniques to maximize ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, demonstrating that series resonance in a ground-floated receiver reduces input impedance by over 65x and improves ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ by more than 25\u00d7 over parallel resonance. We also propose a method to approximate optimal loading impedance for various receiver configurations and analyze the impact of inductor Q factor. We prove that neither series nor parallel resonance can mitigate the transmitter return path capacitance. These insights enable the development of a much higher on-body wireless power transfer method, advancing wearable device technology for applications in healthcare, fitness, and beyond.",

    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "title": "The speech reception threshold can be estimated using EEG electrodes in and around the ear",
    "content": "Objective. Previous studies have demonstrated that the speech reception threshold (SRT) can be estimated using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), referred to as SRTneuro. The present study assesses the feasibility of using ear-EEG, which allows for discreet measurement of neural activity from in and around the ear, to estimate the SRTneuro. Approach. Twenty young normal-hearing participants listened to audiobook excerpts at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) whilst wearing a 66-channel EEG cap and 12 ear-EEG electrodes. A linear decoder was trained on different electrode configurations to estimate the envelope of the audio excerpts from the EEG recordings. The reconstruction accuracy was determined by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the actual and the estimated envelope. A sigmoid function was then fitted to the reconstruction-accuracy-vs-SNR data points, with the midpoint of the sigmoid serving as the SRTneuro estimate for each participant. Main results. Using only in-ear electrodes, the estimated SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the behaviorally measured SRT (SRTbeh) for 6 out of 20 participants (30%). With electrodes placed both in and around the ear, the SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants (95%) and thus on par with the reference estimate obtained from full-scalp EEG. Using only electrodes in and around the ear from the right side of the head, the SRTneuro remained within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants. Significance. These findings suggest that the SRTneuro can be reliably estimated using ear-EEG, especially when combining in-ear electrodes and around-the-ear electrodes. Such an estimate can be highly useful e.g. for continuously adjusting noise-reduction algorithms in hearing aids or for logging the SRT in the user\u2019s natural environment.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Estimating the Mean: Behavioral and Neural Correlates of Summary Representations for Time Intervals",
    "content": "Our behavior is guided by the statistical regularities in the environment. Prior research on temporal context effects has highlighted the dynamic processes through which humans adapt to the environment's temporal regularities. Whereas earlier approaches have focused on the adaptation to traces of previous individual events, real-world performance often requires extracting and retaining summary statistics (e.g., the mean) of temporal distributions. To investigate these summary representations for temporal distributions and to test their sensitivity to distributional changes, we explicitly asked participants to extract the mean of different distributions of time intervals, which shared the same mean but varied in their variability specifically operationalized by the width and presentation frequency of the intervals. Our findings showed that the variability of the estimated mean increased with the distributions' variability, even though the actual mean remained constant. We further examined how such learning of temporal distributions modulates EEG signals during subsequent temporal judgments. An analysis revealed that the contingent negative variation, predictive of single-trial RTs, was correlated with how much individuals' estimates of the mean were affected by the distributions' variability. Conversely, the postinterval P2 was not modulated by the distributions but predicted participants' responses, suggesting that P2 reflects the perceived duration of an interval. Taken together, our results demonstrate not only that humans can accurately estimate the mean of a temporal distribution but also that the representation of the mean becomes more uncertain as the variability of the distribution increases, as reflected neurally in the preparation-related contingent negative variation during temporal decisions.",

    "content": "Unexpected words within a context elicit large N400 brain potentials. However, sometimes the N400 at an unexpected word is small when stereotypical agent and patient roles are reversed, such as at \u201carrested\u201d in \u201cthe cop that the thief arrested.\u201d In a study of 74 native German speakers, we demonstrate evidence that readers can avoid this so-called N400 semantic illusion if the verb is delayed with neutral information such as \u201cthat evening,\u201d but are less able to do so if the delay contains cues that could further strengthen the canonical interpretation, such as \u201cwith handcuffs.\u201d In doing so, we provide a conceptual replication of a relatively new finding and extend previous research by showing that the semantic content of the delay is important. Moreover, we demonstrate evidence that the effect of only the neutral delay increases as the experiment progresses. We propose an interpretation of these findings with reference to the Sentence Gestalt model [Rabovsky, M., Hansen, S. S., & McClelland, J. L. Modelling the N400 brain potential as change in a probabilistic representation of meaning. Nature Human Behaviour, 2, 693, 2018], which accounts for the initial illusion as resulting from uncertainty and an erroneous interpretation based on a strong semantic attractor. Two additional, novel contributions of the work are a demonstration that the illusion can be elicited in German, despite its explicit subject\u2013object case marking, and an exploration of illusion effect among individual readers.",

    "title": "Do Corollary Discharges Contain Information About the Volume of Inner Speech? An ERP Study",
    "content": "When we move our articulator organs to produce overt speech, the brain generates a corollary discharge that acts to suppress the neural and perceptual responses to our speech sounds. Recent research shows that inner speech\u2014the silent production of words in one's mind\u2014is accompanied by a corollary discharge that contains information about the timing and content of inner speech. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this corollary discharge contains information about the volume of inner speech. To investigate this, participants watched an animation that provided them with precise knowledge about when they should produce a \u201cloud\u201d or \u201cquiet\u201d inner sound. At the same time, they heard an audible sound that was either similar or dissimilar to the volume of the inner sound. We found that producing the inner sound attenuated the N1\u2014an ERP signature of auditory processing\u2014and enhanced the slow negative wave\u2014an ERP signature of anticipation and motor preparation\u2014compared with listening, regardless of whether the volume of the inner sound was similar or dissimilar to the audible sound. We also found that the volume of the inner sound did not differentially modulate the N1 or slow negative wave. We speculate that this might be because one of the functions of corollary discharge is to protect our auditory receptors from desensitization caused by audible sounds, and this might be redundant in the context of inner speech because inner speech does not produce an audible sound. We conclude that there might be a functional difference between the neural processes that underlie the production of inner and overt speech.",

    "content": "Contralateral delay activity (CDA) is a measure used to assess the amount of information being stored in visual working memory (VWM). However, it has also been suggested that CDA reflects the current focus of spatial attention, as seen in the multiple object tracking task. This study aimed to determine whether the CDA observed in the multiple object tracking task is driven by VWM storage demands, potentially stemming from the feature (cue) masking of target features. To test this, we manipulated whether participants needed to remember the tracked items under masked or unmasked conditions during the tracking phase. Our experiment revealed that CDA occurred in both conditions; the amplitude of CDA was sensitive to the tracking load only in the masked condition. These findings suggest that CDA reflects both sustained attentional activation and representational storage, with the tracking load influencing CDA only when storage in VWM is required. These results support the conclusion that CDA is primarily sensitive to VWM storage rather than the current focus of spatial attention.",

    "title": "Theta Stimulation Enhances Early Consolidation of Semantic Memory",
    "content": "This study investigates the role of theta frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in enhancing the consolidation of newly acquired semantic knowledge. Although postencoding theta oscillatory power increase has been reported to benefit episodic memory consolidation, its influence on semantic memory retention has not been examined. In this experiment, 175 participants were taught fundamental immunology concepts and were then randomly assigned to receive either theta or beta tACS, applied through midline frontal, left parietal, or bilateral parietal montages, or sham stimulation as a passive control condition. Memory for that newly acquired knowledge was assessed before and shortly after the intervention, 24 hr later, and 1 week later, to evaluate both acute and longer-lasting effects of the stimulation. Results indicated that theta tACS significantly enhanced memory consolidation compared with both sham and beta conditions, especially when applied using a parietal montage targeting the area of the left angular gyrus. The resulting improved performance was consistent across all stages of assessment, indicating a robust effect of postencoding theta stimulation on the persistence of semantic memory. This suggests that some processes and substrates of early memory consolidation are common to episodic and semantic memories. These findings hold practical implications for educational and therapeutic contexts, suggesting that theta tACS might be used to reinforce learning, in both healthy and memory-challenged individuals.",

    "content": "The current study investigates whether changes in scalp electroencephalographic activity over time reflect the effects of target detection and divided attention on memory encoding. We recorded electroencephalographic activity in 61 young adults as they memorized lists of words either under full attention (single-task) or while performing a secondary task (dual task). In both cases, colored squares appeared with each word. However, in the dual-task condition, participants also pressed a button when the colored squares were in a predefined color (target) but made no response when the squares were in a different color (distractor). Subsequent memory effects in the alpha (8\u201312 Hz) and high gamma (50\u2013100 Hz) frequency bands changed throughout the trial, and these effects differed across conditions. Before word presentation, high gamma activity was associated with encoding success in the target and single-task conditions, but not in the distractor conditions. In contrast, alpha band activity decreased following word presentation, and these decreases were greater for successfully encoded words in the target condition than in the distractor or single-task conditions. The results are consistent with the view that alpha and gamma activity reflect distinct neural processes, which both contribute to memory formation, but are differentially sensitive to task demands and momentary shifts in attention.",

    "title": "The Impact of Auditory Distraction on Visual Memory Encoding in Middle-aged and Older Adults: A High-density Electroencephalography Study",
    "content": "Multitasking is essential for facing the complexity of everyday life environments, where the simultaneous processing of multiple information streams is ubiquitous, and it often requires an increased deployment of attentional resources to manage concurrent tasks. The physiological cognitive decline associated with aging further depletes cognitive resources, making it important to investigate the impact of aging on multitasking abilities, particularly in relation to the mnestic domain. To this aim, we investigated the impact of auditory distraction on visual memory encoding in older adults using high-density electroencephalography. Fifty healthy adults aged 48\u201372 yearscompleted a dual-task paradigm, combining visual memory encoding with an auditory sustained attention task. Behavioral performance was analyzed alongside neural correlates measured through ERPs and theta synchronization during high-density electroencephalography recordings. Participants demonstrated a decline in visual memory recognition performance under the more demanding dual-task condition, but with a stable cost across age. Increasing age negatively impacted overall performance but also subjective confidence. Neurophysiological data showed larger subsequent memory effect amplitudes and increased theta synchronization during dual-tasking, suggesting greater item-specific encoding. Source localization identified the left orbitofrontal and superior temporal gyri as well as the right opercular gyrus as key regions involved in memory encoding under distraction. Increased theta power at rest correlated with worse task performance in older adults, suggesting that neural processing efficiency declines with age. These findings highlight how multitasking interferes with memory encoding in adults, with significant neural recruitment to compensate for dual-task demands.",

    "title": "Misprediction Sensitivity Is Diminished for Action-effects Resulting from Stimulus-driven Movement",
    "content": "While volitional movement is thought to be initiated based on its anticipated capacity to achieve sensory goals, stimulus-driven movement may be generated with less regard for its specific effects. Sensorimotor processes that make use of action-effect predictions may therefore differ between these forms of movement, including sensory attenuation and the detection of mispredicted motor effects. In this study, we explored sensory attenuation by comparing the evoked response of externally-generated tones with those produced by participants (n = 61), both according to their own timing (i.e., volitionally) and in response to simple visual cues (i.e., stimulus-driven). The influence of stimulus identity prediction (i.e., the predictability of tone frequency) on N1 amplitudes was not found to differ between self- and externally-generated stimuli, or on the basis of volitional control. Reduced P2 amplitudes were observed in response to self-generated tones, which may suggest that these were subject to higher levels of attentional control, including processes involved in the termination of attention. To explore misprediction sensitivity, we compared the influence of stimulus identity prediction on N2b component amplitudes. A significant interaction was found to reflect heightened sensitivity to mispredicted outcomes of volitional action, compared with those of stimulus-driven movement. In light of recent evidence that attentional suppression may attenuate the primary cortical response to outcomes of stimulus-driven movement, we propose that this mechanism might also serve to diminish misprediction sensitivity. As such, these effects may represent important features of sensorimotor processing that assist in differentiating stimuli on the basis of self-generation and intentionality.",

    "content": "Psychological stress impairs cognition, forcing attention toward stressor-related information. However, stress may reallocate limited cognitive resources in adaptive ways. How stress modulates the attentional control remains unclear. In this study, the stress-related changes in both target processing and distractor interference were investigated in Experiment 1, where an additional singleton task was employed with a stress group and a control group. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with both stress responses and attentional control. The role of the left DLPFC in regulating attention control under stress was investigated using repetitive TMS in Experiment 2, which included control-vertex, stress-vertex, and stress-DLPFC groups. Electroencephalography was recorded. The results showed that (1) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited increased RT attentional capture effect and greater distractor-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, indicating increased distractor interference under stress; (2) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited a greater target-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, suggesting enhanced target processing under stress; and (3) compared with the stress-vertex group, the stress-DLPFC group exhibited greater target-elicited N2pc effect, but a similar distractor-elicited N2pc effect, suggesting that left-DLPFC stimulation improved target processing but exerted no influence on distractor processing. In addition, faster RTs, along with a reduced RT attentional capture effect, were found for the stress-DLPFC group, implying that the target processing following left-DLPFC stimulation might be less affected by the distractor due to the heightened target processing. The left DLPFC may play a crucial role in modulating attentional control under stress.",

    "title": "A Role of Pupil-linked Arousal, Cingulo-insular Cortex, and Intralaminar Thalamus for Auditory Near-threshold Perception",
    "content": "The perception of near-threshold tones varies strongly across trials, likely because of fluctuations in sustained attention or arousal. We used parallel fMRI and pupillometry to study the role of attention networks for the detection of near-threshold tones in three phases: (1) passive listening, (2) active detection of salient tones, and (3) active detection of near-threshold tones. Results confirmed previous findings from magnetoencephalography that auditory cortex activity and pupil-dilation responses for near-threshold tones were only observed when task-relevant, stronger for hit trials, but also present for miss trials. We then sought which attention-related areas show a similar response pattern, and found it in insular cortex, anterior midcingulate cortex, and inferior precentral sulcus. Moreover, activity in the insula was already stronger for hit than miss trials in the prestimulus interval. Activity for hit trials was also observed in a number of subcortical nuclei, including thalamus, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, and the colliculi. Like insula, activity in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus additionally showed activity for miss trials and stronger activity for hit trials in the baseline. Finally, BOLD activity correlated to spontaneous pupil fluctuations was evaluated and revealed biphasic activation and deactivation in a widespread cortical network, with a maximum 3 sec and minimum 7 sec after pupil dilation. The cortical networks included insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, retro-splenial, and sensory cortex. Overall, these data identify the cingulo-insular network and the intralaminar thalamic nuclei as potential sources of fluctuations in auditory cortex activity in the context of near-threshold tone detection.",

    "title": "Synchrotron XRF imaging reveals manganese accumulation in the Golgi and post-synapses of neurons and enhanced uptake in astrocytes",
    "content": "Manganese is an essential trace metal for humans, but excessive exposure can cause neurotoxicity, including parkinsonian syndromes, cognitive deficits, and has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Globally, tens of millions of people are exposed to elevated manganese levels through drinking water, exceeding the WHO recommended guideline. Despite its public health significance, the cellular and subcellular mechanisms underlying manganese neurotoxicity remain poorly defined, particularly its distribution across brain cell types and its specific intracellular targets. In this study, we investigated manganese accumulation in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and astrocytes. Using a correlative imaging approach that combined cryo-fluorescence light microscopy with synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging, we mapped and quantified manganese at subcellular resolution. Our analysis revealed that manganese preferentially accumulates in the Golgi apparatus of both neurons and astrocytes. In neurons, manganese was also detected in dendrites at the postsynaptic density, suggesting a role in synaptic vulnerability. Quantitative elemental analysis showed that astrocytes accumulated 3 times more manganese than neurons. Furthermore, when neurons were co-cultured with astrocytes, their manganese uptake was significantly reduced, indicating a possible protective or buffering role of astrocytes. These findings identify key cellular and subcellular targets of manganese and highlight the Golgi apparatus as a major regulator of manganese neurotoxicity. This work provides a foundation for understanding cell type-specific responses to manganese exposure and may inform the development of targeted neuroprotection strategies.",

    "content": "Background and purposeDiabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common concomitant disease of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events (post-MACEs) may diminish the surgical benefits of patients with ICH. However, evidence regarding the impact of DM on post-MACEs remains limited.MethodsThis was a multicenter cohort study that enrolled ICH patients presenting to eight neurosurgery departments between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. Patients were categorized into DM group and no diabetes mellitus (nDM) group, based on the presence or absence of DM. Intergroup comparisons were performed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact of DM on post-MACEs and 30-days mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. A stratified analysis was also conducted based on the type of post-MACEs.ResultsA total of 688 ICH patients were included in the study, of whom 576 (83.7%) were classified into the nDM group and 112 (16.3%) into the DM group. Compared with the nDM group, the DM group exhibited significantly higher incidences of overall post-MACEs (28.6%), ischemic post-MACEs (14.3%), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (23.2%), and 30-days mortality (9.8%). After adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, alcohol, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, antiplatelet therapy, and intraventricular hemorrhage, DM remained a significant predictor of overall post-MACEs (OR: 1.790, 95%CI: 1.072\u20132.990, p\u202f=\u202f0.026), ischemic post-MACEs (OR: 2.139, 95%CI: 1.090\u20134.197, p\u202f=\u202f0.027), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (OR: 1.778, 95%CI: 1.015\u20133.114, p\u202f=\u202f0.044), and 30-days mortality (OR: 3.593, 95%CI: 1.536\u20138.406, p\u202f=\u202f0.003).ConclusionIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that DM serves as a significant risk factor for ischemic post-MACEs, hemorrhagic post-MACEs, and 30-days mortality among patients with ICH.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is closely linked to astrocytes. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of data from a wide range of literature in this field to enhance the in-depth understanding of this area.MethodsPublications were retrieved from the 2000\u20132025 Web of Science Core Collection on January 21, 2025. Bibliometrix-package of R, VOSviewer and CiteSpace were used to visualize the research focus and trends.ResultsThe number of citations for the top 100 articles ranged from 208 to 602 citations, with a median of 293 and an average of 331.67 citations per article. The author with the most contributions to this collection was Holtzman David M, who authored 7 papers. Most articles originated in the United States (n\u202f=\u202f69), while Washington University was the institution with the most cited manuscripts (n\u202f=\u202f40). The Journal of Neuroscience contributed the most publications (n\u202f=\u202f15), followed by Nature Neuroscience (n\u202f=\u202f7). Co-occurrence of keywords analysis unveiled earlier studies focusing on \u201cmessenger RNA,\u201d and \u201cIFN-\u03b3,\u201d recent studies concentrated on \u201cmechanisms,\u201d and \u201cactivation.\u201d Moreover, keywords burst analysis indicated that the most recent prominent keywords were \u201cA\u03b2,\u201d \u201cactivation\u201d and \u201cassociation\u201d since 2016.ConclusionThis is the first bibliometric analysis of the top 100 cited research on astrocytes and AD from 2000 to 2025, underscoring that the United States is a prominent leader in this field. Our analysis highlighted the growing interest in the pathogenesis of astrocytes in AD. Future studies on the mechanisms underlying astrocytes in AD will facilitate further research on new therapeutic approaches.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.07009v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs, taking into account their biological or existential significance for an intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of the model is also provided.",

    "content": "Territorial animals must moderate their social aggression and avoidance behaviors in a manner that maximizes their access to resources and fitness. The ventrolateral division of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMHvl) has been shown to control both social aggression and avoidance in mice, and emerging data show that neural plasticity within VMHvl can drive the experience-dependent adaptation of these behaviors. Here, we investigated the contribution of immediate early gene (IEG) function in supporting this plasticity. In initial experiments, we found that downregulation of the IEG cFos in VMHvl did not significantly moderate the long-term increase in social avoidance seen following an experience of social defeat. However, local knockout of the IEG master regulator Serum Response Factor (SRF, Srf) was able to blunt the impact of social defeat on social avoidance and prevented the effect of social defeat on local optogenetic-evoked social avoidance behavior, demonstrating a critical role for subcortical IEG activity in social defeat-induced behavioral plasticity. To test whether NMDA receptor dependent plasticity might be involved in this effect, we locally infused the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 into VMHvl and assessed the impact of social defeat. Unexpectedly, MK-801 treatment led to an increase in social defeat-induced avoidance, pointing to the existence of opposing IEG and NMDA receptor-dependent adaptive mechanisms in medial hypothalamus. These findings suggest that multiple neural plasticity mechanisms are likely to be at play in the hypothalamic nuclei supporting innate behavior adaptation and show how IEG blockade can be used as a genetic tool to systematically map neural plasticity in the brain.",

Most studies investigating laminar origins of alpha oscillations have been conducted on animals using invasive intracranial recordings. To relate these findings to human alpha generation, non-invasive techniques need to be developed. Layer functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high field (UHF, 7T) allows for the interrogation of brain responses across cortical depths and combined with simultaneous EEG, provides the opportunity to gain new insight into human alpha generation mechanisms. This work establishes a framework to study the generating mechanisms of electrophysiological signals non-invasively in humans using simultaneous EEG layer-fMRI. Data were acquired on 10 participants during an eyes closed/eyes open paradigm. We showed that in 9/10 participants the quality of EEG and Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI data were sufficient to observe a significant negative correlation between EEG alpha power and the BOLD signal in visual cortex grey matter to the eyes open/eyes closed task. \"Deveining\" was performed to overcome the increase in BOLD signal toward the pial surface due to draining veins, and the effects of each of the steps in the deveining analysis on the cortical depth profiles of the negative alpha-BOLD correlations studied. The largest effect was dependent on the exclusion of voxels in the tissue immediately surrounding veins. Following deveining, the cortical depth profiles showed the negative alpha-BOLD correlations were significantly weaker in the middle depths compared with deep and superficial depths. When a boxcar rather than EEG alpha power was used to model the task, this depth-dependence was not seen, suggesting this was specific to spontaneous alpha-power modulations. In conclusion, we have established a method to non-invasively interrogate the origins of electrophysiological signals. Our alpha-BOLD depth profiles suggest the alpha signal to an eyes open-closed task is generated in superficial and deep layers suggesting top-down processes.",

    "content": "The progressive degeneration of dopaminergic projections to the striatum is a key disease mechanism in Parkinson's disease (PD). To define the cellular landscape in the parkinsonian striatum, we mapped the cell-type specific transcriptional landscape in early and progressive PD mouse models and in human PD stages. Our analyses revealed substantial transcriptomic changes across both neuronal and glial populations, with astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct disease-associated gene expression profiles. Notably, progressive dopamine depletion uncovered differential neuronal vulnerability, identifying eccentric striatal projection neurons (SPNs) and Chst9-expressing direct-pathway SPNs as among the most resilient subtypes in both species. This cross-species resource establishes a comprehensive framework for investigating cell-state dynamics in the parkinsonian striatum and uncovers selectively vulnerable and resistant cell types that can inspire new therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "Teneurin-4 switches between self-recognition and canonical Latrophilin binding to direct neuronal migration",
    "content": "Cortical migration is a complex process in which neurons migrate along radial glial cells (RGC) to form functional layers. Teneurins (Ten1-4) play a role by interacting with Latrophilins (Lphn/ADGRL1-3). Teneurins are also known as cell adhesion molecules, but how homophilic and heterophilic Teneurin interactions are integrated is unknown. Here, single-particle-cryo-EM data of Ten2 shows that canonical Latrophilin-binding is sterically incompatible with Ten2-dimerisation, making these interactions exclusive. We engineered surface mutations that specifically disrupt Ten2-Ten2 or Ten2-Latrophilin interactions. These are transferrable to Ten4, suggesting conserved binding mechanisms. Proteomics, in-vivo-gene-editing and super-resolution-microscopy show that Ten4 is expressed along RGC fibres and that migrating neurons switch from low-to-high Ten4-expression. Ten4 expression is highest in the cortical plate where Ten4-Ten4 interactions reduce RGC-attachment. In the intermediate zone, Ten4-Latrophilin interactions are required to promote neuron-RGC association. The results show how Ten4 orchestrates cortical migration by exclusive structural mechanisms, underpinning the integration of distinct migration programmes.",

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN! We\u2019re Akshay and Jake. We put together a tool called Haystack to make pull requests straightforward to read.<p>What Haystack does:<p>-- Builds a clear narrative. Changes in Haystack aren\u2019t just arranged as unordered diffs. Instead, they unfold in a logical order, each paired with an explanation in plain, precise language<p>-- Focuses attention where it counts. Routine plumbing and refactors are put into skimmable sections so you can spend your time on design and correctness<p>-- Provides full cross-file context. Every new or changed function/variable is traced across the codebase, showing how it\u2019s used beyond the immediate diff<p>Here\u2019s a quick demo: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/w5Lq5wBUS-I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/w5Lq5wBUS-I</a><p>If you\u2019d like to give it a spin, head over to haystackeditor.com/review! We set up some demo PRs that you should be able to understand and review even if you\u2019ve never seen the repos before!<p>We used to work at big companies, where reviewing non-trivial pull requests felt like reading a book with its pages out of order. We would jump and scroll between files, trying to piece together the author\u2019s intent before we could even start reviewing. And, as authors, we would spend time to restructure our own commits just to make them readable.\nAI has made this even trickier. Today it\u2019s not uncommon for a pull request to contain code the author doesn\u2019t fully understand themselves!<p>So, we built Haystack to help reviewers spend less time untangling code and more time giving meaningful feedback. We would love to hear about whether it gets the job done for you!<p>How we got here:<p>Haystack began as (yet another) VS Code fork where we experimented with visualizing code changes on a canvas. At first, it was a neat way to show how pieces of code worked together. But customers started laying out their entire codebase just to make sense of it. That\u2019s when we realized the deeper problem: understanding a codebase is hard, and engineers need better ways to quickly understand unfamiliar code.<p>As we kept building, another insight emerged: with AI woven into workflows, engineers don\u2019t always need to master every corner of a codebase to ship features. But in code review, deep and continuous context still matters, especially to separate what\u2019s important to review from plumbing and follow-on changes.<p>So we pivoted. We took what we\u2019d learned and worked closely with engineers to refine the idea. We started with simple code analysis (using language servers, tree-sitter, etc.) to show how changes relate. Then we added AI to explain and organize those changes and to trace how data moves through a pull request. Finally, we fused the two by empowering AI agents to use static analyses. Step by step, that became the Haystack we\u2019re showing today.<p>We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45201703\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45201703</a></p>\n<p>Points: 58</p>\n<p># Comments: 38</p>",

    "title": "Facial Micro-Movements as a Proxy of Increasingly Erratic Heart Rate Variability While Experiencing Pressure Pain",
    "content": "The sensation of pain varies from person to person. These patterns of individual variations are difficult to capture using coarse subjective self-reports. However, they are important when prescribing therapies and tailoring them to the person 's own sensations. Pain can be experienced differently by the same person, and fluctuate differently depending on the context, yet most analyses treat the problem under a one-size-fits-all model. In this work, we introduce a series of assays to objectively assess pressure pain across tasks with different motoric and cognitive demands, in relation to resting state. In a cohort of healthy individuals, we examine pain-free vs. pain states at rest, during drawing with heavy cognitive demands, during pointing to a visual target, and during a grooved peg task like inserting a grooved key in a matching grooved keyhole. We recorded face videos, electrocardiographic signals and adopt a standardized data type called the micro-movement spikes (MMS) to characterize the biorhythmic activities of the face micro-expressions and of the micro-fluctuations in the heart 's inter beat interval timings. Using the MMS peaks, we find that the continuous Gamma family of probability distribution functions best fit the frequency histograms of both the Face and the heart data. Further, we find that the Gamma shape and scale parameters in both signals span a scaling power law whereby as the noise-to-signal ratio (Gamma scale parameter) increases, so does the randomness of the stochastic process (the Gamma shape decreases towards the memoryless exponential range). We find that as the heart IBI turns more erratic (noisier and more random) the facial ophthalmic region increases the noise and randomness too, with higher linear correlation for tasks requiring haptic feedback (R2 0.84) than for tasks requiring higher cognitive and memory loads (R2 0.77). Increases in transfer entropy shows that recent past activity (~167ms back) of the heart IBI and Face combined lower the uncertainty in the prediction of the present ophthalmic-Face activity, suggesting that this Face region may serve as a proxy of an increasingly dysregulated heart. These results bear implications for the detection and monitoring of pressure pain and heart dysregulated states.",

    "title": "Permethrin elicits chemoreceptive responses on different Anopheles gambiae sensory appendages.",
    "content": "Non-contact detection of pyrethroid insecticides by malaria mosquitoes has been unveiled and may contribute to the evolution of mosquito behavioral modifications against vector control tools. However, the mechanisms underlying this detection are not yet fully understood. It has been hypothesized that the spatial repellency of pyrethroids may be mediated by chemosensory receptors and/or via the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). This study aimed to explore these two hypotheses by identifying which chemosensory appendages in Anopheles gambiae are involved in the non-contact detection of permethrin, a widely used pyrethroid in malaria control. Behavioral responses to permethrin headspace were recorded in female An. gambiae, in which specific sensory appendages were either removed or coated with resin to impair their chemosensory function. Additionally, electrophysiological recordings were performed on different sensory appendages: antennae, palpi and tarsi, to characterize their electrophysiological activity after permethrin stimulation. The behavioral assays revealed that tarsi were primarily responsible for mediating mosquito takeoff responses after permethrin headspace delivery. This finding was supported by significant electrophysiological tarsal responses to the insecticide. In contrast, removal of the antennae did not alter behavioral responses, although electroantennogram recordings indicated neural activity in response to permethrin. Palps showed neither behavioral nor electrophysiological responses. These findings indicate that permethrin is detected through two distinct sensory appendages, tarsi and antennae, but with varying behavioral output. Such appendage-specific detection favors the hypothesis that permethrin detection and the associated behavioral output is mediated by chemosensory receptors rather than by VGSCs. Nonetheless, further investigations are needed to identify the chemosensory receptors and pathways involved in pyrethroid insecticide detection in malaria mosquitoes.",

    "title": "Axon termination of the SAB motor neurons in C. elegans depends on pre- and postsynaptic activity",
    "content": "Axon termination is a critical step in neural circuit formation, but the contribution of activity from postsynaptic targets to this process remains unclear. Using Caenorhabditis elegans SAB neurons as a model system, we showed that inhibition of muscle activity during a critical period of postembryonic development led to axonal overgrowth and ectopic synapse formation. This effect is mediated by a local retrograde signal and requires neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) acting cell-autonomously to constrain axon growth. Manipulating SAB neuron excitability demonstrated that increased intrinsic neuronal activity drives overgrowth, while reducing activity suppresses it, establishing a functional link between muscle-derived cues and presynaptic excitability. Transcriptomic analysis and genetic studies further implicate the neuropeptides FLP-18 and NLP-12 as essential modulators of this activity-dependent process. Our findings reveal a temporally and spatially restricted retrograde signaling mechanism in motor neurons, where target activity, neuronal calcium dynamics and neuropeptide signaling cooperate to ensure proper axon termination. These results highlight conserved principles of activity-dependent regulation at neuromuscular junctions and provide a framework for understanding how motor circuits integrate target feedback to sculpt precise connectivity.",

    "title": "Differences in dynamic functional connectivity between naturalistic music listening and rest in preadolescents",
    "content": "IntroductionEngagement with music is a significant aspect of adolescents' lives and this interest blossoms during preadolescence. Compared to the extensive body of research focused on adult music brain function, relatively few studies have examined the neural connections involved in music listening among adolescents and preadolescents. This study aims to investigate the dynamic patterns of brain functional connectivity and the transition processes during naturalistic music listening in preadolescents, measuring the transition of brain states from one time point to the next.MethodsWe employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity of 24 healthy preadolescents aged 8 to 12 years during both music listening and rest conditions. Subsequently, we applied a dynamic functional connectivity analysis, Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), to extract distinct brain states (phase locking patterns) and the corresponding transition processes.ResultsFindings show that occipital brain regions are actively engaged during music listening, possibly linked to attention regulation, visual imagery, and emotional processing. Additionally, we observed a more frequent transition from the default mode network (DMN) state to an orbitofrontal limbic state during music listening, evidencing cognitive shifts that facilitate emotional and reward processing. In contrast, during rest, we obtained a switch to the sensorimotor auditory network, suggesting intrinsic fluctuations in multiple networks.DiscussionThese findings deepen our understanding of subcortical and frontal brain connectivity in preadolescents during music listening, with implications for integrating music into educational practices to support learning and cognitive development.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe mirror neuron system (MNS) activates during the performance of an action and during the observation of the same action being performed by another. At the motor output level, MNS activation manifests as motor resonance, or a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focuses on how and to what extent motor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of motor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years on average. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was performed to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation under various conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions), motor learning was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task.ResultsWe observed a statistically significant decrease in reaction time during the process of learning within the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting putative mirror neuron activity. We found a significant correlation between the learning speed of the non-dominant hand and mirror neuron activation in the dominant hemisphere during the observation of button presses and pinch gestures.ConclusionThe MNS excitability is not a predictor of motor learning, but motor learning is reflected in the characteristics of the MNS.",

    "title": "Assessing consciousness in patients with locked-in syndrome using their EEG",
    "content": "Research indicates that locked-in syndrome (LIS) patients retain both consciousness and cognitive functions, despite their inability to perform voluntary muscle movements or communicate. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) provide a means for these patients to communicate, which is crucial, as the ability to interact with their environment has been shown to significantly enhance their wellbeing and quality of life. This paper presents an innovative approach to analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data from four LIS patients to assess their consciousness levels, referred to as normalized consciousness levels (NCL) in this study. It consists of extracting different features based on frequency, complexity, and connectivity measures to maximize the probability of correctly determining the patients' actual states given the inexistence of ground truth. The consciousness levels derived from this approach aim to improve our understanding of the patients' condition, which is vital in order to build effective communication systems. Despite considerable inter-patient variability, the findings indicate that the approach is effective in detecting neural markers of consciousness and in differentiating between states across the majority of patients. By accurately assessing consciousness, this research aims to improve diagnosis in addition to determining the optimal time to initiate communication with these non-communicative patients. It is important to note that consciousness is a complex and difficult concept to define. In this study, the term \u201cconsciousness level\u201d does not refer to a medical definition. Instead, it represents a scale of NCL values ranging from 0 to 1 representing the likelihood of the patient being fully conscious (1) or not (0).",

    "title": "Akkermansia muciniphila in neurological disorders: mechanisms and therapeutic potential via the gut-brain axis",
    "content": "In recent years, the role of Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) in neurological diseases has attracted increasing attention. As a probiotic, A. muciniphila is closely associated with host health, metabolism, and immunity, demonstrating therapeutic potential in various conditions such as obesity, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and liver disorders. In the context of neurological diseases, A. muciniphila significantly influences the host brain through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA). This review summarizes the roles and mechanisms of A. muciniphila and its active components (e.g., the outer membrane protein Amuc_1100, extracellular vesicles AmEVs, and short-chain fatty acids SCFAs) in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), depression, cerebral palsy (CP), epilepsy (EP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It exerts protective effects by enhancing the intestinal barrier, regulating lipid metabolism, producing SCFAs, secreting neuroactive substances, and inhibiting neuroinflammation, thereby suggesting novel therapeutic avenues for neurological disorders. However, due to limited data from large-scale human clinical trials and the complexity of disease mechanisms and host\u2013microbiota interactions, its clinical translation faces considerable challenges. Future efforts should focus on multicenter randomized controlled trials and in-depth mechanistic studies utilizing technologies such as metabolomics to facilitate evidence-based clinical application.",

    "title": "Mutant mouse models implicate a role for mGluR1/5, prolyl isomerase (Pin1) and Homer1a interactions in wakefulness",
    "content": "IntroductionHealthy sleep and wake are integral to good health and occur when an organism is able to maintain long bouts of both sleep and wakefulness. Homer proteins have been shown to be important for sleep in both Drosophila and mice. For example, genetic deletion of Homer1a in mice results in failure to sustain long bouts of wakefulness. Homer1a has also been shown to amplify mGluR activity by facilitating binding of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 to mGluR. This study uses mouse models to evaluate whether the Homer1a null sleep phenotype may be dependent on the mGluR-Pin1 interaction and examines sleep/wake behavior.MethodsEEG recordings were used to determine and compare sleep and wake in three different mouse models and their littermate control mice. Mouse models included: mGluR(TS-AA) knock-in mice in which Pin1 binding is prevented and activity-dependent prolyl isomerization of mGluR is inhibited; mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice in which Homer binding is eliminated but Pin1 binding is allowed; and a Homer1a null, mGluR(F-R) double mutant mouse to evaluate whether Pin1 binding can rescue the Homer1a knock-out phenotype. Sleep-wake behavior was analyzed using traditional summary measures and a spike-and-slab mixture distribution to better characterize microarchitecture.ResultsKnock-in mGluR(TS-AA) mice display a reduced ability to sustain long bouts of wakefulness during the active lights off period, recapitulating part of the previously observed wake phenotype of the Homer1a knock-out mouse. Alteration of the Homer binding site to mGluR in mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice has no effect on the sleep phenotype, whereas crossing the mGluR(F-R) knock-in into the Homer null background resulted in increased duration of long wake bouts, suggesting a restored ability to maintain wakefulness, with other sleep/wake characteristics similar to littermate mice.ConclusionThese studies highlight the role of Pin1 binding to mGluR as a potential mechanism in the control of sleep/wake behavior. Future studies should explore whether other binding partners of Homer and mGluR also affect sleep and wake.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the prognostic impact of collateral circulation on outcomes of direct thrombectomy (DT) versus bridging thrombectomy (BT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO).MethodThis retrospective study included 460 AIS patients with anterior circulation LVO who underwent either DT (n\u202f=\u202f220) or BT (n\u202f=\u202f240). Collateral status was assessed using multiphase computed tomographic angiography. The primary outcome was functional prognosis at 3\u202fmonths, measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Prognostic factors for good prognosis (90-day mRS\u202f\u2264\u202f2) and adverse events were identified through multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.ResultsThe BT group had significantly higher rates of intracerebral hemorrhage and hemorrhagic transformation compared to the DT group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Good collateral circulation was independently associated with good prognosis and lower risk of serious adverse events (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Lower NIHSS scores, shorter OTR, absence of atrial fibrillation, and lower serum BNP levels were also significantly associated with favorable outcomes in AIS patients (all p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Elevated serum BNP levels increased the risk of serious adverse events in both DT and BT groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). ROC analysis showed that a combined model including NIHSS, BNP, collateral circulation, onset-to-reperfusion time, and atrial fibrillation achieved high predictive performance for good prognosis (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.907, 95% CI: 0.881\u20130.934, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).ConclusionCollateral circulation is a strong predictor of both functional recovery and risk of adverse events in AIS patients undergoing thrombectomy, regardless of treatment strategy. While serum BNP may offer additional prognostic value, its moderate performance and overlap with cardiovascular conditions suggest that it should be interpreted cautiously. Pre-intervention collateral assessment remains a valuable tool for guiding individualized treatment decisions.",

    "title": "Periodic and aperiodic contributions to EEG delta power are translatable and complementary Angelman syndrome biomarkers",
    "content": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of maternal UBE3A expression. With promising AS therapies now in clinical trials, there is a pressing need for reliable and translatable biomarkers. Elevated EEG delta power is a hallmark of AS and a promising biomarker, but traditional measures conflate delta oscillations with broadband spectral shifts, limiting interpretability and utility. We dissociated periodic and aperiodic contributions to delta power using spectral parameterization in children with AS and Ube3a mutant mice. In both species, elevated delta power reflected a combination of increased periodic delta oscillations and elevated aperiodic slope and offset. These features were linked to different behavioral domains and followed divergent developmental trajectories, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. Together, our findings establish aperiodic changes as a novel translatable EEG biomarker for AS and support the complementary use of periodic and aperiodic features in preclinical and clinical research.",

A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Anomalous experiences are associated with high subconscious connectedness.",
    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "title": "When the unconscious contents are expressed in both Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS) and dreams: An experimental study.",
    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

We developed a novel dataset containing a wide range of motion data from 49 users in five different XR applications: four XR games with distinct tasks and action patterns, and an additional social XR application with no predefined task sets. The dataset is used to evaluate the performance and, in particular, the generalization capacity of the two models across applications. Our results indicate that while the models can accurately identify individuals within the same application, their ability to identify users across different XR applications remains limited. Overall, our results provide insight into current models generalization capabilities and suitability as biometric methods for user verification and identification. The results also serve as a much-needed risk assessment of hazardous and unwanted user identification in XR and Metaverse applications. Our cross-application XR motion dataset and code are made available to the public to encourage similar research on the generalization of motion-based user identification in typical Metaverse application use cases.",

    "title": "Bias in the Loop: How Humans Evaluate AI-Generated Suggestions",
    "content": "arXiv:2509.08514v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human-AI collaboration increasingly drives decision-making across industries, from medical diagnosis to content moderation. While AI systems promise efficiency gains by providing automated suggestions for human review, these workflows can trigger cognitive biases that degrade performance. We know little about the psychological factors that determine when these collaborations succeed or fail. We conducted a randomized experiment with 2,784 participants to examine how task design and individual characteristics shape human responses to AI-generated suggestions. Using a controlled annotation task, we manipulated three factors: AI suggestion quality in the first three instances, task burden through required corrections, and performance-based financial incentives. We collected demographics, attitudes toward AI, and behavioral data to assess four performance metrics: accuracy, correction activity, overcorrection, and undercorrection. Two patterns emerged that challenge conventional assumptions about human-AI collaboration. First, requiring corrections for flagged AI errors reduced engagement and increased the tendency to accept incorrect suggestions, demonstrating how cognitive shortcuts influence collaborative outcomes. Second, individual attitudes toward AI emerged as the strongest predictor of performance, surpassing demographic factors. Participants skeptical of AI detected errors more reliably and achieved higher accuracy, while those favorable toward automation exhibited dangerous overreliance on algorithmic suggestions. The findings reveal that successful human-AI collaboration depends not only on algorithmic performance but also on who reviews AI outputs and how review processes are structured. Effective human-AI collaborations require consideration of human psychology: selecting diverse evaluator samples, measuring attitudes, and designing workflows that counteract cognitive biases.",

However, large feature sizes, high resistance materials, and limitations of printable control circuitry mean that deployable devices cannot be printed without post-print assembly steps. To address these challenges, we present Printegrated Circuits, a technique that uses traditional electronics as material to 3D print self-contained interactive objects. Embedded PCBs are placed into recesses during a pause in the print, and through a process we term \\textit{Prinjection}, conductive filament is injected into their plated-through holes. This automatically creates reliable electrical and mechanical contact, eliminating the need for manual wiring or bespoke connectors. We describe the custom machine code generation that supports our approach, and characterise its electrical and mechanical properties. With our 6 demonstrations, we highlight how the Printegrated Circuits process fits into existing design and prototyping workflows as well as informs future research agendas.",

We present GlyphWeaver, a novel interactive system to enable an easy creation of expressive glyph visualizations. Our system comprises three key components: a glyph domain-specific language (GDSL), a GDSL operation management mechanism, and a multimodal interaction interface. The GDSL is a hierarchical container model, where each container is independent and composable, providing a rigorous yet practical foundation for complex glyph visualizations. The operation management mechanism restricts modifications of the GDSL to atomic operations, making it accessible without requiring direct coding. The multimodal interaction interface enables direct manipulation, natural language commands, and parameter adjustments. A multimodal large language model acts as a translator, converting these inputs into GDSL operations. GlyphWeaver significantly lowers the barrier for designers, who often do not have extensive programming skills, to create sophisticated glyph visualizations. A case study and user interviews with 13 participants confirm its substantial gains in design efficiency and effectiveness of producing creative glyph visualizations.",

Informed by expert interviews and literature review, HyperMOOC employs multi-glyph designs for different knowledge types and multi-stage interactions for deeper understanding. Using a timeline-based radial visualization, learners can grasp cognitive paths of concepts and navigate courses through hyperlink-based interactions. We evaluated HyperMOOC through a user study with 36 MOOC learners and interviews with two instructors. Results demonstrate that HyperMOOC enhances learners' learning effect and efficiency on MOOCs, with participants showing higher satisfaction and improved course understanding compared to traditional video-based learning approaches.",

This study presents a comprehensive eye-tracking analysis framework of the Inhibitory Control Game, named the ReStroop game, which is an educational intervention aimed at improving inhibitory control skills in children through a recycling-themed sorting task, for educational assessment that processes raw gaze data through unified algorithms for fixation detection, performance evaluation, and personalized intervention planning. The system employs dual-threshold eye movement detection (I-VT and advanced clustering), comprehensive Area of Interest (AOI) analysis, and evidence-based risk assessment to transform gaze patterns into actionable educational insights. We evaluated this framework across three difficulty levels and revealed critical attention deficits, including low task relevance, elevated attention scatter, and compromised processing efficiency. The multi-dimensional risk assessment identified high to moderate risk levels, triggering personalized interventions including focus training, attention regulation support, and environmental modifications. The system successfully distinguishes between adaptive learning and cognitive overload, providing early warning indicators for educational intervention. Results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in objective attention assessment, early risk identification, and the generation of evidence-based recommendations for students, teachers, and specialists, supporting data-driven educational decision-making and personalized learning approaches.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08353v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper introduces an innovative adaptive scoring framework for children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD) that is attributed to the integration of multiple metrics, such as spatial attention patterns, temporal engagement, and game performance data, to create a comprehensive assessment of learning that goes beyond traditional game scoring. The framework employs a progressive difficulty adaptation method, which focuses on specific stimuli for each level and adjusts weights dynamically to accommodate increasing cognitive load and learning complexity. Additionally, it includes capabilities for temporal analysis, such as detecting engagement periods, providing rewards for sustained attention, and implementing an adaptive multiplier framework based on performance levels. To avoid over-rewarding high performers while maximizing improvement potential for students who are struggling, the designed framework features an adaptive temporal impact framework that adjusts performance scales accordingly. We also established a multi-metric validation framework using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson correlation, and Spearman correlation, along with defined quality thresholds for assessing deployment readiness in educational settings. This research bridges the gap between technical eye-tracking metrics and educational insights by explicitly mapping attention patterns to learning behaviors, enabling actionable pedagogical interventions.",

    "title": "Componentization: Decomposing Monolithic LLM Responses into Manipulable Semantic Units",
    "content": "arXiv:2509.08203v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce monolithic text that is hard to edit in parts, which can slow down collaborative workflows. We present componentization, an approach that decomposes model outputs into modular, independently editable units while preserving context. We describe Modular and Adaptable Output Decomposition (MAOD), which segments responses into coherent components and maintains links among them, and we outline the Component-Based Response Architecture (CBRA) as one way to implement this idea. Our reference prototype, MAODchat, uses a microservices design with state-machine-based decomposition agents, vendor-agnostic model adapters, and real-time component manipulation with recomposition.\n  In an exploratory study with four participants from academic, engineering, and product roles, we observed that component-level editing aligned with several common workflows and enabled iterative refinement and selective reuse. Participants also mentioned possible team workflows. Our contributions are: (1) a definition of componentization for transforming monolithic outputs into manipulable units, (2) CBRA and MAODchat as a prototype architecture, (3) preliminary observations from a small user study, (4) MAOD as an algorithmic sketch for semantic segmentation, and (5) example Agent-to-Agent protocols for automated decomposition. We view componentization as a promising direction for turning passive text consumption into more active, component-level collaboration.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08108v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Video content creation offers vital opportunities for expression and participation, yet remains largely inaccessible to creators with sensory impairments, especially in low-resource settings. We conducted interviews with 20 video creators with visual and hearing impairments in Kenya to examine their tools, challenges, and collaborative practices. Our findings show that accessibility barriers and infrastructural limitations shape video creation as a staged, collaborative process involving trusted human partners and emerging AI tools. Across workflows, creators actively negotiated agency and trust, maintaining creative control while bridging sensory gaps. We discuss the need for flexible, interdependent collaboration models, inclusive human-AI workflows, and diverse storytelling practices. This work broadens accessibility research in HCI by examining how technology and social factors intersect in low-resource contexts, suggesting ways to better support disabled creators globally.",

    "content": "arXiv:2306.13802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In neuroimaging, extensive post-processing of resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data is necessary for its application and investigation in relation to brain-behavior associations. Such post-processing is used to derive brain representations, lower dimensional feature sets used for brain-behavior association studies. A brain representation involves a choice of dimension reduction (a parcellation into regions or networks) and a choice of feature type, such as spatial topography, connectivity matrix, amplitude. However, widespread variability in rfMRI brain representations has hindered both reproducibility and knowledge accumulation across the field. Brain representation choice effects measurements of inter-subject variability, which muddies the comparison and integration of findings. We leveraged persistent homology on the subject-space topologies induced by 34 different brain representations to enable direct comparison of brain representations in the context of individual differences. Our findings reveal the importance of considering feature type when comparing results derived from different brain representations, suggesting best practices for assessing the replicability and generalizability of brain-behavior research in rfMRI data.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.06810v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely assign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However, this flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here, we propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a capacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners create a \"compressed\" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal) which is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon receiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting learning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent with our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically impaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space structure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to correlate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal valuation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We leverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work suggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex goal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive mechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the neuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral techniques that support people in achieving their goals.",

However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the same eight NSD participants for 284 synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, we provide a proof of principle that OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with the original NSD data; we demonstrate that the degree of OOD (quantified as the distance between a set of responses and the training data used for modeling) is predictive of the magnitude of model failures; and we show that the concept of OOD is not restricted to artificial stimuli but can be usefully applied even within the domain of naturalistic stimuli. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08779v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls), employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy. Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner 2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation. ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.",

However, CTh forecasting is a challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet), which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.",

We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic, label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing. Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing tailored to each model (per-window min--max for adversarial training; per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch band-power deltas ($\\Delta\\delta,\\ \\Delta\\theta,\\ \\Delta\\alpha,\\ \\Delta\\beta$), channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage.

In this study, we propose a novel co-simulation multiscale approach that unifies both micro- and macroscales to more rigorously capture brain dynamics. The presented design considers the electrodiffusive activity across the brain and in the network defined by the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus that is implicated in the mechanics of PD, as well as the contribution of presynaptic inputs in the highlighted regions. The application of DBS and its effects, along with the inclusion of stochastic noise are also examined. We found that the thalamus exhibits large, fluctuating spiking in both the deterministic and stochastic conditions, suggesting that noise contributes primarily to neural variability, rather than driving the overall spiking activity. Ultimately, this work intends to provide greater insights into the dynamics of PD and the brain which can eventually be converted into clinical use.",

Fundamentally, collectives have greater computational resources with more sensory information, more memory, more processing capacity, and more ways to act. While greater resources present opportunities, there are also challenges in coordination and cooperation inherent in collectives with distributed, modular structures. Despite these challenges, we show how collective resource advantages lead directly to well-known forms of collective intelligence including the wisdom of the crowd, collective sensing, division of labour, and cultural learning. Our framework also generates testable predictions about collective capabilities in distributed reasoning and context-dependent behavioural switching. Through case studies of animal navigation and decision-making, we demonstrate how collectives leverage their computational resources to solve problems not only more effectively than individuals, but by using qualitatively different problem-solving strategies.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.07991v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep learning models have been frequently used to decode a single brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG). It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\\%, 59.88\\%, and 59.56\\%, respectively. We made an initial attempt to develop a general model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification, avoiding retraining or redevelopment for each paradigm. This study paves the way for the development of an effective but simple model for cross-BCI-paradigm decoding, which might benefit the design of portable devices for universal BCI decoding.",

    "title": "Craniometric guidance for the Sylvian vein",
    "content": "ObjectivesThe Sylvian vein (SV) is the primary anatomical landmark on the lateral surface of the brain. For the neurosurgical approach, recognizing the SV is essential information. With the trend toward minimally invasive surgery, precise anatomical localization becomes increasingly important. Moreover, a craniometric guidance for the SV will reliably enhance neurosurgical planning and intraoperative approach. Anatomical guidance for the SV was previously proposed, and it utilized a linear bar type. However, its representation was complex and unclear. Thus, we aimed to develop a new guidance for the SV.Materials and methodsThe SV of thirty-seven patients was illustrated on venous phase angiographic images. Scanned images were manually fused using Adobe Photoshop CS5. The outlines of the lateral skulls were realigned to fit together, after which venous structures were overlaid. Coronal sutures and posterior clinoid processes served as references during this realignment process. Half the length of the line connecting the external ear canal (EAC) and glabella was used to draw a circle (Sylvian circle). The Sylvian circle (SC) and the actual course of the SVs were then compared. The SV and SC distributions were measured using ImageJ (NIH).ResultsTwenty-nine (79%) of the thirty-seven patients exhibited SV located within 5\u202fmm of the SC. Five SVs were positioned above the SC, and two were placed below it. There was a total of seven cases in which the trajectory was within 5\u202fmm of the SC and accounted for less than 80% of the path.ConclusionThe SC represents the contour of the SV more accurately than a straight line. The SC can be drawn promptly and is instinctively applicable in pre- and intra-operative neurosurgical practice.",

    "title": "Assessment of dynamic stability and identification of key tasks and parameters in patients with unilateral and bilateral vestibulopathy: a laboratory-based study",
    "content": "Chronic imbalance is the cardinal symptom in bilateral vestibulopathy patients (BV), and in a subset of symptomatic unilateral vestibulopathy patients (UV), leading to a significant impact on their daily lives. Despite these profound effects, such as the risk of falls, the mechanism of imbalance remains complex, posing challenges both for monitoring patients\u2019 functional status and for evaluating rehabilitation therapies. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamic stability of patients with BV and UV during multiple motor tasks and to provide a summary of the most relevant tasks and biomechanical parameters. The purpose was to propose a \u201cshort-form FGA\u201d (Functional Gait Assessment) test to reduce the length and complexity of tests, to be able to evaluate future therapies longitudinally, and to monitor functional follow-up of patients. Dynamic stability, spatio-temporal and kinematic parameters were calculated for 10 BV patients, 10 UV patients and 10 asymptomatic controls while walking at three self-selected walking speeds, while performing dual tasks and while completing the 10 tasks of the FGA battery. Two (validity and interpretability) of the four COSMIN domains and clinical applicability were evaluated to identify relevant tasks and parameters to the study population, i.e., good discriminant and convergent validity, and good clinical applicability. The comfortable and slow gait, as well as the turn pivot, eyes closed, and tandem walk tasks were identified as the most relevant for characterizing dynamic stability in these patients. Easily interpretable and visually assessable parameters, such as walking speed, center of mass displacement, step width, trunk movement, stiffness of the head/trunk, and number of steps, were identified as the most relevant. In contrast, stability parameters such as margin of stability or whole body angular momentum did not prove to be effective parameters. These relevant parameters should enable future studies to evaluate rehabilitation therapies such as vestibular implants or physiotherapy, as well as to monitor patients\u2019 functional status. Future studies should validate these results and assess the missing psychometric properties of these parameters.",

    "title": "Object-scene semantics correlation analysis for image emotion classification",
    "content": "IntroductionImage emotion classification (IEC), which predicts human emotional perception from images, is a research highlight for its wide applications. Recently, most existing methods have focused on predicting emotions by mining semantic information. However, the \u201caffective gap\u201d between low-level pixels and high-level emotions constrains semantic representation and degrades model performance. It has been demonstrated in psychology that emotions can be triggered by the interaction between meaningful objects and their rich surroundings within an image. Inspired by this, we propose an Object-Scene Attention Fusion Network (OSAFN) that leverages object-level concepts and scene-level reasoning as auxiliary information for enhanced emotional classification.MethodsThe proposed OSAFN designs two different strategies to extract semantic information. Specifically, concepts are selected by utilizing an external concept extraction tool, and an Appraisal-based Chain-of-Thought (Appraisal-CoT) prompting is introduced to guide large language models in generating scene information. Next, two different attention-based modules are developed for aligning semantic features with visual features to enhance visual representations. Then, an adaptive fusion strategy is introduced for integrating the results of both the object-semantic stream and the scene-semantic stream. Additionally, a polarity-aware contrastive loss is proposed to model the hierarchical structure of emotions, improving the discrimination of fine-grained emotional categories.Results and discussionTo evaluate the effectiveness of OSAFN, we conducted numerical experiments on four affective datasets. The results demonstrate that OSAFN achieves superior performance and represents a notable contribution in the field of IEC.",

Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects.

We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample.

    "content": "When beliefs in autobiographical memories are reduced while recollections remain relatively intact, a phenomenon termed nonbelieved memories (NBMs) unfolds. The current preregistered study (<em>N</em> = 104) used a 3-week longitudinal design to investigate the relationships between the frequency of recalled NBMs, memory distrust, rumination over autobiographical events, and self-esteem. Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Dissociation is a phenomenon present in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders as well as in the general population. The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: There is a need for effective cognitive assessment tools to evaluate the development of very young children in resource-limited low- and middle-income country settings. Our objective was to evaluate the field usability of a computer-based attention test and its concurrent validity with a caregiver-reported screener of neurodevelopment in rural, Ecuadorian children. Method: To assess a computer-based attention test in a resource-limited setting, 41 Ecuadorian children between 2 and 4 years of age were evaluated once with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention adapted to eye-tracking instrumentation. To evaluate the validity of the ECVT, results were compared with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133, measured 3\u20134 times between 21 and 48 months of age. Results: ECVT measures were collected successfully for 97.6% of children (40/41), suggesting good field usability of the test in this resource-limited setting. An increase in 1 SD in child attention, as measured by the ECVT average fixation duration, was associated with a 7.9-point increase in the overall Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133 score (95% CI [1.5, 14.2], <em>p</em> = .015). Conclusions: A computer-based attention assessment in early childhood was usable in a resource-limited setting and predictive of a caregiver-reported screener of child neurodevelopment. The ECVT, therefore, can be used to assess the effects of early risk factors and resilience in brain/behavior development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index \u201cspeed\u201d potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. Method: The present study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children aged 8\u201312 with and without ADHD (<em>N</em> = 119). Results: There was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the <em>tau</em> parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD and among children with low working memory capacity (regardless of ADHD status). Variance in <em>tau</em> was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of adopting analytic methods that can more accurately describe performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here, we determine whether familiarizing individuals with self-appraisal with daily memory testing for 7 days provide a more accurate estimate of cognitive functioning and mood. Method: Two hundred twenty-five participants (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> \u00b1 <em>SD</em>: 74.1 \u00b1 8.3 years; 66% female; median education 16.0 years) completed the online Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health, which included two associative memory tasks, for seven consecutive days. Each day, participants self-appraised their performance. At baseline, they completed various cognitive and mood measures. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between task performance and self-appraisal on Days 1 and 7 and used linear models to examine the relationship between self-appraisal scores and clinical measures. Results: Accuracy (Day 1: 0.44 \u00b1 0.12; Day 7: 0.81 \u00b1 0.16) and self-appraisal (Day 1: 0.36 \u00b1 0.15; Day 7: 0.70 \u00b1 0.21) increased, as did the association between accuracy and self-appraisal, Day 1: correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [0.09, 0.34], <em>p</em> = .001; Day 7: <em>r</em> = 0.69, 95% CI [0.62, 0.76], <em>p</em> < .001. Self-appraisal scores on Day 7, but not Day 1, showed significant relationships with in-clinic measures. Conclusions: Repeated remote cognitive assessments may help elucidate individuals\u2019 capacities to refine their self-perception of cognitive performance during multiday learning. The weak association between accuracy and test-na\u00efve self-appraisal warrants caution about using this metric cross-sectionally. Experienced self-appraisal could be especially relevant at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when subtle learning difficulties emerge and could improve our capacity to detect early meta-cognitive changes.

    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychological norms serve to identify cognitive impairment and monitor neurodegenerative disease progression. However, longitudinal data are limited, and conventional approaches do not account for biomarkers to exclude underlying Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, reducing sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive decline in preclinical AD. To address these limitations, this research provides robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms derived from Spanish individuals with nonpathological levels of AD biomarkers. Method: We analyzed 3-year follow-up data from 350 cognitively unimpaired individuals (Alzheimer\u2019s and Families+ cohort). A subset of 228 individuals with normal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242/40, phosphorylated-tau181, and total-tau biomarkers defined the robust reference group. Neuropsychological assessment encompassed the Trail Making Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Memory Binding Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013IV, Wechsler Memory Scale\u2013IV, Semantic Fluency Test, and Judgment of Line Orientation from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Using the Reliable Change Index and Standardized Regression-Based methods, robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms were derived from the reference group. Validation analysis assessed the sensitivity of robust versus conventional normative procedures. Results: Models, equations, percentiles, and cutoffs for identifying significant cognitive decline were provided. Robust norms showed modestly greater sensitivity in certain measures, particularly in episodic memory. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: Total Free Delayed Recall showed the most notable result at the 5th percentile in Reliable Change Index (\u03c7\u00b2 = 16.06, <em>p</em> = 6.15E-05).

    "title": "Posttraumatic stress symptomatology rather than mild traumatic brain injury is related to atypical early neural processing during cognitive control.",
    "content": "Objective: Many veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) report disruptions in cognition; however, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these cognitive difficulties are not well understood. It is also unknown whether PTSD symptomatology or past mTBIs uniquely impact functions important to adaptation such as cognitive control. Method: We examined event-related potentials elicited by a flanker task to evaluate brain responses during conflict monitoring in a sample of 192 U.S. military veterans with combat-zone experience and exposure to explosive blasts. Clinical assessments characterized diagnoses as well as the severity of PTSD symptoms and mTBI so that we could parse overlapping syndromes and directly contrast effects of the two conditions. Results: Across groups, participants performed worse on conflict trials (Incongruent distractors), particularly when preceded by a no-conflict (Congruent distractors) trial. We found that greater dysphoric PTSD symptomatology was related to a reduced early perceptual response (P1), while greater avoidance PTSD symptomatology predicted a larger early visual attention response (N1). Although late cognitive processes (N2, P3) were sensitive to cognitive control demands of the flanker task, posttraumatic symptomatology and mTBI severity were unrelated to them. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the Avoidance and Dysphoria domains of PTSD symptomatology may differentially relate to early neural functions of perception and visual attention rather than later cognitive responses. Rehabilitation and treatment of individuals with PTSD and mTBI may be most productive when focused on perceptual and attentional processing, which could improve cognitive control.

    "content": "Objectives: Crowding refers to the phenomenon whereby small visual objects above the acuity threshold are detected but unrecognizable when surrounded by nearby stimuli. It affects reading in healthy individuals and can be enhanced in reading impairments. By increasing the interletter space, crowding decreases. Previous evidence on patients with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and peripheral dyslexia has shown a dissociation in sensitivity to spacing manipulation between those who mainly produced omissions and those characterized by substitutions in reading. Here, we wanted to verify the hypothesis that the reading impairment mainly characterized by substitutions is dissociated from USN, unlike the one characterized by omissions. Method: In a retrospective study, we collected 38 right-brain-damaged patients, 21 with USN. We analyzed the number and types of errors in reading single words and pseudowords, spaced and unspaced, comparing patients with and without USN. Results: USN patients showed significantly more omissions than patients without USN and increased omissions with letter spacing. Substitutions were more frequent in USN patients but did not increase with spacing. Performance of patients mainly characterized by substitutions revealed a reduction of errors with spaced pseudowords and a double dissociation from USN. Lesion overlap analysis suggested that the two deficits could depend on different components of visuospatial attention networks. Conclusions: We claim that proper neglect dyslexia is characterized by omission errors and has USN as a necessary mechanism, even if not sufficient. Conversely, acquired crowding dyslexia is a different reading deficit, characterized by substitutions due to an enhanced crowding phenomenon, independent of USN.

    "content": "Objective: Cannabis has become increasingly accessible to populations living with chronic health conditions such as HIV. Many people living with HIV are turning to cannabis for symptom relief despite the unclear risks to neurocognitive health. Our study sought to replicate and extend prior research by examining global and domain-specific neurocognitive performance between four groups stratified by use of cannabis (CB; CB+/CB\u2212) and HIV serostatus (HIV+/HIV\u2212). Method: Our demographically diverse community sample (<em>N</em> = 269) underwent exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the effects of cannabis use (CU) and HIV on neurocognition. We explored between-group comparisons of neurocognitive performance, probability of neurocognitive impairment, and interactive effects of CU/HIV serostatus. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed nonsignificant differences in global or domain-specific neurocognitive performance. However, the CB+/HIV+ group was three times (99% CI [1.18, 9.57]) more likely to be labeled with a memory impairment compared to the control (CB-/HIV\u2212), and the CB+/HIV\u2212 group was twice (99% CI [.14, 7.47]) as likely to be labeled with an executive functioning impairment compared to the control. We also identified an interactive effect between the past 30-day CU and HIV serostatus for global (<em>b</em> = \u2212.026, 99% CI [\u2212.04, \u2212.01]) and motor (<em>b</em> = \u2212.052, 99% CI [\u2212.07, \u2212.03]) neurocognitive performance. Findings support a nuanced relationship between CU and HIV, which may partly explain mixed literature. Conclusions: Although we conclude that recent and heavy CU poses risk of neurocognitive decline among people living with HIVs, this effect is modest. Physicians and patients must weigh a possible decrease in global and motor neurocognition against the severity of symptoms being treated.

Here, we explored if there was any relationship between waking-life experiences related to elder relatives with both dreaming about elder relatives and dreaming about animals. For 1 day, 270 participants recorded waking-life experiences in daily diaries before sleeping and recorded their dreams upon waking. Two external judges rated if there was any content related to elder relatives or animals in both daily diaries and dreams. The most three frequent animals in dreams were dogs, cats, and snakes, or fishes, or birds. The frequency of waking-life experiences related to elder relatives was correlated with both the frequency of dreaming about elder relatives and the frequency of dreaming about animals. Yet, the latter two variables were not correlated with each other. The results supported the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. In addition, the results may suggest that some animals in dreams represented elder relatives in waking life metaphorically.

    "title": "The bereavement experience: Dreams and waking experiences of the deceased.",
    "content": "In separate literature\u2014end-of-life experiences, dreams in bereavement, and continuing bonds in bereavement\u2014there are preliminary findings that both dreaming of the deceased and having an experiential encounter while awake are common experiences. The present, brief report is a post hoc analysis of previously unanalyzed items from two studies of bereaved individuals. One study focused on loss following the death of a romantic partner (n = 268) and the other following the death of a dog or cat (n = 199). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had dreamed of the deceased or had a waking experience of seeing, hearing, or feeling the touch of the deceased in the prior month. Consistent with prior research, a substantial portion of each sample (50.7% of the partner loss participants and 32.2% of the pet loss) reported at least one waking experience of seeing, hearing, and/or feeling the deceased. When dreaming of the deceased and/or having a waking experience of the deceased were combined, it was found to be 82.5% for partner loss and 68.2% for pet loss. Furthermore, dreaming about the deceased was related to having such waking experiences. These preliminary, exploratory findings contribute to the growing recognition that we need more research and theory into the function of such experiences for the bereaved and for those facing end of life.

    "content": "Culturally responsive dreamwork (CRD) addresses a significant gap in counseling and psychotherapy by offering an innovative, culturally competent approach for therapeutic dream discussions. By adopting a culturally responsive stance, CRD guides dream discussions without imposing psychological beliefs, acknowledging that many clients view dreams as meaningful cultural, religious, and spiritual experiences. Within CRD is a framework of key areas of focus: sharing, appreciating, finding the significance, and editing. Recognition of these four areas allows therapists to adaptively facilitate dream discussions using their core helping skills and multicultural competence, enabling dreamwork congruent with clients\u2019 beliefs and therapists\u2019 clinical approaches. The article details the need for CRD and its use in therapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Nightmares and the Big Five personality traits: A systematic review and three-level meta-analysis.",
    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Our eyes are never still. Even when fixating, they exhibit small, jittery motions. While it has long been argued that these fixational eye movements (FEMs) aid the acquisition of visual information, a complete theoretical description of their impact on the information available in the early visual system has been lacking. Here we build FEMs into a minimal theoretical model of the early visual response, including the critical process of adaptation (a fading response to a fixed image). We establish the effect of FEMs on the mutual information between a visual stimulus and this response. Our approach identifies the key dimensionless parameters that characterise the effect of fixational eye movements, and reveals the regimes in which this effect can be beneficial, detrimental or negligible. Taking parameter values appropriate for human vision, we show that the spatio-temporal couplings induced by fixational eye movements can explain the qualitative features of the human contrast sensitivity function as well as classic experiments on temporal integration. To our knowledge, the consideration of fixational eye movements in this latter context is novel, and our results suggest the need for future experiments to determine the mechanisms by which spatial and temporal responses are coupled in the human visual system.",

    "title": "Sleep Deprivation Primes Synaptic Vulnerability Without Inducing Oxidative Damage: A Mechanistic Reappraisal",
    "content": "The question of whether sleep deprivation is inherently lethal has remained unresolved due to the inability to separate pure sleep loss from experimental stress. Historical studies dating back over a century have consistently reported that prolonged wakefulness leads to death, but these findings have been confounded by the stressful nature of the experimental interventions used to maintain wakefulness. Recent work has suggested that sleep deprivation-induced lethality may result from accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestines, providing a potential molecular explanation for these long-standing observations. Here we address whether lethality stems from sleep loss itself or experimental stress using stress-controlled sleep deprivation in Drosophila and stress paradigms in both flies and mice. Using real-time feedback-controlled sleep deprivation in Drosophila -- which only stimulates animals when they attempt to sleep -- we found no lethality or intestinal ROS accumulation even after 240 hours of continuous wakefulness. In contrast, both physical perturbation and psychological challenges rapidly induced intestinal ROS accumulation independent of sleep loss, in flies and mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed entirely distinct molecular signatures between sleep deprivation and oxidative stress, demonstrating these represent fundamentally different biological challenges. However, while sleep deprivation alone caused no lethality or intestinal oxidative stress, it increased susceptibility to traumatic brain injury through enhanced synaptic strength. Sleep-deprived flies showed increased mortality when subjected to violent physical challenges, an effect that correlated with synaptic excitability rather than sleep duration, and was rescued by restorative recovery sleep or prevented in mutants lacking synaptic potentiation mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that experimental stress, not sleep loss, drives the oxidative damage and lethality historically attributed to sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation, however, creates conditional vulnerability by transforming the brain into a hyperexcitable state susceptible to trauma, rather than causing cumulative damage.",

    "title": "A neuronal imaging dataset for deep learning in the reconstruction of single-neuron axons",
    "content": "Neuron reconstruction is a critical step in quantifying neuronal structures from imaging data. Advances in molecular labeling techniques and optical imaging technologies have spurred extensive research into the patterns of long-range neuronal projections. However, mapping these projections incurs significant costs, as large-scale reconstruction of individual axonal arbors remains time-consuming. In this study, we present a dataset comprising axon imaging volumes along with corresponding annotations to facilitate the evaluation and development of axon reconstruction algorithms. This dataset, derived from 11 mouse brain samples imaged using fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography, contains carefully selected 852 volume images sized at 192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192 voxels. These images exhibit substantial variations in terms of axon density, image intensity, and signal-to-noise ratios, even within localized regions. Conventional methods often struggle when processing such complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a distance field-supervised segmentation network designed to enhance image signals effectively. Our results demonstrate significantly improved axon detection rates across both state-of-the-art and traditional methodologies. The released dataset and benchmark algorithm provide a data foundation for advancing novel axon reconstruction methods and are valuable for accelerating the reconstruction of long-range axonal projections.",

    "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

This study compared the relative strength of these dispositions in predicting nightmare frequency. A sample of 116 university students completed measures of nightmare frequency, neuroticism, nightmare proneness, thin psychological boundaries, and sensory processing sensitivity. After accounting for sociodemographic variables and dream recall frequency, only nightmare proneness and thin boundaries significantly independently predicted nightmare frequency. These findings highlight the importance of nightmare proneness and thin boundaries as predictors, underscoring the need for further research with diverse samples to better understand these relationships. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "Transformer-based multimodal precision intervention model for enhancing diaphragm function in elderly patients",
    "content": "Diaphragm dysfunction represents a significant complication in elderly patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, often resulting in extended intensive care stays, unsuccessful weaning attempts, and increased healthcare expenditures. To address the deficiency of precise, real-time decision support in this context, a novel artificial intelligence framework is proposed, integrating imaging, physiological signals, and ventilator parameters. Initially, a hierarchical Transformer encoder is employed to extract modality-specific embeddings, followed by an attention-guided cross-modal fusion module and a temporal network for dynamic trend prediction. The framework was assessed using three public datasets, which are, the MIMIC-IV, eICU, and Chest X-ray. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy (92.3% on MIMIC-IV, 91.8% on eICU, 92.0% on Chest X-ray) and surpassed all baselines in precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, the model's probability estimates were well-calibrated, and its SHAP-based explainability analysis identified ventilator volume and key imaging features as primary predictors. The clinical implications of this study are significant. By providing precise and interpretable predictions, the proposed model has the potential to transform critical care practices by offering a pathway to more effective and personalized interventions for high-risk patients.",

    "content": "As global life expectancy rises, a growing proportion of the population is affected by dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Electroencephalography (EEG) based diagnosis presents a non-invasive, cost effective alternative for early detection, yet existing methods are challenged by data scarcity, inter-subject variability, and privacy concerns. This study proposes lightweight and privacy-preserving EEG classification framework combining deep learning and Federated Learning (FL). Five convolutional neural networks (EEGNetv1, EEGNetv4, EEGITNet, EEGInception, EEGInceptionERP) have been evaluated on resting-state EEG dataset comprising 88 subjects. EEG signals are preprocessed using band-pass (1\u201345 Hz) and notch filtering, followed by exponential standardization and 4-second windowing. EEGNetv4 outperformed among other EEG tailored models, and upon utilizing the hybrid fusion techniques it achieves 97.1% accuracy using only 1,609 parameters and less than 1 MB of memory, demonstrating high efficiency. Moreover, FL using FedAvg is implemented across five stratified clients, achieving 96.9% accuracy on the hybrid fused EEGNetV4 model while preserving data privacy. This work establishes a scalable, resource-efficient, and privacy-compliant framework for EEG-based dementia diagnosis, suitable for deployment in real-world clinical and edge-device settings.",

    "title": "Maximizing theoretical and practical storage capacity in single-layer feedforward neural networks",
    "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "content": "Phonological alternations are common in speech, but the neurocognitive mechanisms for their encoding during word production remain unclear. Mandarin Tone 3 sandhi is an example of phonological alternation, whereby the Tone 3 (T3), a low-dipping tone, changes to a Tone 2 (T2)-like rising tone when followed by another T3. Previous research indicates that both the underlying tonal category and the surface tonal variant are activated during T3 sandhi word production, but the neural substrates of...",

    "title": "Sleep patterns and crisis-related dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian war.",
    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War have profoundly affected individuals worldwide, eliciting heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and fear. This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

    "title": "Political mobilization, trauma, delusional dream themes, and nightmare distress in Hong Kong.",
    "content": "Dreams are known to be affected by large-scale traumatic events that impact society, but the literature on social movement-related trauma is inadequate. The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Anti-ELAB) was a 7-month large-scale and highly traumatic social movement in Hong Kong that began in March 2019 in opposition to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government to amend its extradition laws. Using a sample of 112 Chinese young adult (74 females, 38 males, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.83) residents in Hong Kong, this article reports an investigation into relationships between trauma (as manifested in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), dream content (dream motifs, classified according to persecution or ego ideal delusional inclinations), and nightmare distress, all recalled by participants in relation to personal experiences of the Anti-ELAB. The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay. Potential explanations for the findings as well as their implications for further research and clinical practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Anatomical connectivity-based parcellation of the human orbitofrontal cortex.",
    "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "title": "Early contingency information enhances human punishment sensitivity when punishment is frequent but not rare.",
    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

The more I read about <strong>data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling</strong>, the more I feel drawn to explore this path.</p> <p>My background is heavy on problem-solving, math, and physics, and I\u2019ve done some basic coding in Python and MATLAB for academic projects. I\u2019m now experimenting with SQL and data visualization tools, and I\u2019m considering building small projects that combine engineering concepts with data insights.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear from people who\u2019ve made a similar shift:</p> <ul> <li>What was the most valuable skill or habit you developed early on?</li> <li>Did you start in a data-related role within your original industry, or switch fields entirely?</li> <li>Any project ideas that helped you stand out when you were starting out?</li> </ul> <p>Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/osm_22\"> /u/osm_22 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ndgpwv/curious_about_moving_from_mechanical_engineering/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ndgpwv/curious_about_moving_from_mechanical_engineering/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "The slowest timescales of neural synchronization reveal the strongest influence of auditory distraction",
    "content": "IntroductionAmong all the sounds occurring at any given time, people are often interested in listening to just one. Some competing sounds are merely background noise, whereas others distract attention from target sounds and are less easily suppressed. During active listening, the central auditory pathway unmixes target and distractor sounds based on temporal differences across three orders of magnitude \u2013 from millisecond differences in acoustic temporal fine structure to slower perceptual grouping factors that stretch out to multiple seconds. We developed an approach to directly measure central auditory encoding of multiplexed target and distractor sound features in human listeners to determine which timescales are most impacted by the presence of distracting sounds.MethodsTarget sounds contained nested features along four timescales, including temporal fine structure (~500 Hz), temporal envelope (~25\u201380 Hz), envelope changes (~7 Hz), and slower changes reflecting whether target stimuli were randomly arranged or formed a repeating pattern (~0.5 Hz). Targets were presented with competing sounds that provided variable distraction levels: either a highly distracting melody or a less distracting noise. Neural synchronization to each timescale was simultaneously measured for target and distractor sounds from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during a listening task.ResultsSustained shifts from random to regular sequence arrangements were reliably perceived, yet did not evoke a pattern recognition potential, nor neural synchronization changes at any timescale. Synchronization to relatively slow changes in envelope transitions of the target sound deteriorated with the addition of more distracting sounds while synchronization to more rapid fluctuations in the fine structure or envelope were unaffected by varying distraction level. Categorizing trials by task performance revealed a conjunction of enhanced entrainment to slower temporal features in the distractor sound and reduced synchronization to the target sound on error trials.DiscussionBy designing a stimulus paradigm that leveraged the temporal processing capabilities of the auditory nervous system, we were able to simultaneously quantify multiple target and distractor sound features reproduced in the EEG. This paradigm identified synchronization processes which may prove valuable for research on clinical populations who report difficulty suppressing awareness of distracting sounds.",

    "title": "Cognitive and neuroanatomical assessment of alexia and agraphia in Japanese: implications for the European languages",
    "content": "The Japanese language has a unique writing system that consists of kanji (morphograms, derived from Chinese characters) and kana (phonograms, a simplified form of kanji representing syllables). A kanji character has two distinct ways of reading: on-reading (Chinese-style pronunciation) and kun-reading (native Japanese pronunciation). Some kanji words have irregular kun-reading called jukujikun. Furthermore, kana characters have two script forms: hiragana (cursive form) and katakana (square form), each of which is used for different purposes. Because of these features, Japanese individuals with alexia and agraphia show characteristic symptoms. Lesion-to-symptom analyses and functional imaging studies developed beginning in the 1970s have reported the following findings: (1) kanji\u2013kana dissociation in alexia/agraphia: pure alexia for kanji or kana, lexical agraphia for kanji, and phonological agraphia for kana; (2) on-kun dissociation in alexia: predominant kun-reading and jukujikun reading impairment in semantic dementia and selective on-reading impairment in the extensive posterior middle temporal gyrus lesion; and (3) allographic agraphia between hiragana and katakana.",

    "title": "Predicting attachment style from EEG data on the Flanker task",
    "content": "Bowlby's attachment theory describes the differences that people exhibit in the way they form emotional bonds with others. The dimensional measure of attachment describes it by the magnitude of anxiety and an avoidance dimension, which are currently measured using a self-report questionnaire. Recent advances in neurophysiological methods have started exploring the neural underpinnings of attachment styles. Nonetheless, a conspicuous gap remains: the underexplored realm of predictive models for predicting attachment styles based on objective physiological data. With that in mind, we have constructed a model for inferring individual attachment profiles, based solely on their brain signals recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG). For that aim, we recorded EEG data of 27 participants engaged in the Flanker task and receiving either positive or negative feedback following each trial. We then utilized the recently developed ROCKET algorithm (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) to automatically extract 20,000 time-series features from the EEG data. Next, we applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reduced the number of features to 87 individual components that were used to construct regression models predicting participants' anxiety and avoidance scores, as measured by the ECR-R questionnaire. Our results show, for the first time, that individual attachment profiles can be inferred from EEG data, allowing post hoc categorization into the four canonical attachment styles. This offers two key contributions: first, it provides an objective alternative to traditional self-report questionnaires, helping reduce subjectivity bias in attachment assessment. Second, it highlights the value of using automatically generated features over the limited set of hand-crafted features typically found in the literature.",

    "content": "IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality in all age groups. The functional disability left by TBI, is significant for the patient, family and society. Treatment and early rehabilitation are crucial to the overall level of recovery.ObjectiveTo compare the impact of extended early rehabilitation of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury on the outcome of treatment.MaterialA prospective experimental study comprised 124 patients with moderate and severe TBI, randomly divided into two groups. The patients of the experimental group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 45 min, and the patients of the control group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 30 min. The follow-up parameters were: age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and discharge, early rehabilitation interruptions, presence of tracheostomy, decubitus ulcers, nasogastric tube, diapers and urinary catheter at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and discharge from the hospital, and mortality.Results124 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 62 patients each. The male gender dominated 95 (76.6%). The average age was Me = 62.00 (IQR = 36.0) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in gender, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries and comorbidities. GCS on admission; 68 (54.8%) patients had severe, 56 (46.2%) moderate TBI, at discharge: 22 (17.7%) had severe, 11 (8.9%) moderate and 91 (73.4%) mild TBI. At discharge from the ICU, the presence of tracheostomy was (13 vs. 19), (p = 0.218), nasogastric tube (33 vs. 45), (p = 0.026) and decubitus ulcers (0 vs. 4), (p = 0.042) were less in the experimental group. At discharge from the hospital, tracheostomy (6 vs. 16), (p = 0.019), urinary catheter (38 vs. 48), (p = 0.051), diapers (29 vs. 40), (p = 0.047) were less in the experimental group. There were 5 deaths in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in early rehabilitation interruptions between groups (5 vs. 6).ConclusionExtended early TBI rehabilitation is safe, effective and contributes to a positive outcome of treatment.",

    "content": "IntroductionDyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by unilateral hemiparesis, facial asymmetry, severe epilepsy, and intellectual disability. While congenital DDMS is predominantly attributed to anterior circulation anomalies [e.g., internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) hypoplasia], posterior circulation involvement remains unreported. Here, we present the first documented case of congenital DDMS resulting from a rare combination of hypoplastic left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and ipsilateral fetal-type posterior communicating artery (FTP).Case presentationA 19-year-old male exhibited atypical DDMS manifestations: absence seizures, preserved motor function, and occipitotemporal cognitive deficits (MoCA: 20/30). Neuroimaging revealed classic DDMS features. Angiography confirmed left PCA hypoplasia with FTP persistence, while CT perfusion demonstrated chronic left PCA hypoperfusion. Lamotrigine (100\u202fmg/day) and regular cognition rehabilitative training resulted in good symptom control.ConclusionThis case identifies PCA hypoplasia with FTP as a novel DDMS etiology, challenging the MCA/ICA-centric paradigm. The \u201cposterior phenotype\u201d (absence seizures, preserved motor function, occipitotemporal cognitive deficits) expands DDMS heterogeneity. Multimodal imaging (angiography/perfusion) is diagnostic gold-standard, while personalized therapy optimizes outcomes.",

    "title": "Gender differences in brain activity underlying acupuncture sensations at LR3: a task-based fMRI study",
    "content": "BackgroundAcupuncture has been practiced in China for centuries, and LR3 (Taichong) is a key acupoint of the liver meridian that has been widely studied. Whether its central mechanism differs by sex remains unclear, because earlier work used single-sex or mixed-sex samples without stratified analysis. To close this gap, we used task-based fMRI together with the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale to compare sex differences in brain activation and thalamic functional connectivity.MethodsWe enrolled 30 men and 25 women in a block-design acupuncture task, the modular task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique was employed to investigate brain activity, and the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was utilized to assess acupuncture sensations experienced by the participants. Alterations in activated brain regions and functional connectivity were examined separately for males and females. Statistical analyses were performed to determine potential gender differences in acupuncture sensation.ResultsSignificant statistical differences were observed in the 12 acupuncture sensation scores of the MASS scale (p < 0.001). Acupuncture LR3 activated the left inferior cerebellar gyrus, right superior margin gyrus, and left posterior central gyrus in women, and activated the right superior margin gyrus, left central sulcus, and right paracentral lobule in men. Enhanced functional connectivity was also observed in the bilateral thalamus of women: the bilateral caudate nucleus, right precuneus, right cuneate fissure, and bilateral lingular gyrus were highly active. Furthermore, the right thalami also demonstrated enhanced functional connectivity with the left cuneate fissure, right posterior cingulate gyrua, and left precuneu.ConclusionThe differences in the functional connectivity of the right superior marginal gyrus and thalamus between men and women may account for the differences in acupuncture sensory processing between men and women. In addition, the right superior marginal gyrus may be a specific brain region critical for activation of the LR3 acupoint.",

    "content": "IntroductionSince an early age, we are implicitly motivated to use the direction of eye gaze of others to learn about the environment, and we orient our attention in space based on this directional signal. Similarly, we orient our attention based on the direction of arrow signs. In both cases, the mechanisms underlying attentional orienting rely on the activity of brain areas involved in endogenous attention; however, orienting by gaze direction also relies on brain areas involved in exogenous attention.Research questionsTo date, it remains unclear whether the acquisition of attentional habit, which can also guide attention in ways that are not purely endogenous or exogenous, is similar for gaze and arrow or rather differs in some important way. We aimed to assess whether learning implicit regularities implemented with exogenous, arrow, and gaze stimuli guides attention in space.MethodsUsing the Posner paradigm, we conducted a series of behavioral experiments with exogenous, arrow, and gaze cues. Unbeknownst to participants, specific regularities, namely cue predictive validity and probability cueing, were implemented through blocks (baseline, learning, testing).Results and discussionThe findings showed that predictive validity alone is not sufficient to engender habitual attention for all types of cues. However, it becomes effective when combined with probability cueing. Importantly, a learned habit with gaze cues engenders unique effects on attention compared to other cues.ConclusionSocially relevant directional signals, such as gaze, can bias spatial attention more effectively than perceptual or non-social directional stimuli.",

    "content": "Myoelectric control systems translate electromyographic signals (EMG) from muscles into movement intentions, allowing control over various interfaces, such as prosthetics, wearable devices, and robotics. However, a major challenge lies in enhancing the system's ability to generalize, personalize, and adapt to the high variability of EMG signals. Artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks, has shown promising decoding performance when applied to large datasets. However, highly parameterized deep neural networks usually require extensive user-specific data with ground truth labels to learn individual unique EMG patterns. However, the characteristics of the EMG signal can change significantly over time, even for the same user, leading to performance degradation during extended use. In this work, we propose an innovative three-stage neural network training scheme designed to progressively develop an adaptive workflow, improving and maintaining the network performance on 28 subjects over 2 days. Experiments demonstrate the importance and necessity of each stage in the proposed framework.",

    "title": "Integrated neural network framework for multi-object detection and recognition using UAV imagery",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate vehicle analysis from aerial imagery has become increasingly vital for emerging technologies and public service applications such as intelligent traffic management, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and military surveillance. However, analyzing UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep learning\u2013driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV platforms.MethodThe framework suggests using today\u2019s best neural networks that are made to solve different problems in aerial vehicle analysis. RetinexNet is used in preprocessing to make the lighting of each input frame consistent. Using HRNet for semantic segmentation allows for accurate splitting between vehicles and their surroundings. YOLOv11 provides high precision and quick vehicle detection and Deep SORT allows reliable tracking without losing track of individual cars. CSRNet are used for vehicle counting that is unaffected by obstacles or traffic jams. LSTM models capture how a car moves in time to forecast future positions. Combining DenseNet and SuperPoint embeddings that were improved with an AutoEncoder is done during feature extraction. In the end, using an attention function, Vision Transformer-based models classify vehicles seen from above. Every part of the system is developed and included to give the improved performance when the UAV is being used in real life.ResultsOur proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of vehicle analysis from UAV imagery. Our pipeline was rigorously evaluated on two famous datasets, AU-AIR and Roundabout. On the AU-AIR dataset, the system achieved a detection accuracy of 97.8%, a tracking accuracy of 96.5%, and a classification accuracy of 98.4%. Similarly, on the Roundabout dataset, it reached 96.9% detection accuracy, 94.4% tracking accuracy, and 97.7% classification accuracy. These results surpass previous benchmarks, demonstrating the system\u2019s robust performance across diverse aerial traffic scenarios. The integration of advanced models, YOLOv11 for detection, HRNet for segmentation, Deep SORT for tracking, CSRNet for counting, LSTM for trajectory prediction, and Vision Transformers for classification enables the framework to maintain high accuracy even under challenging conditions like occlusion, variable lighting, and scale variations.DiscussionThe outcomes show that the chosen deep learning system is powerful enough to deal with the challenges of aerial vehicle analysis and gives reliable and precise results in all the aforementioned tasks. Combining several advanced models ensures that the system works smoothly even when dealing with problems like people being covered up and varying sizes.",

    "content": "In deep-sea areas, the hoisting operation of offshore wind turbines is seriously affected by waves, and the secondary impact is prone to occur between the turbine and the pile foundation. To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated wave compensation system for offshore wind turbines based on a neuromorphic vision (NeuroVI) camera. The system employs a NeuroVI camera to achieve non-contact, high-precision, and low-latency displacement detection of hydraulic cylinders, overcoming the limitations of traditional magnetostrictive displacement sensors, which exhibit slow response and susceptibility to interference in harsh marine conditions. A dynamic simulation model was developed using AMESim-Simulink co-simulation to analyze the compensation performance of the NeuroVI-based system under step and sinusoidal wave disturbances. Comparative results demonstrate that the NeuroVI feedback system achieves faster response times and superior stability over conventional sensors. Laboratory-scale model tests and real-world application in the installation of a 5.2\u202fMW offshore wind turbine validated the system\u2019s feasibility and robustness, enabling real-time collaborative control of turbine and cylinder displacement to effectively mitigate multi-impact risks. This research provides an innovative approach for deploying neural perception technology in complex marine scenarios and advances the development of neuro-robotic systems in ocean engineering.",

    "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

Despite phenotypic rescue in animal deletion models, clinical trials in humans have been unsuccessful, likely due to the heterogeneous nature of FXS. To uncover the basis of individual- and subgroup-level variation driving treatment failures, we propose to test and modulate thalamocortical drive as a novel \u201cbottom-up\u201d neural probe to understand the mechanics of FXS-relevant circuits. Our study employs trial-level EEG analyses (neurodynamics) to detect fine-grained differences in brain activity using sensory and statistical learning paradigms in children with FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typically developing controls. Parallel analysis in the FXS knockout mouse model will clarify its relevance to human FXS subgroups. In a randomized crossover study, we will evaluate the efficacy of closed-loop auditory entrainment, indexed on individual neurodynamic measures, aiming to normalize neural responses and enhance statistical learning performance. We anticipate this approach will yield opportunities to identify more effective early interventions that alter the trajectory of intellectual development in FXS.",

    "content": "Orexin (Orx) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area are central to regulating the sleep-wake cycle and coordinating memory consolidation and forgetting through dynamic homeostatic mechanisms. This review systematically examines the functional characteristics of these two neural systems and their interactions: first, MCH neurons facilitate the transition from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at night via a dual regulatory mechanism and regulate the active forgetting of memories via hippocampal neural circuits; second, orexin neurons maintain homeostasis in daytime wakefulness via monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways, while acting as stabilizers during REM sleep stages and enhance memory encoding through amygdala-prefrontal projections. Notably, these two systems show unique antagonistic synergetic dual-mode regulation under the framework of circadian rhythm: orexin neurons maintain the steady state of sleep-wake cycle by promoting wakefulness and inhibiting REM sleep and MCH neurons form dynamic antagonism by inducing sleep and enhancing REM sleep in the sleep-wake dimension, whereas a coordinated balance of information filtering is achieved in the memory regulation dimension through phasic encoding of hippocampal theta rhythms. Clinically, orexin receptor agonists demonstrate therapeutic potential in narcolepsy management, whereas MCH receptor antagonists show promise for memory reconsolidation in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This review emphasizes the dynamic interplay and reciprocal inhibition between orexin and MCH neurons that form a pivotal bidirectional network framework for dissecting neuropsychiatric comorbidities, wherein pathway dysregulation may propagate from circadian disruption to mnemonic dysfunction, which provides a new theoretical framework for developing intervention strategies across symptom dimensions.",

    "title": "[ANNOUNCEMENT] pychub: A new way to ship your Python wheels + deps + extras",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey fellow deveopers! </p> <p>I built a packaging tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/Steve973/pychub\"><strong>pychub</strong></a> that might fill a weird little gap you didn\u2019t know you had. It came out of me needing a clean way to distribute Python wheels <em>with</em> all of their dependencies and optional extras, but <em>without</em> having to freeze them into platform-specific binaries like PyInstaller does. And if you want to just install everything into your own current environment? That's what I wanted, too.</p> <h1>So what is it?</h1> <p><strong>pychub</strong> takes your wheel, resolves and downloads its dependencies, and wraps everything into a single executable <code>.chub</code> file. That file can then be shipped/copied anywhere, and then run directly like this:</p> <pre><code>python yourtool.chub </code></pre> <p>It installs into the current environment (or a venv, or a conda env, your call), and can even run an entrypoint function or console script <em>right after</em> install.</p> <p>No network calls. No pip. No virtualenv setup. Just <code>python tool.chub</code> and go.</p> <h1>Why I built it:</h1> <p>Most of the Python packaging tools out there either:</p> <ul> <li>Freeze the whole thing into a binary (PyInstaller, PyOxidizer) \u2014 which is great, until you hit platform issues or need to debug something. Or you just want to do something different than that.</li> <li>Just stop at building a wheel and leave it up to you (or your users) to figure out installation, dependencies, and environment prep.</li> </ul> <p>I wanted something in between: still using the host Python interpreter (so it stays light and portable), but with everything pre-downloaded and reproducible.</p> <h1>What it can bundle:</h1> <ul> <li>Your main wheel</li> <li>Any number of additional wheels</li> <li>All their dependencies (downloaded and stored locally)</li> <li>Optional include files (configs, docs, whatever)</li> <li>Pre-install and post-install scripts (shell, Python, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>And it\u2019s 100% reproducible, so that the archive installs the exact same versions every time, no network access needed.</p> <h1>Build tool integration:</h1> <p>If you're using <strong>Poetry</strong>, <strong>Hatch</strong>, or <strong>PDM</strong>, I\u2019ve released plugins for all three:</p> <ul> <li>Just add the plugin to your <code>pyproject.toml</code></li> <li>Specify your build details (main wheel, includes, scripts, etc.)</li> <li>Run your normal build command and you\u2019ll get a <code>.chub</code> alongside your <code>.whl</code></li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s one of the easiest ways to ship Python tools that <em>just work,</em> whether you're distributing internally, packaging for air-gapped environments, or dropping into Docker builder stages.</p> <p>Plugins repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins\">https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins</a></p> <h1>Why not just use some other bundling/packaging tool?</h1> <p>Well, depending on your needs, maybe you should! I don\u2019t think pychub replaces everything. It just solves a different problem.</p> <p>If you want sealed apps with bundled runtimes, use PEX or PyOxidizer.<br /> If you're distributing scripts, zipapp is great.<br /> But if you want a <strong>wheel-based</strong>, network-free, single-file installer that works on any Python 3.9+ environment, then pychub might be the right tool.</p> <p>Full comparison table along with everything else:<br /> \ud83d\udcd8 <a href=\"https://github.com/Steve973/pychub#why-not-just-use-insert-favorite-tool-name-here\">README on GitHub</a></p> <p>That\u2019s it. I built it because I needed it to include plugins for a platform that I am building. If it helps you too, even better. I will be actively supporting this, and if you would like to take it for a spin and see if you like it, I'd be honored to hear your feedback. If you want a feature added, etc, please let me know.<br /> Issues, suggestions, and PRs are all welcome.</p> <p>Thanks for your time and interest!</p> <p>Steve</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Steve91973\"> /u/Steve91973 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nds31l/announcement_pychub_a_new_way_to_ship_your_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nds31l/announcement_pychub_a_new_way_to_ship_your_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Stuttering: the nature of the speech disruptions\u2014a multimodal study of articulation and phonation",
    "content": "Stuttering is a disorder characterized by transient disruptions in speech motor production. This article is focused on the characteristics of stuttering and the immediate vocal tract mechanisms resulting in stuttered speech disruptions. A range of observations from an initial series of studies on the motor characteristics of stuttering events in adults is presented, combined with a narrative review of published data regarding objective and subjective aspects of instances of stuttering. The aims of the empirical studies were to develop methods for data collection and analysis, as well as collecting and analyzing initial data. The analysis was exploratory and qualitative, focusing on physiological data from individual stuttering events in order to understand their underlying dynamics and mechanisms. As a frame of reference, the motor characteristics and subjective experiences of stuttering were compared with the characteristics of known movement disorders, such as dystonia, motor blocks (e.g., freezing of gait), and tremor. The results show that stuttering events can include both negative and positive motor signs. It is proposed that stuttered disruptions can arise both as a result of insufficient muscular activation and as a result of interfering dysfunctional muscular activity. It is further suggested that the characteristics of stuttering to a very high degree correspond to motor block symptoms, indicating a transient inability to execute the next motor program in the speech sequence. Elements of dystonia may account for some symptoms. Volitional attempts to break fixed postures may increase the muscular tension and result in tremor, similar to dystonic tremor. The severity of the tremor is strongly correlated with the severity of physical concomitants. Tremor may be silent, as well as resulting in rapid audible repetitions if the vocal tract is opened and closed at the tremor frequency. Silent periods in stuttering can result from total closure of the airway at the level of the larynx, the tongue, or the lips. However, silent periods can also result from excessive opening of the vocal folds, leading to silent airflow and an inability to phonate. It is proposed that the motor blocks stem from transient decoupling between cortical and basal ganglia networks.",

    "content": "ObjectiveNon-invasive Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces provide accurate classification of hand movement lateralization. However, distinguishing activation patterns of individual fingers within the same hand remains challenging due to their overlapping representations in the motor cortex. Here, we validated a compact convolutional neural network for fast and reliable decoding of finger movements from non-invasive magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings.ApproachWe recorded healthy participants in MEG performing a serial reaction time task (SRTT), with buttons pressed by left and right index and middle fingers. We devised classifiers to identify left vs. right hand movements and among four finger movements using a recently proposed decoding approach, Linear Finite Impulse Response Convolutional Neural Network (LF-CNN). We also compared LF-CNN to existing deep learning architectures such as EEGNet, FBCSP-ShallowNet, and VGG19.ResultsSequence learning was reflected by a decrease in reaction times during SRTT performance. Movement laterality was decoded with an accuracy superior to 95% by all approaches, while for individual finger movement, decoding was in the 80\u201385% range. LF-CNN stood out for (1) its low computational time and (2) its interpretability in both spatial and spectral domains, allowing to examine neurophysiological patterns reflecting task-related motor cortex activity.SignificanceWe demonstrated the feasibility of finger movement decoding with a tailored Convolutional Neural Network. The performance of our approach was comparable to complex deep learning architectures, while providing faster and interpretable outcome. This algorithmic strategy holds high potential for the investigation of the mechanisms underlying non-invasive neurophysiological recordings in cognitive neuroscience.",

    "content": "IntroductionNon-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, particularly repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have shown potential in stroke rehabilitation. However, systematic reviews often reach conflicting conclusions, highlighting the need for an umbrella review.ObjectiveTo synthesize, based on the principal domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, the best available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of NIBS for improving motor impairment and disability after stroke.MethodsWe conducted an umbrella review (PROSPERO: CRD42021239577) that included meta-analyses of controlled trials investigating NIBS effects in stroke survivors, retrieved from PubMed/MEDLINE from February 2020 to July 2025. Methodological quality was appraised using AMSTAR-2 and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Outcomes were mapped to ICF body structure/function and activity domains.ResultsFifty-six studies were included (2\u201348 primary trials each; 54\u20131,654 participants per meta-analysis). All included studies evaluated only rTMS and tDCS; no meta-analyses of other NIBS modalities met inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was high or moderate in 85.7% of the meta-analyses. Certainty of evidence was low or very low for 14/50 studies; only one rTMS review provided moderate-certainty evidence for activities of daily living. rTMS showed improvement in activities of daily living (ADL; SMD = \u22120.82, 95% CI \u22121.05 to \u22120.59), upper-limb motor impairment (SMD = \u22120.32, 95% CI \u22120.55 to \u22120.09) and variable effects on mobility from small (SMD = \u22120.35, 95% CI \u22120.45 to \u22120.24) to large (SMD = \u22120.97, 95% CI \u22121.28 to \u22120.66). tDCS was supported by very-low-certainty evidence: small effects were found for motor impairment (SMD = \u22120.22, 95 % CI \u22120.32 to \u22120.12) and upper-limb activity (SMD = \u22120.31, 95% CI \u22120.55 to \u22120.01), while a much smaller subset of trials suggested a large effect (SMD = \u22121.54, 95% CI \u22122.78 to \u22120.29). Effects on ADL and mobility with tDCS were inconsistent and generally non-significant.ConclusionrTMS was more frequently associated with moderate to large effect sizes for body structure/function outcomes, particularly general neurological function. In contrast, tDCS demonstrated small effects on motor recovery, though evidence certainty was very low due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and protocol variability. Within the activity domain, NIBS showed modest effects, with rTMS showing more consistent benefits for ADL. tDCS effects were generally limited and supported by low to very low certainty of evidence.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42021239577.",

    "title": "Towards a closed loop retinal prosthesis: measuring electrically evoked retinal responses using large electrodes",
    "content": "Objective. Sensory prostheses use arrays of electrodes to stimulate neural tissue and restore a sense of vision or hearing. At perceptible levels of stimulation, the current from each electrode spreads and causes overlapping regions of neural activation. This lack of specificity results in perceptual deficits. Methods to overcome this reduced specificity, such as a closed loop stimulation approach require measurement of the neural response to stimulation. This investigation tests the possibility of using the large stimulating electrodes such as those required by some subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal implants to measure the neural response to stimulation, an approach similar to Evoked Compound Action Potentials measurements used in cochlear implants. Approach. Ex vivo tissue samples from Long Evans rats with healthy retinas and Royal College of Surgeon rats with retinal degeneration were used to investigate both stimulating and recording from electrodes of the same array. A hexagonal array was used with 20 platinum electrodes with 500 \u03bcm diameter and 700 \u03bcm pitch. Post-stimulus voltage decay was reduced with appropriate tuning of a triphasic stimulation pulse and in post-analysis with a high-pass filter. A method using alternating polarities of biphasic pulses was also trialed. A cocktail of synaptic and ion channel blockers was used to block all neural response including action potentials and thus confirm the biological origin of the signal. Main Results. It was found that a neural signal was observable on electrode that were sufficiently distant from the stimulating electrodes. The signal appeared to be due to direct activation of ganglion cells or possibly mediated via inner retinal neurons. Significance. This result confirms that recording usable neural signals from large electrodes is possible, which is an essential step in implementing a closed loop stimulation strategy for a subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis.",

    "title": "Deep brain stimulation-induced local evoked potentials outperform spectral features in spatial and clinical STN mapping",
    "content": "Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Yet, optimizing lead placement and stimulation programming remains challenging. Current techniques rely on imaging and intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MER), while programming relies on trial-and-error clinical testing, which can be time-consuming. DBS-induced local evoked potentials (DLEP), also known as evoked resonant neural activity, have emerged as a potential alternative electrophysiological marker for mapping. However, direct comparisons with traditional spectral features, such as beta-band, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and aperiodic component are lacking. Approach. We evaluated DLEP across 39 STN DBS leads in 31 subjects with PD undergoing DBS surgery, using both a single-pulse and high-frequency (HF) burst stimulation paradigms. We developed a novel artifact-removal method to enable monopolar DLEP recovery, including estimating the DLEP amplitudes at stimulated contacts, further enhancing spatial sampling of DLEP. We evaluated spectral features and DLEP in respect to imaging-based and MER-based localization, and its predictive power for post-operative programming. Main results. DLEP showed great spatial consistency, maximizing within STN with 100% accuracy for single-pulse and 84.62% for burst stimulation, surpassing spectral measures including beta (89.74%) and HFO (82.05%). DLEP better correlated with clinical outcomes (single-pulses \u03c1 = \u22120.33, HF bursts \u03c1 = \u22120.26), than spectral measures (beta \u03c1 = \u22120.25, HFO \u03c1 = 0.05). Furthermore, single-pulses at low-frequencies are sufficient for DLEP-based mapping. Significance. We show how DLEP provide higher STN-spatial specificity and correlation with postoperative programming compared to spectral features. To support clinical translation of DLEP, we developed two methods aimed to recover artifact-free DLEP and estimating DLEP amplitudes at stimulating contacts. DLEP appear distinct from beta and HFO activity, yet strongly tied to aperiodic spectral components, suggesting that DLEP amplitude reflects underlying STN excitability. This study highlights that DLEP are a robust and clinically valuable marker for DBS targeting and programming.",

    "title": "Refining signal localization: a transcranial magnetic stimulation motor mapping approach to functional near-infrared spectroscopy",
    "content": "Objective. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising brain imaging tool due to its cost-effectiveness and balance between spatial and temporal resolution. However, its reliance on the 10-20 EEG coordinate system for probe placement introduces potential inaccuracies in cortical localization. Despite concerns regarding its spatial precision, the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with fNIRS for validating signal localization has not been systematically explored. This study aimed to demonstrate the interindividual variability in hand motor representations and how it influences the precision of fNIRS recordings during motor tasks. Approach. Neuronavigated TMS was employed on 18 neurotypical adults to map the motor representations of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and fourth dorsal interosseous (4DI) muscles. Center-of-gravity (CoG) coordinates from TMS-evoked motor maps were compared with fNIRS channel locations, including the theoretical hand channel defined by the 10-20 EEG system. FNIRS signals were recorded during a hand-grasp motor task, and the subject-specific hand channel was determined by identifying the fNIRS channel closest to the individual\u2019s TMS CoG. Main Results. TMS motor mapping revealed substantial interindividual variability, with 56% of participants demonstrating deviations from the theoretical fNIRS hand channel. TMS motor maps showed that the FDI and 4DI representations were closely positioned, with the 4DI representation slightly anterior to the FDI (p = 0.022). Analysis of fNIRS signals indicated that subject-specific hand channels exhibited significantly higher hemodynamic response amplitudes compared to the theoretical hand channel (p = 0.0004), suggesting enhanced signal sensitivity when using individualized cortical mapping. Additionally, fNIRS signal variance was significantly higher in the theoretical channel, indicating greater signal variability and lower signal robustness. Significance. These findings highlight the limitations of rigidly applying the 10-20 EEG system for spatial localization in fNIRS-based motor studies and show the benefits of integrating TMS-derived cortical mapping for improved signal accuracy and robustness.",

    "content": "Objective. The precise mapping of speech-related functions is crucial for successful neurosurgical interventions in epilepsy and brain tumor cases. Traditional methods like electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) are effective but carry a significant risk of inducing seizures. Methods. To address this, we have prepared a comprehensive ESM\u2009+\u2009electrocorticographic mapping (ECM) dataset from 14 patients with chronically implanted stereo-EEG electrodes. Then we explored several compact machine learning (ML) approaches to convert the ECM signals to the ground truth derived from the risky ESM procedure. Both procedures involved the standard picture naming task. As features, we used gamma-band power within successive temporal windows in the data averaged with respect to picture and voice onsets. We focused on a range of classifiers, including XGBoost, linear support vector classification (SVC), regularized logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, multi-Layer perceptron, AdaBoost and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers and equipped them with confidence interval estimates, crucial in a real-life application. We validated the ML approaches using a leave-one-patient-out procedure and computed ROC and Precision\u2013Recall curves for various feature combinations. Results. For linear SVC we achieved ROC-AUC and PR-AUC scores of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, which effectively distinguishes speech-related from non-related iEEG channels. We have also observed that the use of information on the voice onset moment notably improved the classification accuracy. Significance. We have for the first time rigorously compared the ECM and ESM results and mimicked a real-life use of the ECM technology. We have also provided public access to the comprehensive ECM+ESM dataset to pave the road towards safer and more reliable eloquent cortex mapping procedures.",

    "content": "Objective. Human\u2013robot collaboration in lower-limb rehabilitation devices imposes stringent requirements on both the recognition accuracy of motion intention and real-time responsiveness. The precise recognition of lower limb motion based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has always been a primary focus of study. However, achieving low-delay recognition in lower limb continuous motion while maintaining accuracy remains a challenge, which is key to unlocking the full potential for the effective deployment and widespread application of robots. Approach. An innovative recognition method in lower limb continuous motion was presented in this paper, which investigated the instantaneous recognition network (IRN) and continuous recognition (CR) model. Main results. The comparative analysis revealed that by utilizing an optimal length of 210 for the onset-window sEMG data, the proposed IRN could substantially reduce the time delay from 300 ms/350 ms to 60 ms at the methodological level. The implementation of the class-balanced method enhanced motion recognition accuracy by an additional 4.83% within the onset window. The CR model was validated across seven scenarios, comprehensively covering all potential situations in daily continuous movements, and achieved an average accuracy of 96.31%. Significance. This study demonstrates the potential of the proposed instantaneous recognition method to enhance performance in lower limb continuous motion, providing an innovative approach for research on human\u2013robot synchronization.",

    "title": "Extracting robust single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials for non-invasive brain computer interfaces",
    "content": "Objective. Reliable extraction of single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) is essential for developing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications to support rehabilitation after brain injury. For real-time feedback, these responses must be extracted prospectively on every trial, with minimal post-processing and artifact correction. However, noninvasive SEPs elicited by electrical stimulation at recommended parameter settings (0.1\u20130.2 msec pulse width, stimulation at or below motor threshold, 2\u20135 Hz frequency) are typically small and variable, often requiring averaging across multiple trials or extensive processing. Here, we describe and evaluate ways to optimize the stimulation setup to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of noninvasive single-trial SEPs, enabling more reliable extraction. Approach. SEPs were recorded with scalp electroencephalography in tibial nerve stimulation in thirteen healthy people, and two people with CNS injuries. Three stimulation frequencies (lower than recommended: 0.2 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz) with a pulse width longer than recommended (1 msec), at a stimulation intensity based on H-reflex and M-wave at Soleus muscle were evaluated. Detectability of single-trial SEPs relative to background noise was tested offline and in a pseudo-online analysis, followed by a real-time demonstration. Mainresults. SEP N70 was observed predominantly at the central scalp regions. Online decoding performance was significantly higher with Laplacian filter. Generalization performance showed an expected degradation, at all frequencies, with an average decrease of 5.9% (multivariate) and 6.5% (univariate), with an AUC score ranging from 0.78\u20130.90. The difference across stimulation frequencies was not significant. In individuals with injuries, AUC of 0.86 (incomplete spinal cord injury) and 0.81 (stroke) was feasible. Real-time demonstration showed SEP detection with AUC of 0.89. Significance. This study describes and evaluates a system for extracting single-trial SEPs in real-time, suitable for a BCI-based operant conditioning. It enhances SNR of individual SEPs by alternate electrical stimulation parameters, dry headset, and optimized signal processing.",

    "title": "Unveiling functional heterogeneity in anatomical functional areas: a framework for fine-grained functional connectivity analysis of wide-field calcium imaging data",
    "content": "Objective. Conventional functional connectivity (FC) analysis of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data relies on the assumption of homogeneity within predefined anatomical functional areas (FAs), where the signal averaged within each FA serves as the foundation for inter-FA connectivity modeling. However, accumulating evidence suggested significant intra-FA functional heterogeneity with functionally distinct subregions. This study aims to systematically examine the existence of the heterogeneity and the consequences of violating the homogeneity assumption on the FC analysis. Approach. We propose a three-step approach: (1) The spatiotemporal clustering of pixels with similar activity dynamics into functional parcels (FPs). (2) Classifying FPs according to their cortex-wide connectivity profiles into four categories: cross-hemispheric (CH), unihemispheric (UH), cross-modal (CM) and unimodal (UM). (3) Gauging the consequences and utility of above analysis. Main results. Analysis of adult mice WFCI data (n = 6) shows that pixels can be reliably clustered into FPs, and that FPs fall into different categories and form distinct subregions, unveiling the functional heterogeneity within each FA. Crucially, fine-grained FC analysis for different categories of subregions uncovered significant differences compared to the results from the conventional method. Application of the analysis to longitudinal WFCI data on mouse brain development (n = 17) demonstrates increases in CM and CH subregions and decreases in UM and UH subregions over time, in line with expectations based on prior research into neurodevelopment and network reorganization. Significance. The present study develops a fine-grained FC analysis framework, leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution of WFCI to more precisely characterize large-scale cortical network dynamics. The observed differences between FCs derived using the proposed framework and those from conventional methods highlight the need for caution regarding the functional homogeneity assumption in conventional FC analysis. Furthermore, the developmental regularities revealed in longitudinal mouse brain data demonstrate the utility of fine-grained FC analysis.",

    "content": "Objectives. Reconstruction of visual perception from brain signals has emerged as a promising research topic. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a kind of high-quality intracranial signal with good spatiotemporal resolution that offers some new opportunities. However, according to our knowledge, there are no studies to reconstruct the perceived images from human ECoG signals at present. Approach. We have conducted the pioneering work and developed a novel pipeline that integrates Talairach coordinate alignment masked autoencoders (TA-MAE) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our approach exploits the spatiotemporal dynamics of human ECoG signals, enabling the restoration of details in high-resolution. Main results. Experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of appearance, structure, signal-noise ratio, and semantic consistency. Additionally, our study indicated that unsupervised learning-based signal reconstruction outperforms manually annotated label-guided feature recognition in capturing the low-dimensional representation of brain signals, potentially facilitating the exploration of vision\u2019s intrinsic mechanisms. Significance. These results highlight the advantages of unsupervised decoding and provide a generalizable framework for human ECoG-based visual reconstruction.",

    "title": "Most Performant Python Compilers/Transpilers in 2025",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Today I find myself in the unfortunate position to create a program that must compile arbitrary python code :( For the use case I am facing now performance is everything, and luckily the target OS for the executable file will only be linux. The compiled codes will be standalone local computational tools without any frills (no guis, no i|o or r|w operations, no system access, and no backend or configuration needs to pull in). Python code is &gt;=3.8 and can pull in external libraries (eg: numpy). However, the codes may be multithreaded/multiprocessed and any static type-like behavior is not guaranteed.</p> <p>Historically I have used tools like pyinstaller, py2exe, py2app, which work robustly, but create stand alone executable files that are often pretty slow. I have been looking at a host of transpilers instead, eg: <a href=\"https://github.com/dbohdan/compilers-targeting-c?tab=readme-ov-file\">https://github.com/dbohdan/compilers-targeting-c?tab=readme-ov-file</a>, and am somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of choices therein. Going through stackoverflow naturally recovered a lot of great recommendations that were go-to's 10-20 years ago, but do not have much promise for recent python versions. Currently I am considering:<br /> wax <a href=\"https://github.com/LingDong-/wax\">https://github.com/LingDong-/wax</a> ,<br /> 11l-lang <a href=\"https://11l-lang.org/transpiler/\">https://11l-lang.org/transpiler/</a>,<br /> nuitka <a href=\"https://nuitka.net/\">https://nuitka.net/</a>,<br /> prometeo <a href=\"https://github.com/zanellia/prometeo\">https://github.com/zanellia/prometeo</a>,<br /> pytran <a href=\"https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>,<br /> rpython <a href=\"https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>,<br /> or py14 <a href=\"https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/py14\">https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/py14</a>.<br /> However, this is a lot to consider without rigorously testing all of them out. Does anyone on this sub have experience in modern Transpilers or other techniques for compiling numerical python codes for linux? If so, can you share any tools, techniques, or general guidance? Thank you!</p> <p>Edit for clarification:<br /> This will be placed in a user facing application wherein users can upload their tools to be autonomously deployed in a on demand/dynamic runtime basis. Since we cannot know all the codes that users are uploading, a lot of the traditional and well defined methods are not possible. We are including C, C++, Rust, Fortran, Go, and Cobol compilers to support these languages, but seeking a similar solution for python.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wbcm\"> /u/wbcm </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ncy8av/most_performant_python_compilerstranspilers_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ncy8av/most_performant_python_compilerstranspilers_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",
