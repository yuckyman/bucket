    "title": "The CHAT System: A Wearable Haptic System for Facilitating Tactile Communication",
    "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

    "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

    "title": "Closed-Loop Manual Control With Tactile or Visual Feedback Under Wireless Link Impairments",
    "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

    "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

    "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

    "content": "Humans operating in dynamic environments with limited visibility are susceptible to collisions with moving objects, occupational hazards, and/or other agents, which can result in personal injuries or fatalities. Most existing research has focused on using vibrotactile cues to address this challenge. In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach that utilizes variable impedance on an active exoskeleton to guide humans away from hazards and towards safe areas. This framework combines artificial potential fields with current impedance-based theories of exoskeleton control to provide a comprehensive navigational system that is intuitive for human operators. First, we present the mathematical framework to encode information about the locations of obstacles and the safest direction in which to move. Next, we optimize controller parameters in a series of human-subject experiments. Finally, we evaluate the framework in virtual reality on a set of randomly generated obstacle fields in environments where vision is either fully or partially occluded. Our results suggest that the exoskeleton provides significant separation from obstacles and reduced collisions compared to vision alone in conditions where visibility was limited to less than 1.3 m. Our work demonstrates that force-feedback in parallel with a human can improve overall navigation ability in low visibility conditions.",

    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Optimization of Perceived Realism of Multi-Modal Haptic Rendering Under Conflicting Sensory Cues",
    "content": "During haptic rendering, a visual display and a haptic interface are commonly utilized together to elicit multi-sensory perception of a virtual object, through a combination and integration of force-related and movement-related cues. In this study, we explore visual-haptic cue integration during multi-modal haptic rendering under conflicting cues and propose a systematic means to determine the optimal visual scaling for haptic manipulation that maximizes the perceived realism of spring rendering for a given haptic interface. We show that the parameters affecting visual-haptic congruency can be effectively optimized through a qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization to ensure a consistently high rating of perceived realism. Accordingly, the multi-modal perception of users can be successfully enhanced by solely modulating the visual feedback without altering the haptic feedback, to make virtual environments feel stiffer or more compliant, significantly extending the range of perceived stiffness levels for a haptic interface. We extend our results to a group of individuals to capture the multi-dimensional psychometric field that characterizes the cumulative effect of feedback modalities utilized during sensory cue integration under conflicts. Our results not only provide reliable estimates of just noticeable difference thresholds for stiffness with and without visual scaling but also capture all the prominent features of sensory cue integration, indicating weights that are proportional to the congruency level of manipulated visual signals. Overall, preference-based HiL optimization excels as a systematic and efficient method of studying multi-modal perception under conflicts.",

    "content": "The growing need for human-machine interfaces (HMIs) underscores the importance of sensory feedback, with electrical stimulation offering efficient interaction in various applications. While its sensory effects are extensively studied, investigations into the reaction time (RT) following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate how stimulation parameters influence RT. We examined RT and RT variability among twenty healthy participants aged 21 to 61 years. Participants underwent 16 stimulation patterns (10 repetitions per pattern) with combinations of four pulse frequencies (4, 26, 48, 70 Hz) and four pulse amplitudes (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times of sensory threshold) on four skin locations in the lower leg above peroneal nerve, tibial nerve, tibialis anterior muscle, and a lateral shank control site. RT was assessed as participants dorsiflexed their foot in response to electrical stimulation. Results revealed that both RT and its variability decreased as pulse frequency and amplitude increased, and there was an interaction effect between pulse frequency and amplitude. However, no significant difference was found in RT across stimulation locations. These findings demonstrate how stimulation parameters affect the speed and efficiency of communication between the user and the stimulator, showing promises for augmenting real-time feedback HMIs.",

    "content": "Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons show opposite pairings of anatomy and output across caloric states. In mice, 24-h caloric restriction (CR) increases AgRP-to-paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) fiber density without increasing stimulation-evoked feeding, whereas 5-day high-fat diet (HFD) reduces fiber density yet increases stimulation-evoked feeding, including during PVH terminal stimulation. PVH Bdnf rises acutely under both challenges and remains elevated with sustained HFD. Receptor expression shifts with state: in AgRP neurons, CR increases TrkB transcripts, whereas HFD increases p75NTR transcripts. AgRP-specific deletions define directional roles: TrkB loss reduces AgRP-to-PVH fiber density and yields larger stimulation-evoked feeding, whereas p75NTR loss increases fiber density and limits responses. Thus, a TrkB/p75NTR balance in AgRP neurons provides rheostat-like control over the relationship between circuit structure and stimulation-evoked feeding across caloric states, identifying TrkB and p75NTR as tractable molecular handles for probing state-dependent control of AgRP circuit output.",

    "title": "Reducing ventral hippocampal CA1/subiculum hyperexcitability restores social memory and alleviates anxiety-related behavior in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy",
    "content": "Background: Interictal cognitive and affective comorbidities in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often remain refractory to seizure-directed therapies. We tested the causal role of ventral hippocampal CA1/subiculum (vCA1/Sub) hyperexcitability in social memory failure and anxiety-related behavior, and whether normalizing principal-cell excitability restores function. Methods: In pilocarpine-treated mice we combined blinded behavioral assays (social approach/discrimination, open field, olfaction), whole-cell recordings from mCherry-labeled vCA1/Sub principal neurons, alveus stimulation to assay synaptic inhibition/excitation, immunohistochemistry for parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) interneurons, and chemogenetic control of excitability (hM3Dq in controls; hM4Di and KORD in epileptic mice). Missing behavioral outcomes were handled by multiple imputation with bootstrapping; pooled analyses used ANOVA, mixed-effects models, and logistic regression. Results: Epileptic mice showed preserved social approach but impaired social discrimination, with intact detection of social odors. Regular-spiking and bursting vCA1/Sub neurons exhibited depolarized resting membrane potential and reduced synaptically driven hyperpolarizations during alveus stimulation, indicating disinhibition; PV and SST interneuron densities were reduced in stratum oriens. Chemogenetic manipulation bidirectionally tuned excitability: bath CNO depolarized hM3Dq-expressing cells, whereas it hyperpolarized hM4Di-expressing cells by ~5 mV and decreased current-evoked spiking. In vivo, inhibiting vCA1/Sub principal cells (hM4Di or KORD activation) increased the probability of successful social discrimination in epileptic mice without altering investigation time; neither CNO nor salvinorin B affected unDREADDed animals. In the open field, epileptic mice displayed reduced center preference and high-velocity bouts; vCA1/Sub inhibition normalized center preference and movement toward control values. Center preference predicted social discrimination in DREADDed epileptic mice, linking anxiety-related behavior to vCA1/Sub excitability. Conclusions: vCA1/Sub hyperexcitability drives interictal social memory and anxiety-related deficits in chronic TLE. Reducing principal-cell excitability restores behavior despite interneuron loss, supporting a model in which ventral hippocampal output can be retuned to rescue cognition. These results nominate neuromodulation of vCA1/Sub as a strategy to improve quality of life in epilepsy.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "content": "In deep-sea areas, the hoisting operation of offshore wind turbines is seriously affected by waves, and the secondary impact is prone to occur between the turbine and the pile foundation. To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated wave compensation system for offshore wind turbines based on a neuromorphic vision (NeuroVI) camera. The system employs a NeuroVI camera to achieve non-contact, high-precision, and low-latency displacement detection of hydraulic cylinders, overcoming the limitations of traditional magnetostrictive displacement sensors, which exhibit slow response and susceptibility to interference in harsh marine conditions. A dynamic simulation model was developed using AMESim-Simulink co-simulation to analyze the compensation performance of the NeuroVI-based system under step and sinusoidal wave disturbances. Comparative results demonstrate that the NeuroVI feedback system achieves faster response times and superior stability over conventional sensors. Laboratory-scale model tests and real-world application in the installation of a 5.2\u202fMW offshore wind turbine validated the system\u2019s feasibility and robustness, enabling real-time collaborative control of turbine and cylinder displacement to effectively mitigate multi-impact risks. This research provides an innovative approach for deploying neural perception technology in complex marine scenarios and advances the development of neuro-robotic systems in ocean engineering.",

    "title": "Integrated neural network framework for multi-object detection and recognition using UAV imagery",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate vehicle analysis from aerial imagery has become increasingly vital for emerging technologies and public service applications such as intelligent traffic management, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and military surveillance. However, analyzing UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep learning\u2013driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV platforms.MethodThe framework suggests using today\u2019s best neural networks that are made to solve different problems in aerial vehicle analysis. RetinexNet is used in preprocessing to make the lighting of each input frame consistent. Using HRNet for semantic segmentation allows for accurate splitting between vehicles and their surroundings. YOLOv11 provides high precision and quick vehicle detection and Deep SORT allows reliable tracking without losing track of individual cars. CSRNet are used for vehicle counting that is unaffected by obstacles or traffic jams. LSTM models capture how a car moves in time to forecast future positions. Combining DenseNet and SuperPoint embeddings that were improved with an AutoEncoder is done during feature extraction. In the end, using an attention function, Vision Transformer-based models classify vehicles seen from above. Every part of the system is developed and included to give the improved performance when the UAV is being used in real life.ResultsOur proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of vehicle analysis from UAV imagery. Our pipeline was rigorously evaluated on two famous datasets, AU-AIR and Roundabout. On the AU-AIR dataset, the system achieved a detection accuracy of 97.8%, a tracking accuracy of 96.5%, and a classification accuracy of 98.4%. Similarly, on the Roundabout dataset, it reached 96.9% detection accuracy, 94.4% tracking accuracy, and 97.7% classification accuracy. These results surpass previous benchmarks, demonstrating the system\u2019s robust performance across diverse aerial traffic scenarios. The integration of advanced models, YOLOv11 for detection, HRNet for segmentation, Deep SORT for tracking, CSRNet for counting, LSTM for trajectory prediction, and Vision Transformers for classification enables the framework to maintain high accuracy even under challenging conditions like occlusion, variable lighting, and scale variations.DiscussionThe outcomes show that the chosen deep learning system is powerful enough to deal with the challenges of aerial vehicle analysis and gives reliable and precise results in all the aforementioned tasks. Combining several advanced models ensures that the system works smoothly even when dealing with problems like people being covered up and varying sizes.",

    "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

The Residual Convolutional Block Attention Module (RCBAM) serves as the teacher network to extract high-dimensional spatial features via residual structures and channel\u2013spatial attention. The student network adopts a Temporal Convolutional Network\u2013LSTM (TCN\u2013LSTM) design, integrating dilated causal convolutions and two LSTM layers for efficient temporal modeling. Historical ADS-B trajectory data from Zhuhai Jinwan Airport are preprocessed using cubic spline interpolation and a uniform-step sliding window to ensure data alignment and temporal consistency. In the distillation process, soft labels from the teacher and hard labels from actual observations jointly guide student trainingResultsIn multi-step prediction experiments, the distilled RCBAM\u2013TCN\u2013LSTM model achieved average reductions of 40%\u201360% in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE compared with the original RCBAM and TCN\u2013LSTM models, while improving R\u00b2 by 4%\u20136%. The approach maintained high accuracy across different prediction horizons while reducing computational complexity.DiscussionThe proposed method effectively balances high-precision modeling of spatiotemporal dependencies with lightweight deployment requirements, enabling real-time air-traffic monitoring and early warning on standard CPUs and embedded devices. This framework offers a scalable solution for enhancing the operational safety and efficiency of modern air-traffic control systems.",

    "title": "Variable admittance control with sEMG-based support for wearable wrist exoskeleton",
    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

    "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
    "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",

    "content": "In multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm), achieving consistent imaging quality across all spectral channels is crucial for accurately identifying a wide range of fluorophores. However, these essential measurements are frequently compromised by saturation artifacts due to the inherently limited dynamic range of detection systems. To address this issue, we present SatCompFLImNet, a deep learning-based network specifically designed to correct saturation artifacts in multispectral FLIm, facilitating high dynamic range applications. Leveraging generative adversarial networks, SatCompFLImNet effectively compensates for saturated fluorescence signals, ensuring accurate lifetime measurements across various levels of saturation. Extensively validated with simulated and real-world data, SatCompFLImNet demonstrates remarkable capability in correcting saturation artifacts, improving signal-to-noise ratios, and maintaining fidelity of lifetime measurements.

    "title": "mmWave Radar for Sit-to-Stand Analysis: A Comparative Study With Wearables and Kinect",
    "content": "This study investigates a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, aiming to develop a non-contact, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational solution for healthcare applications. A 60 GHz mmWave radar system was employed to collect radar point cloud data from 45 participants performing STS motions. Using a deep learning-based pose estimation model and Inverse Kinematics (IK), we calculated joint angles, segmented STS motions, and extracted clinically relevant features for fall risk assessment. The extracted features were compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. While Kinect provided a reference for motion capture, we acknowledge its limitations compared to the gold-standard VICON system, which is planned for future validation. The results demonstrated that mmWave radar effectively captures general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk), though challenges remain for more fine-grained motion analysis. This study highlights the unique advantages and limitations of mmWave radar and other sensors, emphasizing the potential of integrated sensor technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Future work will expand the scope to more complex movements and incorporate high-precision motion capture systems to further validate the findings.",

    "title": "Camera Seismocardiogram Based Monitoring of Left Ventricular Ejection Time",
    "content": "Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), reflecting the duration from the onset to the end of blood ejection by the left ventricle during each heartbeat, is a critical parameter for measuring cardiac pumping efficiency. Continuous and regular monitoring of LVET is particularly crucial in assessing cardiac health, valvular function, and myocardial contractility. Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can be utilized for LVET monitoring, as the temporal distance between the aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC) in SCG signals can accurately depict LVET. This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF. We validated the effectiveness of our AO and AC detection algorithm on a self-made dataset comprising 21 participants with 9616 SCG cycles. The benchmark shows that the detection accuracy for AO and AC reached 98.16% and 97.94%, respectively, with an mean absolute error of 0.5571 ms for LVET estimation. The results demonstrate that camera-SCG has strong potential for cardiac health monitoring.",

    "title": "Biophysical Modeling of Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering",
    "content": "The increasing demand for wearables necessitates efficient energy harvesting and wireless power transfer solutions. Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering (EQS-HBP) is a promising technology for wirelessly powering on-body devices, offering enhanced received power ($P_{rx}$) with full-body coverage. Unlike EQS Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which optimizes channel capacity, EQS-HBP focuses on maximizing ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, requiring a distinct biophysical model tailored to lower termination impedance ranges where ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ peaks. This paper presents comprehensive simulations\u2014finite element method (FEM), distributed circuit modeling\u2014and in-vivo experiments to characterize the body channel as a finite impedance wire, with impedance determined by body dimensions. Contact impedance between the body and receiver, inversely related to contact area, significantly affects ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, necessitating careful design for devices with small contact areas. Furthermore, the body cross-sectional area influences voltage recovery after the point of load, with smaller cross-sections yielding reduced recovery. A lumped circuit model is developed to encapsulate these findings with circuit techniques to maximize ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, demonstrating that series resonance in a ground-floated receiver reduces input impedance by over 65x and improves ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ by more than 25\u00d7 over parallel resonance. We also propose a method to approximate optimal loading impedance for various receiver configurations and analyze the impact of inductor Q factor. We prove that neither series nor parallel resonance can mitigate the transmitter return path capacitance. These insights enable the development of a much higher on-body wireless power transfer method, advancing wearable device technology for applications in healthcare, fitness, and beyond.",

    "title": "Risk of postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events in patients with spontaneous intracranial hematoma stratified by type 2 diabetes mellitus",
    "content": "Background and purposeDiabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common concomitant disease of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events (post-MACEs) may diminish the surgical benefits of patients with ICH. However, evidence regarding the impact of DM on post-MACEs remains limited.MethodsThis was a multicenter cohort study that enrolled ICH patients presenting to eight neurosurgery departments between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. Patients were categorized into DM group and no diabetes mellitus (nDM) group, based on the presence or absence of DM. Intergroup comparisons were performed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact of DM on post-MACEs and 30-days mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. A stratified analysis was also conducted based on the type of post-MACEs.ResultsA total of 688 ICH patients were included in the study, of whom 576 (83.7%) were classified into the nDM group and 112 (16.3%) into the DM group. Compared with the nDM group, the DM group exhibited significantly higher incidences of overall post-MACEs (28.6%), ischemic post-MACEs (14.3%), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (23.2%), and 30-days mortality (9.8%). After adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, alcohol, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, antiplatelet therapy, and intraventricular hemorrhage, DM remained a significant predictor of overall post-MACEs (OR: 1.790, 95%CI: 1.072\u20132.990, p\u202f=\u202f0.026), ischemic post-MACEs (OR: 2.139, 95%CI: 1.090\u20134.197, p\u202f=\u202f0.027), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (OR: 1.778, 95%CI: 1.015\u20133.114, p\u202f=\u202f0.044), and 30-days mortality (OR: 3.593, 95%CI: 1.536\u20138.406, p\u202f=\u202f0.003).ConclusionIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that DM serves as a significant risk factor for ischemic post-MACEs, hemorrhagic post-MACEs, and 30-days mortality among patients with ICH.",

The gray matter thickness, cortical surface area and sulcal depth of the two groups were compared. The relationships between altered cortical characteristics and flight training days were investigated through correlation analysis.ResultsThe results indicated that flight training was associated with certain parameters of brain structure. Specifically, in the left rostral anterior cingulate area, the flight group displayed prominent gyri, whereas the control group exhibited sulci. The structural changes in these two groups followed completely opposite trends.ConclusionIn conclusion, the affected areas are primarily concentrated in brain regions associated with multisensory integration and multitasking, which may reflect neural adaptations induced by flight training.",

The present study evaluates the Individual Differences in Dutch Language Skills (IDLaS-NL) test battery, a collection of online tests designed to measure linguistic experience, domain-general cognitive skills, and linguistic processing. Implemented using Frinex, a programming environment developed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, IDLaS-NL allows researchers to customize test selections via a web platform. We conducted two studies to assess the timing precision of five chronometric tests within the battery. In Study 1, we evaluated the initial implementation of the tests, analyzing differences between expected and recorded stimulus presentation times, response latencies, and recording delays using the custom-made Web Experiment Analyzer (WEA). The results indicated imprecisions in some measures, particularly for reaction time and audio recording onset. Visual stimulus presentation, on the other hand, was fairly accurate. Study 2 introduced refined timing mechanisms in Frinex, incorporating specialized triggers for stimulus presentation and response registration. These adjustments improved timing precision, especially for speech production tasks. Overall, our findings confirm that Frinex achieves timing precision comparable to other widely used experimental platforms. While some variability in stimulus presentation and response timing is inherent to online testing, the results provide researchers with useful estimates of expected precision levels when using Frinex. This study contributes to the growing body of research on online testing methodologies by offering empirical insights into timing accuracy in web-based experiments.",

    "content": "Genomic instability is a key feature of many neurological disorders, with transposon activation and nucleotide triplet repeat instability playing critical roles. Transposons, which are also referred to as mobile genetic elements, have the potential to destabilize the genome and interfere with gene expression. Conversely, changes in nucleotide triplet sequences, such as expansions or contractions, can lead to the production of abnormal proteins or nonfunctional RNAs. In this perspective, we discussed the intricate relationship between these two forms of genomic instability and their influence on brain disorders. We analyzed the molecular mechanisms that contribute to these phenomena, the shared regulatory systems that govern them, and their role in neurological conditions. Additionally, we provided some insights into the development of potential therapies for brain disorders linked to these genomic alterations.",

    "content": "From the pioneering days of cochlear implants (CIs) more than half a century ago until the present time, speech perception outcomes remain a broadly recognized benchmark of CI success. However, speech test scores alone do not directly map onto individual patients\u2019 aural communication needs. Rather, speech tests provide a relatively time-efficient way to assess specific aspects of everyday speech processing abilities. We review how speech perception testing has evolved in the United States of America since the early days of CIs and critically examine its current clinical roles: (1) establishing CI candidacy, (2) measuring benefit post-CI, and (3) pinpointing specific perceptual deficits to guide counseling, rehabilitation, or programming changes. We further consider: (a) factors that have driven changes in how speech perception has been evaluated over time, (b) approaches to selecting outcome measures of speech perception and interpretation of outcomes, (c) the role that speech perception plays in the assessment of overall CI benefit and individualized rehabilitation, and (d) how test selection and conditions can influence CI care. We argue that conventional speech perception tests provide only a partial view of CI outcomes and call for more comprehensive, ecologically meaningful assessment approaches. We conclude with recommendations for selecting outcome measures that better reflect real-world communication demands and guide patient-centered care for adult CI users.",

    "title": "Cerebrovascular autoregulation in hypoxia: quantitative insights from arterial spin labeling",
    "content": "Hypoxia, defined as an insufficient oxygen supply relative to metabolic demand, induces a cascade of cerebrovascular and metabolic responses aimed at preserving cerebral homeostasis. These responses vary depending on the temporal profile of exposure, with acute (e.g., hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy, acute high-altitude exposure) versus chronic (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, long-term altitude residence) conditions, and may range from compensatory vasodilation to long-term maladaptive remodeling. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI offers a quantitative, non-invasive, and contrast-free method to assess cerebral perfusion, making it well-suited to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of these responses. This narrative review critically examines the application of ASL to quantify key hemodynamic parameters, including cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterial transit time (ATT), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), and, when integrated with complementary models, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO\u2082), in the context of hypoxia. By synthesizing evidence from both environmental and pathological models induced by hypoxia, we highlight how ASL captures early signatures of cerebrovascular adaptation, impaired autoregulation, and emerging neurovascular dysfunction. Particular emphasis is placed on the potential of ASL-derived metrics to serve as early biomarkers for hypoxia-induced risk, enabling non-invasive longitudinal tracking of vascular integrity in both clinical and subclinical populations. Overall, ASL emerges as a powerful modality for elucidating the mechanisms of neurovascular adaptation to hypoxia and for supporting precision diagnostics in disorders where oxygen insufficiency constitutes a key pathophysiological driver.",

    "content": "Objective. Human\u2013robot collaboration in lower-limb rehabilitation devices imposes stringent requirements on both the recognition accuracy of motion intention and real-time responsiveness. The precise recognition of lower limb motion based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has always been a primary focus of study. However, achieving low-delay recognition in lower limb continuous motion while maintaining accuracy remains a challenge, which is key to unlocking the full potential for the effective deployment and widespread application of robots. Approach. An innovative recognition method in lower limb continuous motion was presented in this paper, which investigated the instantaneous recognition network (IRN) and continuous recognition (CR) model. Main results. The comparative analysis revealed that by utilizing an optimal length of 210 for the onset-window sEMG data, the proposed IRN could substantially reduce the time delay from 300 ms/350 ms to 60 ms at the methodological level. The implementation of the class-balanced method enhanced motion recognition accuracy by an additional 4.83% within the onset window. The CR model was validated across seven scenarios, comprehensively covering all potential situations in daily continuous movements, and achieved an average accuracy of 96.31%. Significance. This study demonstrates the potential of the proposed instantaneous recognition method to enhance performance in lower limb continuous motion, providing an innovative approach for research on human\u2013robot synchronization.",

    "title": "Extracting robust single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials for non-invasive brain computer interfaces",
    "content": "Objective. Reliable extraction of single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) is essential for developing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications to support rehabilitation after brain injury. For real-time feedback, these responses must be extracted prospectively on every trial, with minimal post-processing and artifact correction. However, noninvasive SEPs elicited by electrical stimulation at recommended parameter settings (0.1\u20130.2 msec pulse width, stimulation at or below motor threshold, 2\u20135 Hz frequency) are typically small and variable, often requiring averaging across multiple trials or extensive processing. Here, we describe and evaluate ways to optimize the stimulation setup to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of noninvasive single-trial SEPs, enabling more reliable extraction. Approach. SEPs were recorded with scalp electroencephalography in tibial nerve stimulation in thirteen healthy people, and two people with CNS injuries. Three stimulation frequencies (lower than recommended: 0.2 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz) with a pulse width longer than recommended (1 msec), at a stimulation intensity based on H-reflex and M-wave at Soleus muscle were evaluated. Detectability of single-trial SEPs relative to background noise was tested offline and in a pseudo-online analysis, followed by a real-time demonstration. Mainresults. SEP N70 was observed predominantly at the central scalp regions. Online decoding performance was significantly higher with Laplacian filter. Generalization performance showed an expected degradation, at all frequencies, with an average decrease of 5.9% (multivariate) and 6.5% (univariate), with an AUC score ranging from 0.78\u20130.90. The difference across stimulation frequencies was not significant. In individuals with injuries, AUC of 0.86 (incomplete spinal cord injury) and 0.81 (stroke) was feasible. Real-time demonstration showed SEP detection with AUC of 0.89. Significance. This study describes and evaluates a system for extracting single-trial SEPs in real-time, suitable for a BCI-based operant conditioning. It enhances SNR of individual SEPs by alternate electrical stimulation parameters, dry headset, and optimized signal processing.",

    "title": "Unveiling functional heterogeneity in anatomical functional areas: a framework for fine-grained functional connectivity analysis of wide-field calcium imaging data",
    "content": "Objective. Conventional functional connectivity (FC) analysis of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data relies on the assumption of homogeneity within predefined anatomical functional areas (FAs), where the signal averaged within each FA serves as the foundation for inter-FA connectivity modeling. However, accumulating evidence suggested significant intra-FA functional heterogeneity with functionally distinct subregions. This study aims to systematically examine the existence of the heterogeneity and the consequences of violating the homogeneity assumption on the FC analysis. Approach. We propose a three-step approach: (1) The spatiotemporal clustering of pixels with similar activity dynamics into functional parcels (FPs). (2) Classifying FPs according to their cortex-wide connectivity profiles into four categories: cross-hemispheric (CH), unihemispheric (UH), cross-modal (CM) and unimodal (UM). (3) Gauging the consequences and utility of above analysis. Main results. Analysis of adult mice WFCI data (n = 6) shows that pixels can be reliably clustered into FPs, and that FPs fall into different categories and form distinct subregions, unveiling the functional heterogeneity within each FA. Crucially, fine-grained FC analysis for different categories of subregions uncovered significant differences compared to the results from the conventional method. Application of the analysis to longitudinal WFCI data on mouse brain development (n = 17) demonstrates increases in CM and CH subregions and decreases in UM and UH subregions over time, in line with expectations based on prior research into neurodevelopment and network reorganization. Significance. The present study develops a fine-grained FC analysis framework, leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution of WFCI to more precisely characterize large-scale cortical network dynamics. The observed differences between FCs derived using the proposed framework and those from conventional methods highlight the need for caution regarding the functional homogeneity assumption in conventional FC analysis. Furthermore, the developmental regularities revealed in longitudinal mouse brain data demonstrate the utility of fine-grained FC analysis.",

Previous research has extensively explored cortical responses during routine walking and complex gait scenarios. However, these studies often conflate basic gait control with cognitive demands, making it unclear how distinct cortical responses are elicited by automated versus discrete gait tasks. To address this, integrated EEG-fNIRS enables high spatiotemporal resolution characterization of cortical responses...",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Unfolding Suppression: statistical learning drives suppression through dynamic attentional states modulated by threat",
    "content": "How does statistical learning drive distractor suppression? A central debate in current research concerns whether the underlying mechanism operates proactively or reactively. Here, we propose a Temporal Dynamics of Attentional Suppression (TDAS) hypothesis, successfully reconciling these seemingly contradictory views. Across four visual search experiments, participants faced a probabilistic electric shock when a neutral distractor (Experiments 1a, 1b) or a threat-associated distractor (Experiments 2a, 2b) appeared at a threat-related high-probability location. Trial-averaged results showed faster responses and reduced fixations on distractors, but slower responses and fewer fixations on targets at these locations, consistent with learned distractor suppression. SMART analyses for eye-tracking data further revealed that learned suppression emerged from temporal state transitions: from distractor dominance via attentional limbo states to proactive suppression. Critically, spatial probability gates suppression pathways. At low-probability locations, suppression transitions to limbo states, while at high-probability locations, suppression either unfolds through the full three-state sequence or shifts directly from attentional limbo states to proactive suppression. Furthermore, threat signals accelerated these transitions compared to neutral contexts. Overall, these findings contribute to resolving the ongoing debate about the mechanisms of learned distractor suppression. They also offer a new theoretical perspective by establishing spatiotemporally distributed suppression as a core principle of attentional selection, thereby providing a unifying framework for understanding the dynamic nature of attentional control.",

    "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
    "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

    "title": "Mapping body-related research within the experimental landscape of anorexia nervosa: a scoping review",
    "content": "IntroductionAnorexia Nervosa (AN) is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized not only by restrictive eating behaviors and fear of weight gain, but also by emotional dysregulation, cognitive rigidity, and a profound disturbance in bodily experience. While bodily disturbance is clinically central, its multifaceted and pre-reflective nature has made it difficult to investigate experimentally. This scoping review aims to map the experimental case-control literature on AN from the past 15 years, with particular attention to how studies on body representation are represented within the broader field of AN research, both in terms of their prevalence and their subdivision into specific thematic domains.MethodsA systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they involved an experimental task comparing individuals with AN to healthy controls.ResultsThe search yielded six hundred and three eligible studies, each classified into one or more thematic domains: cognition, emotion/social cognition, food-related processing, reward, and body representation. Among these, one hundred and sixty four studies addressed body representation and were further categorized into five subdomains: body image, perception of other bodies, body schema, sensory processing, and interoception.DiscussionWhile studies on cognition, emotion, reward, and food processing often used standardized paradigms and showed moderate methodological consistency, research on the bodily domain was notably heterogeneous. This reflects both the conceptual complexity of corporeality and the lack of unified frameworks for its empirical investigation. A recent shift toward multisensory and embodiment-based paradigms suggests increasing interest in implicit and integrative models of body representation. By identifying patterns, gaps, and emerging trends, this review underscores the need for greater conceptual clarity and interdisciplinary convergence. Advancing the experimental study of body representation in AN may support more comprehensive models of the disorder and enhance our understanding of bodily experience in psychiatric conditions.",

    "content": "Objectives. Reconstruction of visual perception from brain signals has emerged as a promising research topic. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a kind of high-quality intracranial signal with good spatiotemporal resolution that offers some new opportunities. However, according to our knowledge, there are no studies to reconstruct the perceived images from human ECoG signals at present. Approach. We have conducted the pioneering work and developed a novel pipeline that integrates Talairach coordinate alignment masked autoencoders (TA-MAE) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our approach exploits the spatiotemporal dynamics of human ECoG signals, enabling the restoration of details in high-resolution. Main results. Experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of appearance, structure, signal-noise ratio, and semantic consistency. Additionally, our study indicated that unsupervised learning-based signal reconstruction outperforms manually annotated label-guided feature recognition in capturing the low-dimensional representation of brain signals, potentially facilitating the exploration of vision\u2019s intrinsic mechanisms. Significance. These results highlight the advantages of unsupervised decoding and provide a generalizable framework for human ECoG-based visual reconstruction.",

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder.

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Anomalous experiences are associated with high subconscious connectedness.",
    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

    "title": "Toward accurate single image sand dust removal by utilizing uncertainty-aware neural network",
    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

    "content": "There are different perspectives on the psychological constructs of resilience and hypnotizability, and both are related to aspects of mental health. Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

However, research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy of acceptance, which may be related to instructions to accept different aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., thoughts vs. emotion). We compared the effects of self-regulation instructions to accept thoughts, emotions, or a combination of both on measures of affect (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, state anxiety) and emotional dysregulation immediately following emotion-eliciting film clips and following recovery periods after film clips. We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip. Implications of findings and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The current preregistered study (<em>N</em> = 104) used a 3-week longitudinal design to investigate the relationships between the frequency of recalled NBMs, memory distrust, rumination over autobiographical events, and self-esteem. Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: There is a need for effective cognitive assessment tools to evaluate the development of very young children in resource-limited low- and middle-income country settings. Our objective was to evaluate the field usability of a computer-based attention test and its concurrent validity with a caregiver-reported screener of neurodevelopment in rural, Ecuadorian children. Method: To assess a computer-based attention test in a resource-limited setting, 41 Ecuadorian children between 2 and 4 years of age were evaluated once with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention adapted to eye-tracking instrumentation. To evaluate the validity of the ECVT, results were compared with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133, measured 3\u20134 times between 21 and 48 months of age. Results: ECVT measures were collected successfully for 97.6% of children (40/41), suggesting good field usability of the test in this resource-limited setting. An increase in 1 SD in child attention, as measured by the ECVT average fixation duration, was associated with a 7.9-point increase in the overall Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133 score (95% CI [1.5, 14.2], <em>p</em> = .015). Conclusions: A computer-based attention assessment in early childhood was usable in a resource-limited setting and predictive of a caregiver-reported screener of child neurodevelopment. The ECVT, therefore, can be used to assess the effects of early risk factors and resilience in brain/behavior development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index \u201cspeed\u201d potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. Method: The present study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children aged 8\u201312 with and without ADHD (<em>N</em> = 119). Results: There was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the <em>tau</em> parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD and among children with low working memory capacity (regardless of ADHD status). Variance in <em>tau</em> was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of adopting analytic methods that can more accurately describe performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Alcohol Dependence-Induced Astrocyte Immune Activation in the Nucleus Accumbens",
    "content": "Astrocytes play many physiological roles in the brain including maintenance of brain homeostasis, modulation of synapse formation and function, and regulation of the blood brain barrier permeability. Upon brain exposure to noxious stimuli, astrocytes can become reactive and activate neuroimmune responses. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical region involved in reward processing and is integrally involved in the establishment and maintenance of alcohol (ethanol, EtOH) dependence. Here we used the chronic intermittent ethanol - two-bottle choice (CIE-2BC) drinking model to induce EtOH dependence in Aldh1l1-eGFP/Rpl10a mice, which allow the pull-down of astrocyte specific RNA using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) procedure. NAc astrocyte translating RNA and bulk-tissue RNA was analyzed by RNA-Seq to identify genes altered by EtOH dependence or EtOH drinking in astrocytes and the bulk NAc. The number of differentially regulated genes was greater in the astrocyte-specific analysis compared to the bulk-tissue suggesting the cell-type specific approach enables greater resolution of the effects of EtOH. In the astrocyte-specific translatome of EtOH dependent animals, genes related to neuroimmune activation were highly enriched with overall activation of pathways related to interferon and interleukin signaling. In addition, pathways relating to oxidative stress and glutathione related responses were enriched in NAc astrocytes from dependent animals. In contrast, the astrocyte response to EtOH drinking identified pathways related to homeostatic changes. These findings highlight the profound immune activation in NAc astrocytes during EtOH dependence which are distinct from the response to lower levels of EtOH exposure. This study identifies astrocyte pathways and genes involved in the transition from alcohol drinking to alcohol dependence and identify potential novel cell type-specific targets that underlie vulnerability to alcohol use.",

    "content": "<p><i>MiRNA</i>-based therapeutics represent a promising approach for treating multiple diseases, yet the key regulatory <i>miRNAs</i> in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-related cognitive impairment remains unclear. Here, we identify <i>miR-153</i> as consistently upregulated in both male and female mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and late-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in the basal forebrain of both male and female postmortem AD specimens and male CCH rats. Knockdown of <i>miR-153</i> in the basal forebrain alleviated CCH-induced cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, <i>miR-153</i> directly targeted Karyopherin alpha 5 (KPNA5), a nuclear transport protein that facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation. <i>miR-153</i> suppressed <i>KPNA5</i> via two binding sites in its 3'UTR, impairing NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses and promoting oxidative stress, and KPNA5 bound to three nuclear localization sequences of NRF2 through protein interaction. Restoration of the <i>miR-153</i>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in the basal forebrain alleviated oxidative stress damage in male CCH rats, while no such effect was observed in the hippocampus. These findings reveal a potential role of the <i>miR-153</i>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in CCH-related cognitive decline.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The homophilic adhesion molecule Kirrel3 drives synapse formation between dentate granule (DG) neurons and GABA neurons, and Kirrel3 gene variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. However, the circuit function and behavioral relevance of Kirrel3-expressing neurons are unknown. Using intersectional genetics, we identified a population of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons that regulate memory discrimination in male and female mice. Using chemogenetics with in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral assays, we discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons, but not parvalbumin neurons, potently inhibits CA3 neuron activity and impairs contextual memory discrimination during recall, revealing a critical role for these neurons in the retrieval of precise memories. Light and electron microscopy of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons suggests that they receive direct excitation from DG neurons and project onto CA3 dendrites. Together, this multiscale approach demonstrates how cell type-specific expression of adhesion molecules mark subsets of neurons that control key features guiding memory and behavior.</p>",

    "title": "Impact of Elovl5 Deficiency on Cerebellar Excitatory Synaptic Transmission in Mice",
    "content": "<p>The neurotransmitter release and the synaptic vesicle cycle require a specific lipidic composition of presynaptic and vesicle membranes. Phospholipids with long-chain acyl groups are necessary to confer to membranes the physical properties necessary for synaptic transmission. Elovl5 is crucial for the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) beyond 18-carbon atoms, and its deletion or mutation causes cerebellar motor deficits in humans and mice. In the mouse cerebellum of both sexes, deletion of <i>Elovl5</i> increased 18- and 20-carbon atoms PUFAs, decreased long-chain PUFAs, and increased saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Electrophysiological recordings in Purkinje cells revealed that basal synaptic transmission was preserved in <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice. However, the recovery from depression of the climbing fiber synapse lacked the fast phase, suggesting a deficit in replenishment of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. The parallel fiber synapse showed slower replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool at relatively high but physiological frequencies of 50 and 100&nbsp;Hz. Endocannabinoids contain a long-chain PUFA, and in Purkinje cells, they mediate the synaptically induced suppression of excitation (SSE). In <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice, SSE had a shorter duration, suggesting a role of Elovl5 in this form of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, we show dramatic change in length and level of unsaturation of lipids in synaptosomes isolated from <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice. These results suggest that the shift in PUFA lipidic species caused by the absence of Elovl5, in the cerebellar cortex, is responsible for specific deficits in neurotransmitter release.</p>",

    "content": "<p>There is growing evidence that sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are equipped with mechanisms for \"gating\" nociceptive information before it enters the central nervous system. However, direct in vivo evidence remains limited due to the anatomical inaccessibility of the DRG. Here, we developed a decerebrate, arterially perfused preparation of the rat (of either sex) that allows simultaneous recordings from the C8 spinal nerve (SN) and dorsal root (DR), with full access to the corresponding DRG in the absence of anesthesia. The C8 segment contributes to the median nerve supplying the forepaw, which was used for sensory stimulation. Spikes in DR were recorded and temporally matched to their origin spikes in the SN. Noxious mechanical stimulation to the forepaw increased firing in both the SN and the DR, and application of GABA (200&nbsp;&micro;M) or the GABA reuptake inhibitor, NO-711 (200&nbsp;&micro;M), directly into the DRG significantly reduced firing frequency only in the DR without affecting SN activity. Spike sorting revealed that this reduction in the spike rate from SN to DR, a phenomenon we term here as \"filtering,\" was greater for C-fiber spikes compared with A-fiber spikes. Innocuous stimuli (brush/cotton bud strokes and proprioceptive stimulation) also increased firing in both SN and DR, but GABA application into the DRG failed to reduce DR firing rates. Taken together, our findings lend direct support to the hypothesis of peripheral gating of the nociceptive signaling at the DRG and highlight the therapeutic potential of these peripheral structures.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Selectivity for sensory modality characterizes distinct subregions of the human brain, well beyond the primary sensory cortices. We previously identified frontal and posterior cortical regions that are preferentially recruited for visual versus auditory attention and working memory (WM). Here, we extend our approach to include tactile cognition and to characterize cortical regions recruited by WM in each of three sensory modalities. The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform <i>N-</i>back WM judgments in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities. We confirmed our prior reports of multiple visual-biased and auditory-biased frontal lobe regions. We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including the dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including the precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula, and presupplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in the frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions. Lastly, resting-state analyses revealed that auditory-, visual-, and tactile-selective WM regions segregate into modality-specific networks that span the frontal and posterior cortex. Together, these results shed light on the functional organization of sensory-selective and supramodal regions supporting higher-order cognition.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Abnormal excitatory synaptic transmission in the human prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based primarily on genetic evidence. However, changes in synaptic function cannot be predicted from altered gene expressions, but determining the amount, density, and subsynaptic distribution of synaptic proteins is the only reliable indirect readout of function. Detecting proteins in individual synapses of human postmortem tissues has been severely constrained by technical limitations. Here we overcome this limitation by optimizing a high-resolution, quantitative localization method to facilitate antigen recognition at excitatory synapses in postmortem brains of both sexes. Using PSD-95 immunoreactivity as molecular marker of excitatory synapses, we demonstrate the lack of significant differences in synapse density and size in upper cortical layers of control and schizophrenia subjects. The synaptic densities of postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and presynaptic molecules Bassoon and Munc13-1 are also indistinguishable between control and schizophrenia subjects. The number of Munc13-1 nanoclusters, marking presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites, does not differ either. Excitatory synapses on parvalbumin expressing interneurons contain similar AMPA but significantly lower NMDA receptor densities in schizophrenia compared with control subjects.

    "title": "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Language Information Representation within the Left Inferior Parietal Lobule Network: An Intracranial SEEG Study",
    "content": "<p>The left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) supports diverse cognitive functions through the finely differentiated yet coordinated interactions of its subregions, including the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), angular gyrus (AG), and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (lbIPS). However, how these subregions dynamically represent and exchange information during cognitive processing remains unclear. Language processing, integrating visual form, phonology, and semantics provide an ideal model for investigating the IPL's functional capabilities and dynamics. To overcome the limitations of traditional neuroimaging techniques that lack the spatiotemporal resolution to capture these fast-evolving processes and univariate analyses unable to detect fine-grained representational structure in neural signals, we employed stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) in 13 epilepsy patients (eight males and five females) performing an oral word reading task. Combining SEEG with representational similarity analysis (RSA), a multivariate approach linking neural activity patterns to cognitive models, we mapped spatiotemporal language information dynamics across IPL subregions. Results revealed dynamic functional differentiation within the left IPL: the SMG and AG exhibited sequential language representations, with the SMG showing early semantics, followed by phonology and later visual form and semantics; the AG showed early semantics followed by visual form; in contrast, the lbIPS was engaged only in visual form representation. Connectivity analyses revealed the dynamic coordination among IPL subregions throughout the task. These findings demonstrate that the left IPL operates as a dynamic network, where functional specialization and interregional information exchange collectively support complex cognitive processes.</p>",

    "title": "Characterization of Auditory Responsive Neurons in the Mouse Superior Colliculus to White Noise and Frequency-Restricted Sounds",
    "content": "<p>Locating the source of a specific sound in a complex environment and determining its saliency is critical for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a sensorimotor midbrain structure, plays an important role in sound localization and has been shown to have a topographic map of the auditory space in a range of species. In mice, previous studies using broadband white noise stimuli found that high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural-level differences (ILDs) are used to generate a neuron's spatially restricted receptive field (RF) and that these RFs are organized topographically along the azimuth. However, in a naturalistic environment, the auditory stimuli that an animal encounters may have restricted spectral components, although these sound sources can still be localized efficiently. It remains unknown whether and how the SC neurons respond to frequency-restricted sounds and, in turn, how this changes the organization of their RFs into a topographic map. Here, we show results from large-scale in vivo physiological recordings of SC neurons from male and female mice in response to white noise, naturalistic ultrasonic pup call, and chirps. We find that mouse SC auditory neurons respond to a pup call and chirps with distinct temporal patterns and a spatial preference predominantly at ~60&deg; in contralateral azimuth. In addition, we categorized auditory SC neurons based on their spectrotemporal RF patterns and demonstrated that there are at least four classes of auditory-responsive neurons in the SC that lie in different locations along the anteroposterior axis of the SC.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Auditory perception can be modulated by other sensory stimuli. However, we do not fully understand the neural mechanisms that support multisensory behavior. Here, while male nonhuman primates detected a target vocalization that was embedded in a background chorus of vocalizations, we recorded spiking activity from the primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that a congruent video of a monkey eliciting the target vocalization improved the monkeys' behavior, relative to their performance when we only presented a static image of the monkey. As a proxy for the functional organization of A1, we compared the contribution of neurons with significant spectrotemporal response fields (STRFs) with those that had nonsignificant STRFs (nSTRFs). Because, on average, STRF and nSTRF neurons have different spike waveform shapes, firing rates, and neural-correlation structure, we hypothesized that they might belong to different neural populations. Consistent with this, we found that, although STRF neurons encode stimulus information through synchronized activity, task-related information in the primate A1 is encoded more as a structured dynamic process in the population of nSTRF neurons. Together, these findings suggest that modulatory multisensory behavior is supported by nSTRF neurons and identifies, for the first time, a functional differentiation between the role that STRF and nSTRF neurons contribute to behavior.</p>",

    "title": "A pilot study on simultaneous stimulation of the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area using gait-synchronized rhythmic brain stimulation to improve gait variability in post-stroke hemiparetic patients",
    "content": "IntroductionGait impairment is a common and disabling consequence of stroke. While walking speed is a key indicator of recovery, gait variability is closely associated with fall risk and long-term functional decline. Previous studies have suggested that functional interaction between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) plays a key role in post-stroke gait control. Rather than stimulating these regions independently, simultaneous activation of the SMA\u2014critical for rhythm modulation and motor planning\u2014and gait-synchronized stimulation of the M1\u2014essential for motor execution\u2014may offer enhanced benefits for gait stability.ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of a combined brain stimulation intervention targeting the SMA and M1 on gait variability and balance in individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis.MethodsSixteen individuals with stroke within 180 days after the onset, aged 40\u201390 years, who were able to walk on a treadmill were recruited in this study of multi-center, randomized, controlled pilot trial with a parallel-group design. Participants were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (n = 8) receiving 20 min of simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the SMA and gait-synchronized rhythmic stimulation to the M1 during treadmill walking, or to a control group (n = 8) receiving sham stimulation. Both groups underwent 15 sessions of walking practice over 3 weeks. Primary outcomes were feasibility indicators including recruitment, retention, adherence and adverse events and preliminary estimates of effect on gait variability such as coefficient of variation for stride, stance, and swing times on the paretic side. Balance was assessed using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest).ResultsAll 16 participants completed the intervention without adverse events, indicating high feasibility. The intervention group showed significantly reduced stride time variability on the paretic side and improved Mini-BESTest scores compared to the control group. A significant correlation was observed between reductions in gait variability and improvements in balance.ConclusionsThis pilot trial supports the feasibility and safety of a combined SMA and M1 stimulation approach. Preliminary findings suggest potential benefits in reducing gait variability and improving balance after stroke, warranting further investigation in a definitive trial.",

    "content": "BackgroundGait abnormalities in spastic cerebral palsy (CP) result from four primary neuromuscular impairments: muscle weakness, short muscle-relative-to-skeletal-length, muscle spasticity, and impaired selective motor control. The Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) was developed to help clinicians identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP for use in any clinical setting.AimsThis study evaluated use and validity of the observational-based Clinical GENI to identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in children with spastic CP.MethodsPatients with spastic CP seen in 2023 for instrumented gait analysis and physical exam of neuromuscular impairments were evaluated using the Clinical GENI. Validity was assessed by agreement between identification of gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI compared to 3D gait kinematics. Severity of neuromuscular impairments associated with gait abnormalities listed on the Clinical GENI was compared, and severity of neuromuscular impairment was correlated with severity of gait abnormalities.ResultsParticipants included 12 children with spastic CP (4 GMFCS I, 8 GMFCS II; mean age 11.25 years). The most common gait abnormalities were forefoot/flatfoot initial contact (IC) (16/24), flexed-knee IC (19/24), hip-flexion in single limb stance (12/24), and reduced pre-swing ankle plantarflexion (19/24). Strong agreement (83\u2013100%) occurred between gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI and kinematic values. Severity of neuromuscular impairment was higher (p < 0.05) for those with gait abnormalities vs. without and correlated to severity of gait abnormalities in a majority of comparisons.ConclusionResults support clinical utility and validity of the Clinical GENI for evaluating gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP.",

    "content": "AimsAlthough accumulating evidence has demonstrated the involvement of the insular cortex in autonomic regulation, the precise functional topography of insular subdivisions mediating cardiovascular control remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the role of the insula, with high anatomic precision, in regulating heart rate (HR).MethodsOverall, 487 electrical stimulations (E-stim) in patients with refractory epilepsy were used to investigate the incidence of evoked cardiac response after insula E-stim. Correlations between the parameters of E-stim, insula subdivision, and the HR shift profile were analyzed.ResultsBriefly, 40.8% of insula stimulations evoked a cardiac response. The left insula was more likely to induce cardiac responses. Compared to the electrode contacts in the declining HR group, those in the elevated HR group were predominantly distributed in the posterior insula. Notably, the middle short gyri can rapidly elicit a significant decrease in HR.ConclusionOur findings suggest that the middle short gyrus of the insula may serve as the primary cortical region mediating HR reduction. This provides new insights for the prevention and treatment of arrhythmias and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).",

Here, we determine whether familiarizing individuals with self-appraisal with daily memory testing for 7 days provide a more accurate estimate of cognitive functioning and mood. Method: Two hundred twenty-five participants (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> \u00b1 <em>SD</em>: 74.1 \u00b1 8.3 years; 66% female; median education 16.0 years) completed the online Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health, which included two associative memory tasks, for seven consecutive days. Each day, participants self-appraised their performance. At baseline, they completed various cognitive and mood measures. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between task performance and self-appraisal on Days 1 and 7 and used linear models to examine the relationship between self-appraisal scores and clinical measures. Results: Accuracy (Day 1: 0.44 \u00b1 0.12; Day 7: 0.81 \u00b1 0.16) and self-appraisal (Day 1: 0.36 \u00b1 0.15; Day 7: 0.70 \u00b1 0.21) increased, as did the association between accuracy and self-appraisal, Day 1: correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [0.09, 0.34], <em>p</em> = .001; Day 7: <em>r</em> = 0.69, 95% CI [0.62, 0.76], <em>p</em> < .001. Self-appraisal scores on Day 7, but not Day 1, showed significant relationships with in-clinic measures. Conclusions: Repeated remote cognitive assessments may help elucidate individuals\u2019 capacities to refine their self-perception of cognitive performance during multiday learning. The weak association between accuracy and test-na\u00efve self-appraisal warrants caution about using this metric cross-sectionally. Experienced self-appraisal could be especially relevant at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when subtle learning difficulties emerge and could improve our capacity to detect early meta-cognitive changes.

    "title": "Robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms in Spanish individuals with nonpathological Alzheimer\u2019s disease biomarkers.",
    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychological norms serve to identify cognitive impairment and monitor neurodegenerative disease progression. However, longitudinal data are limited, and conventional approaches do not account for biomarkers to exclude underlying Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, reducing sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive decline in preclinical AD. To address these limitations, this research provides robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms derived from Spanish individuals with nonpathological levels of AD biomarkers. Method: We analyzed 3-year follow-up data from 350 cognitively unimpaired individuals (Alzheimer\u2019s and Families+ cohort). A subset of 228 individuals with normal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242/40, phosphorylated-tau181, and total-tau biomarkers defined the robust reference group. Neuropsychological assessment encompassed the Trail Making Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Memory Binding Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013IV, Wechsler Memory Scale\u2013IV, Semantic Fluency Test, and Judgment of Line Orientation from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Using the Reliable Change Index and Standardized Regression-Based methods, robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms were derived from the reference group. Validation analysis assessed the sensitivity of robust versus conventional normative procedures. Results: Models, equations, percentiles, and cutoffs for identifying significant cognitive decline were provided. Robust norms showed modestly greater sensitivity in certain measures, particularly in episodic memory. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: Total Free Delayed Recall showed the most notable result at the 5th percentile in Reliable Change Index (\u03c7\u00b2 = 16.06, <em>p</em> = 6.15E-05). Conclusions: Robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms may improve the detection of subtle cognitive decline, modestly enhancing sensitivity at the lower ends of distributions.

    "title": "Posttraumatic stress symptomatology rather than mild traumatic brain injury is related to atypical early neural processing during cognitive control.",
    "content": "Objective: Many veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) report disruptions in cognition; however, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these cognitive difficulties are not well understood. It is also unknown whether PTSD symptomatology or past mTBIs uniquely impact functions important to adaptation such as cognitive control. Method: We examined event-related potentials elicited by a flanker task to evaluate brain responses during conflict monitoring in a sample of 192 U.S. military veterans with combat-zone experience and exposure to explosive blasts. Clinical assessments characterized diagnoses as well as the severity of PTSD symptoms and mTBI so that we could parse overlapping syndromes and directly contrast effects of the two conditions. Results: Across groups, participants performed worse on conflict trials (Incongruent distractors), particularly when preceded by a no-conflict (Congruent distractors) trial. We found that greater dysphoric PTSD symptomatology was related to a reduced early perceptual response (P1), while greater avoidance PTSD symptomatology predicted a larger early visual attention response (N1). Although late cognitive processes (N2, P3) were sensitive to cognitive control demands of the flanker task, posttraumatic symptomatology and mTBI severity were unrelated to them. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the Avoidance and Dysphoria domains of PTSD symptomatology may differentially relate to early neural functions of perception and visual attention rather than later cognitive responses. Rehabilitation and treatment of individuals with PTSD and mTBI may be most productive when focused on perceptual and attentional processing, which could improve cognitive control.

    "title": "Acquired crowding dyslexia: A peripheral reading deficit other than neglect dyslexia.",
    "content": "Objectives: Crowding refers to the phenomenon whereby small visual objects above the acuity threshold are detected but unrecognizable when surrounded by nearby stimuli. It affects reading in healthy individuals and can be enhanced in reading impairments. By increasing the interletter space, crowding decreases. Previous evidence on patients with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and peripheral dyslexia has shown a dissociation in sensitivity to spacing manipulation between those who mainly produced omissions and those characterized by substitutions in reading. Here, we wanted to verify the hypothesis that the reading impairment mainly characterized by substitutions is dissociated from USN, unlike the one characterized by omissions. Method: In a retrospective study, we collected 38 right-brain-damaged patients, 21 with USN. We analyzed the number and types of errors in reading single words and pseudowords, spaced and unspaced, comparing patients with and without USN. Results: USN patients showed significantly more omissions than patients without USN and increased omissions with letter spacing. Substitutions were more frequent in USN patients but did not increase with spacing. Performance of patients mainly characterized by substitutions revealed a reduction of errors with spaced pseudowords and a double dissociation from USN. Lesion overlap analysis suggested that the two deficits could depend on different components of visuospatial attention networks. Conclusions: We claim that proper neglect dyslexia is characterized by omission errors and has USN as a necessary mechanism, even if not sufficient. Conversely, acquired crowding dyslexia is a different reading deficit, characterized by substitutions due to an enhanced crowding phenomenon, independent of USN.

    "title": "Joint effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cannabis on neurocognition.",
    "content": "Objective: Cannabis has become increasingly accessible to populations living with chronic health conditions such as HIV. Many people living with HIV are turning to cannabis for symptom relief despite the unclear risks to neurocognitive health. Our study sought to replicate and extend prior research by examining global and domain-specific neurocognitive performance between four groups stratified by use of cannabis (CB; CB+/CB\u2212) and HIV serostatus (HIV+/HIV\u2212). Method: Our demographically diverse community sample (<em>N</em> = 269) underwent exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the effects of cannabis use (CU) and HIV on neurocognition. We explored between-group comparisons of neurocognitive performance, probability of neurocognitive impairment, and interactive effects of CU/HIV serostatus. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed nonsignificant differences in global or domain-specific neurocognitive performance. However, the CB+/HIV+ group was three times (99% CI [1.18, 9.57]) more likely to be labeled with a memory impairment compared to the control (CB-/HIV\u2212), and the CB+/HIV\u2212 group was twice (99% CI [.14, 7.47]) as likely to be labeled with an executive functioning impairment compared to the control. We also identified an interactive effect between the past 30-day CU and HIV serostatus for global (<em>b</em> = \u2212.026, 99% CI [\u2212.04, \u2212.01]) and motor (<em>b</em> = \u2212.052, 99% CI [\u2212.07, \u2212.03]) neurocognitive performance. Findings support a nuanced relationship between CU and HIV, which may partly explain mixed literature. Conclusions: Although we conclude that recent and heavy CU poses risk of neurocognitive decline among people living with HIVs, this effect is modest. Physicians and patients must weigh a possible decrease in global and motor neurocognition against the severity of symptoms being treated.

    "content": "There are dream metaphors that express waking-life experiences indirectly. Animals in dreams have been speculated to be related to dream metaphors. Here, we explored if there was any relationship between waking-life experiences related to elder relatives with both dreaming about elder relatives and dreaming about animals. For 1 day, 270 participants recorded waking-life experiences in daily diaries before sleeping and recorded their dreams upon waking. Two external judges rated if there was any content related to elder relatives or animals in both daily diaries and dreams. The most three frequent animals in dreams were dogs, cats, and snakes, or fishes, or birds. The frequency of waking-life experiences related to elder relatives was correlated with both the frequency of dreaming about elder relatives and the frequency of dreaming about animals. Yet, the latter two variables were not correlated with each other. The results supported the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. In addition, the results may suggest that some animals in dreams represented elder relatives in waking life metaphorically. Moreover, the results may support Carl Jung\u2019s idea that the image of animals in dreams may be a symbol of parents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

A questionnaire was administered to 384 participants (mean age = 20.63 years, SD = 1.21; 205 females, 179 males), revealing that over half of them reported having sexual dreams, with a higher prevalence among males. The sexual dream group scored higher than the nonsexual dream group on aggressiveness, neuroticism, and sensation seeking. Furthermore, negative emotions, sensation seeking, activity, and extraversion play an important role in the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences among sexual dreamers. These findings provide valuable insights for sexual education practitioners to understand individuals\u2019 sexual dream experiences and related psychological factors, contributing to scientific advancements in sexual health and education.

The present, brief report is a post hoc analysis of previously unanalyzed items from two studies of bereaved individuals. One study focused on loss following the death of a romantic partner (n = 268) and the other following the death of a dog or cat (n = 199). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had dreamed of the deceased or had a waking experience of seeing, hearing, or feeling the touch of the deceased in the prior month. Consistent with prior research, a substantial portion of each sample (50.7% of the partner loss participants and 32.2% of the pet loss) reported at least one waking experience of seeing, hearing, and/or feeling the deceased. When dreaming of the deceased and/or having a waking experience of the deceased were combined, it was found to be 82.5% for partner loss and 68.2% for pet loss. Furthermore, dreaming about the deceased was related to having such waking experiences. These preliminary, exploratory findings contribute to the growing recognition that we need more research and theory into the function of such experiences for the bereaved and for those facing end of life.

    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "title": "Combined long nerve allograft and nerve transfer for functional recovery of ulnar nerve: case study with longitudinal clinical and neurodiagnostic follow-up",
    "content": "BackgroundPeripheral nerve injuries involving large gaps (>50 mm) are associated with poor outcomes due to delayed axonal regeneration and limited reconstructive options. While autografts are traditionally the gold standard, their use is limited by donor site morbidity and length constraints. Processed nerve allografts have emerged as an alternative, but data on their long-term efficacy, particularly for gaps \u226560 mm remain limited.Case reportWe present a case of a 15-year-old male with a 68-mm ulnar nerve gap following trauma reconstructed acutely with a processed nerve allograft. This procedure was performed in conjunction with an anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) to ulnar motor branch transfer and ulnar nerve decompression of potential entrapment sites.ResultsSerial assessments over 4.5 years demonstrated substantial recovery. By 16 months, the patient had regained strong grip strength, full range of motion, and near-normal sensory thresholds. At final follow-up, he had returned to all activities without limitations. Serial EMGs confirmed early nascent motor unit recruitment by 3 months, progressive reinnervation at 16 months, and persistent low-amplitude responses at 54 months, suggestive of ongoing but incomplete reinnervation.ConclusionThis case provides the longest known electrodiagnostic follow-up of a long-gap ulnar nerve allograft reconstruction. It supports the feasibility of processed allografts for gaps \u226470 mm and emphasizes the value of long-term EMG monitoring in tracking regeneration. These findings contribute critical data to a sparsely studied domain and help define expectations for complex nerve repairs.",

    "content": "IntroductionToxic Oil Syndrome (TOS) emerged in Spain in 1981 after ingestion of rapeseed oil adulterated with aniline derivatives. More than four decades later, survivors continue to report cognitive complaints, but objective evidence of long-term dysfunction remains limited.MethodsIn this case-control study, 47 TOS survivors and 44 matched healthy controls completed validated eye-tracking paradigms (visually guided, memory-guided, and antisaccade tasks) and a standardized neuropsychological battery. Groups did not differ significantly in age, sex, or education.ResultsTOS survivors showed preserved performance on visually guided and memory-guided saccades, with no group differences in latency, gain, peak velocity, or spatial error (all p\u202f>\u202f0.05). In contrast, they exhibited fewer correct antisaccades (mean 3.6 vs. 5.0; p = 0.029), more reflexive saccades (mean 7.0 vs. 5.7; p = 0.033), and increased backward reflexive saccades (mean 6.3 vs. 5.1; p = 0.040). Cognitive testing revealed selective impairments in executive function, attention, and processing speed, with preserved memory. Structural equation modeling confirmed that antisaccade impairment remained significant after adjusting for confounders and demonstrated an independent contribution of attention to correct antisaccade performance.ConclusionFindings indicate persistent frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction in TOS survivors, consistent with immune- or vascular-mediated injury patterns rather than progressive neurodegeneration. Eye-tracking provides a noninvasive biomarker of latent executive dysfunction and may be useful for long-term monitoring of populations exposed to environmental toxins.",

    "title": "The speech reception threshold can be estimated using EEG electrodes in and around the ear",
    "content": "Objective. Previous studies have demonstrated that the speech reception threshold (SRT) can be estimated using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), referred to as SRTneuro. The present study assesses the feasibility of using ear-EEG, which allows for discreet measurement of neural activity from in and around the ear, to estimate the SRTneuro. Approach. Twenty young normal-hearing participants listened to audiobook excerpts at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) whilst wearing a 66-channel EEG cap and 12 ear-EEG electrodes. A linear decoder was trained on different electrode configurations to estimate the envelope of the audio excerpts from the EEG recordings. The reconstruction accuracy was determined by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the actual and the estimated envelope. A sigmoid function was then fitted to the reconstruction-accuracy-vs-SNR data points, with the midpoint of the sigmoid serving as the SRTneuro estimate for each participant. Main results. Using only in-ear electrodes, the estimated SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the behaviorally measured SRT (SRTbeh) for 6 out of 20 participants (30%). With electrodes placed both in and around the ear, the SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants (95%) and thus on par with the reference estimate obtained from full-scalp EEG. Using only electrodes in and around the ear from the right side of the head, the SRTneuro remained within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants. Significance. These findings suggest that the SRTneuro can be reliably estimated using ear-EEG, especially when combining in-ear electrodes and around-the-ear electrodes. Such an estimate can be highly useful e.g. for continuously adjusting noise-reduction algorithms in hearing aids or for logging the SRT in the user\u2019s natural environment.",

This study compared the relative strength of these dispositions in predicting nightmare frequency. A sample of 116 university students completed measures of nightmare frequency, neuroticism, nightmare proneness, thin psychological boundaries, and sensory processing sensitivity. After accounting for sociodemographic variables and dream recall frequency, only nightmare proneness and thin boundaries significantly independently predicted nightmare frequency. These findings highlight the importance of nightmare proneness and thin boundaries as predictors, underscoring the need for further research with diverse samples to better understand these relationships.

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War have profoundly affected individuals worldwide, eliciting heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and fear. This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Anti-ELAB) was a 7-month large-scale and highly traumatic social movement in Hong Kong that began in March 2019 in opposition to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government to amend its extradition laws. Using a sample of 112 Chinese young adult (74 females, 38 males, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.83) residents in Hong Kong, this article reports an investigation into relationships between trauma (as manifested in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), dream content (dream motifs, classified according to persecution or ego ideal delusional inclinations), and nightmare distress, all recalled by participants in relation to personal experiences of the Anti-ELAB. The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay.

    "content": "arXiv:2509.12752v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI's transformative impact on work, education, and everyday life makes it as much a political artifact as a technological one. Current AI models are opaque, centralized, and overly generic. The algorithmic automation they provide threatens human agency and democratic values in both workplaces and daily life. To confront such challenges, we turn to Scandinavian Participatory Design (PD), which was devised in the 1970s to face a similar threat from mechanical automation. In the PD tradition, technology is seen not just as an artifact, but as a locus of democracy. Drawing from this tradition, we propose Participatory AI as a PD approach to human-centered AI that applies five PD principles to four design challenges for algorithmic automation. We use concrete case studies to illustrate how to treat AI models less as proprietary products and more as shared socio-technical systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency, human dignity, and human values.",

While many studies have shown the usefulness of large language models (LLMs) for qualitative analysis, their possibility in the data collection process remains underexplored. We adopt an AI-driven \"Wizard-of-Oz\" setup to investigate how real-time LLM support in generating follow-up questions shapes semi-structured interviews. Through a study with 17 participants, we examine the value of LLM-generated follow-up questions, the evolving division of roles, relationships, collaborative behaviors, and responsibilities between interviewers and AI. Our findings (1) provide empirical evidence of the strengths and limitations of AI-generated follow-up questions (AGQs); (2) introduce a Human-AI collaboration framework in this interview context; and (3) propose human-centered design guidelines for AI-assisted interviewing. We position LLMs as complements, not replacements, to human judgment, and highlight pathways for integrating AI into qualitative data collection.",

A built-in respondent simulation generates realistic scenarios, allowing users to rehearse, refine policies, and calibrate their reliance before live use. We evaluate DoubleAgents in a two-day lab study (n=10), two deployments (n=2), and a technical evaluation. Results show that participants initially hesitated to delegate but grew more reliant as they experienced transparency, control, and adaptive learning during simulated cases. Deployment results demonstrate DoubleAgents' real-world relevance and usefulness, showing that the effort required scaled appropriately with task complexity and contextual data. We contribute trust-by-design patterns and mechanisms for proactive AI -- consistency, controllability, and explainability -- along with simulation as a safe path to build and calibrate trust over time.",

We first conducted a need-finding study with 6 novices and 3 experts to understand how they utilize LLMs in DP implementation. While DP experts can implement correct DP analyses through a few prompts, novices struggle to articulate their requirements in prompts and lack the skills to verify the correctness of the generated code. We then developed DPCheatSheet, an instructional tool that helps novices implement DP using LLMs. DPCheatSheet combines two learning concepts: it annotates an expert's workflow with LLMs as a worked example to bridge the expert mindset to novices, and it presents five common mistakes in LLM-based DP code generation as erroneous examples to support error-driven learning. We demonstrated the effectiveness of DPCheatSheet with an error identification study and an open-ended DP implementation study.",

While contextual privacy policies (CPPs) present information at the point of risk, they may lack engagement and disrupt tasks. We propose Conflect, an interactive CPP for mobile apps, guided by a reflective thinking framework. Through three workshops with experienced designers and researchers, we constructed the design space of reflective thinking-based CPP design, and identified the disconnect between context and action as the most critical problem. Based on participants' feedback, we designed Conflect to use sidebar alerts, allowing users to reflect on contextualized risks and fostering their control. Our system contextually detects privacy risks, extracts policy segments, and automatically generates risk descriptions with 94.0% policy extraction accuracy on CPP4APP dataset and a 4.35s latency. A user study (N=28) demonstrated that Conflect improves user understanding, trust, and satisfaction while lowering cognitive load compared to CPPs, privacy policies and privacy labels.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.12525v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI powers a growing wave of companion chatbots, yet principles for fostering genuine connection remain unsettled. We test two routes: visible user authorship versus covert language-style mimicry. In a preregistered 3x2 experiment (N = 162), we manipulated user-controlled avatar generation (none, premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs. adaptive). Generating an avatar boosted rapport ($\\omega^2$ = .040, p = .013), whereas adaptive LSM underperformed static style on personalization and satisfaction (d = 0.35, p = .009) and was paradoxically judged less adaptive (t = 3.07, p = .003, d = 0.48). We term this an Adaptation Paradox: synchrony erodes connection when perceived as incoherent, destabilizing persona. To explain, we propose a stability-and-legibility account: visible authorship fosters natural interaction, while covert mimicry risks incoherence. Our findings suggest designers should prioritize legible, user-driven personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry.",

Using two weeks of interaction context collected from 38 users, we compare model responses with and without long-context for two tasks: political explanations and personal advice. Our results demonstrate how and when real-world interaction contexts can amplify AI mirroring behaviors. We find that sycophancy increases in long-context, irrespective of the interaction topics.

The ubiquity of egocentric eye-trackers and large-scale datasets on everyday interactions offer research opportunities in identifying JVA in multi-user environments. We propose a novel approach utilizing spatiotemporal tubes centered on attention rendered by individual gaze and detect JVA using deep-learning-based feature mapping. Our results reveal object-focused collaborative tasks to yield higher JVA (44-46%), whereas independent tasks yield lower (4-5%) attention. Beyond JVA, we analyze attention characteristics using ambient-focal attention coefficient K to understand the qualitative aspects of shared attention. Our analysis reveals $\\mathcal{K}$ to converge instances where participants interact with shared objects while diverging when independent. While our study presents seminal findings on joint attention with egocentric commodity eye trackers, it indicates the potential utility of our approach in psychology, human-computer interaction, and social robotics, particularly in understanding attention coordination mechanisms in ecologically valid contexts.",

Existing interfaces either impose rigid, step-by-step workflows or permit unguided free-form exploration. To strike a balance between flexibility and guidance for augmenting people's efficiency and creativity, we introduce a human-AI collaborative workflow that supports a fluid ideation process. The system surfaces three opt-in aids: (1) high-level schemas to uncover alternative ideas, (2) risk analysis with mitigation suggestions, and (3) steering system-generated suggestions. Users can invoke these supports at any moment, allowing seamless back-and-forth movement among design actions to maintain creative momentum.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.12383v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This chapter examines identity theft in the digital age, particularly in the context of emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It begins with a discussion of big data and selfhood, the concepts of data selves and data doubles, and the process of identification in the digital age. Next, the literature on online identity theft is reviewed, including its theoretical and empirical aspects. As is evident from that review, AI technologies have increased the speed and scale of identity crimes that were already rampant in the online world, even while they have led to new ways of detecting and preventing such crimes. As with any new technology, AI is currently fuelling an arms race between criminals and law enforcement, with end users often caught powerless in the middle. The chapter closes by exploring some emerging directions and future possibilities of identity theft in the age of AI.",

Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges, which we characterize as addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behaviour will emerge through optimizing related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for ANNs: systematic generalization, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss how large language models incorporate key aspects of this metalearning framework (namely, sequence prediction with feedback trained on diverse data), which helps to explain some of their successes on these classic challenges. Finally, we discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalizations.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.12873v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The simulation of whole-brain dynamics should reproduce realistic spontaneous and evoked neural activity across different scales, including emergent rhythms, spatio-temporal activation patterns, and macroscale complexity. Once a mathematical model is selected, its configuration must be determined by properly setting its parameters. A critical preliminary step in this process is defining an appropriate set of observables to guide the selection of model configurations (parameter tuning), laying the groundwork for quantitative calibration of accurate whole-brain models. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a framework that integrates two complementary tools: The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics, and the Collaborative Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) for analyzing the simulations using a set of standardized metrics. We apply this framework to a 998-node human connectome, using two configurations of the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model: one with the TVB default parameters, the other tuned using Cobrawap. The results reveal that the tuned configuration exhibits several biologically relevant features, absent in the default model for both spontaneous and evoked dynamics. In response to external perturbations, the tuned model generates non-stereotyped, complex spatio-temporal activity, as measured by the perturbational complexity index. In spontaneous activity, it displays robust alpha-band oscillations, infra-slow rhythms, scale-free characteristics, greater spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and asymmetric functional connectivity. This work demonstrates the potential of combining TVB and Cobrawap to guide parameter tuning and lays the groundwork for data-driven calibration and validation of accurate whole-brain models.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.12783v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge, we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times and then generates populations of \"twin\" neuron models that replicate the observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface, making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "Decoding how specific neuronal subtypes contribute to brain function requires linking extracellular electrophysiological features to underlying molecular identities, yet reliable in vivo electrophysiological signal classification remains a major challenge for neuroscience and clinical brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Here, we show that pretrained, general-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) can be repurposed as few-shot learners to classify neuronal cell types directly from electrophysiological features, without task-specific fine-tuning. Validated against optogenetically tagged datasets, this approach enables robust and generalizable subtype inference with minimal supervision. Building on this capability, we developed the BCI AI Agent (BCI-Agent), an autonomous AI framework that integrates vision-based cell-type inference, stable neuron tracking, and automated molecular atlas validation with real-time literature synthesis. BCI-Agent addresses three critical challenges for in vivo electrophysiology: (1) accurate, training-free cell-type classification; (2) automated cross-validation of predictions using molecular atlas references and peer-reviewed literature; and (3) embedding molecular identities within stable, low-dimensional neural manifolds for dynamic decoding. In rodent motor-learning tasks, BCI-Agent revealed stable, cell-type-specific neural trajectories across time that uncover previously inaccessible dimensions of neural computation. Additionally, when applied to human Neuropixels recordings - where direct ground-truth labeling is inherently unavailable - BCI-Agent inferred neuronal subtypes and validated them through integration with human single-cell atlases and literature. By enabling scalable, cell-type-specific inference of in vivo electrophysiology, BCI-Agent provides a new approach for dissecting the contributions of distinct neuronal populations to brain function and dysfunction.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of direct alignment between 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose images and a standard-space template",
    "content": "Group analyses in neuroimaging often require spatial normalisation. The most common approach for this involves the use of anatomical images as intermediate references. A lack of a usable anatomical image may then lead to a participant's data being excluded. This exclusion is a particular concern for challenging patient populations, such as those with movement disorders, and can introduce bias. We evaluated a direct alignment approach for 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) images to a simulated PET standard-space template, which would eliminate the need for an anatomical scan. The performance of this method was compared against the conventional T1-weighted image-based alignment using data from 40 participants with Alzheimer's disease and 47 healthy controls. Our results show that the direct alignment method performed as well as the conventional method in terms of image-template similarity. It also produced comparable region-of-interest (ROI) metabolic activity values and yielded more extensive and statistically significant group differences in a voxel-wise comparison of Alzheimer's patients versus healthy controls. The findings suggest that direct alignment is a robust and effective alternative for FDG-PET image normalisation.",

    "content": "The locus coeruleus (LC) plays a key role in stress response, attention, and cognitive function, with its integrity closely linked to neuromelanin accumulation. Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) has enabled in vivo imaging of the LC, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to its small size, low contrast, and anatomical variability. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of automatic LC segmentation using multi-atlas nonlinear warping applied to high-resolution T1/T2-weighted images and to compare LC intensity characteristics across NM-MRI, T1w, and T2w images. Additionally, we examined developmental changes in LC signal from childhood through adulthood. We analyzed MRI data from 134 participants (ages 8~64) with NM-MRI, T1w, and T2w scans, alongside 652 participants (ages 6~22) from the Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D). LC intensity measures were compared across imaging modalities and analyzed for age-related trends. Automatic LC segmentation achieved high spatial overlap with manual tracings (up to 95% after one voxel 2D-dilation). Statistically estimated high (or low)-intensity values (mean {+/-} 2 {sigma}) from automated LC masks provided a more stable and noise-resilient alternative to local peak intensity measures. Age-related LC signal changes are most clearly observed in NM-MRI and T2w imaging, with significant developmental shifts emerging during adolescence. These findings support the conventional T2w imaging as an indirect marker of neuromelanin accumulation and highlight the possibility of age-specific analyses in LC imaging studies.",

    "content": "During progressive nigrostriatal neuron loss in Parkinson disease (PD), compensatory mechanisms are thought to maintain dopamine (DA) signaling at levels sufficient to mitigate locomotor impairment prior to substantial neuron loss. Whereas increased DA turnover in striatum has been considered a keystone compensatory mechanism indicative of augmented DA signaling, recent work indicates that increased DA biosynthesis in substantia nigra (SN), not striatum, compensates for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein and neuronal loss. To extend interrogation of compensatory mechanisms that augment DA signaling during nigrostriatal neuron loss, we contemporaneously evaluated extracellular DA against tissue DA levels and quantified TH protein in the striatum and SN. Our unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion approach produces progressive neuronal loss between 7 and 28 days, enabling evaluation of multiple DA signaling components in striatum vs SN. Loss of TH was ~90% in striatum and ~70% in the SN by 7 days after lesion induction. However, whereas loss of tissue DA matched TH loss in striatum (>90%) on both days after lesion, tissue DA loss in SN occurred only at day 28 (36%), despite major TH loss by day 7. This preservation of nigral DA tissue levels during lesion progression was associated with increased extracellular DA in SN after K+-dependent depolarization in striatum, which was not evident in a sham-operation group at the same time, early after lesion induction, signifying a DA lesion-specific adaptation in SN. In contrast in the striatum, lesion abolished the robust increase in extracellular DA, as seen in the sham-operation group. Together, these results indicate compensatory mechanisms that augment nigrostriatal DA signaling are engaged in the SN, not striatum, during progressive nigrostriatal neuron loss.",

    "content": "Regular physical exercise is essential for promoting healthy aging and longevity. In older adults with varying physical and cognitive decline, optimising exercise interventions is crucial to maximise benefits. A promising approach to achieve this goal is by adjusting task demands to individual abilities in turn preventing over- or underloading their abilities. In the field of motor learning, it is currently unclear whether such an optimised training improves not only performance on the trained task but also transfers to untrained motor and cognitive tasks. We conducted a randomised, single-blinded, 6-week dynamic balance training (DBT) with healthy older adults (n=30). Training was tailored to individual balance ability. Participants were assigned to either suboptimal (high or low difficulty) or optimal (moderate difficulty) training groups. Transfer effects were assessed via cognitive tasks (memory and executive) and motor tasks (untrained DBT variations and other balance tasks) measured pre-, mid- and post-intervention. Multivariate longitudinal statistical analysis showed higher performance gains in the optimal training group in three out of six sessions compared to the suboptimal groups, especially under testing conditions with high task demands. The optimal group also showed greater improvements in near motor transfer tasks mid- and post-intervention, while no significant differences were observed in the cognitive tasks. Within-group DBT learning positively correlated with transfer gains, highlighting the role of training response in achieving transfer. In conclusion, optimised task difficulty in balance training enhances both task-specific performance and related motor skills, supporting the use of personalised interventions to maintain function and independence in older adults.",

    "content": "Multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, yet traditional image-based methods struggle in high-speed scenarios due to motion blur and temporal gaps caused by low frame rates. Spike cameras, with their ability to continuously record spatiotemporal signals, overcome these limitations. However, existing spike-based methods often rely on intermediate image reconstruction or discrete clustering, which limits their real-time performance and...",

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "content": "<p>Hey HN, we\u2019re Andrew and Derik at RunRL (<a href=\"https://runrl.com/\">https://runrl.com/</a>). We've built a platform to improve models and agents with reinforcement learning. If you can define a metric, we'll make your model or agent better, without you having to think about managing GPU clusters.<p>Here's a demo video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EtiBjs4jfCg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/EtiBjs4jfCg</a><p>I (Andrew) was doing a PhD in reinforcement learning on language models, and everyone kept...not using RL because it was too hard to get running. At some point I realized that someone's got to sit down and actually write a good platform for running RL experiments.<p>Once this happened, people started using it for antiviral design, formal verification, browser agents, and a bunch of other cool applications, so we decided to make a startup out of it.<p>How it works:<p>- Choose an open-weight base model (weights are necessary for RL updates; Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 is a good starting point)<p>- Upload a set of initial prompts (\"Generate an antiviral targeting Sars-CoV-2 protease\", \"Prove this theorem\", \"What's the average summer high in Windhoek?\")<p>- Define a reward function, using Python, an LLM-as-a-judge, or both<p>- For complex settings, you can define an entire multi-turn environment<p>- Watch the reward go up!<p>For most well-defined problems, a small open model + RunRL outperforms frontier models. (For instance, we've seen Qwen-3B do better than Claude 4.1 Opus on antiviral design.) This is because LLM intelligence is notoriously \"spiky\"; often models are decent-but-not-great at common-sense knowledge, are randomly good at a few domains, but make mistakes on lots of other tasks. RunRL creates spikes precisely on the tasks where you need them.<p>Pricing: $80/node-hour. Most models up to 14B parameters fit on one node (0.6-1.2 TB of VRAM). We do full fine-tuning, at the cost of parameter-efficiency (with RL, people seem to care a lot about the last few percent gains in e.g. agent reliability).<p>Next up: continuous learning; tool use. Tool use is currently in private beta, which you can join here: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/D2mSmeQDVCDraPQg8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forms.gle/D2mSmeQDVCDraPQg8</a><p>We'd love to hear any thoughts, questions, or positive or negative reinforcement!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45277704\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45277704</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

Recently, a new parameter of the posterior fossa (PF), known as the vermian-crest angle (VCA), has been evaluated using three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) and prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the performance of the VCA in categorizing PF anomalies using 3D-US and to determine its level of agreement with MRI.Study designWe conducted a cohort study involving confirmed cases of PF anomalies. We measured the VCA using 3D-US and compared our data with previously published reference values obtained through both 3D-US and MRI. For statistical analysis, we employed univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).ResultsWe identified 53 foetuses at a mean gestational age (GA) of 24.5 (SD 5.45) weeks with Blake\u2019s pouch cyst (BPC) (n =\u202f11), Dandy\u2013Walker malformation (DWM) (n =\u202f9), mega cisterna magna (MCM) (n =\u202f22), and vermian hypoplasia (VH) (n =\u202f11). Compared to published reference values, the VCA was significantly increased in DWMs (mean 130.6\u00b0, SD 16.75\u00b0; p \u2264\u202f0.01) and BPCs (mean 91.00\u00b0, SD 19.73\u00b0; p \u2264\u202f0.05). A VCA\u202f>\u202f80.1\u00b0 distinguished BPCs and DWMs from other PF anomalies, while a VCA\u202f>\u202f107\u00b0 differentiated BPCs from DWMs. When comparing subgroups with published MRI data, we found good agreement between 3D-US and MRI (ICC\u202f=\u202f0.71) (95% CI: 0.55\u20130.87).ConclusionThe VCA may be helpful in categorising PF anomalies using 3D-US, particularly BPC and DWM. The good agreement with MRI measurements reinforces the synergy of these tools in the diagnostic work-up.",

    "title": "Adrenergic signals influence proteomic responses in breast cancer cells",
    "content": "IntroductionBreast cancer remains a major health challenge due to its molecular heterogeneity and complex interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Adrenergic signaling, mediated by stress hormones such as noradrenaline, has emerged as a potential regulator of cancer progression, influencing cell proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, and invasion.MethodsThis study investigates the effects of adrenergic modulation on breast cancer spheroids from basal-like (MDA-MB-231, BT549) and luminal-like (T47D, MCF7) cell lines, using 3D culture systems as a more physiologically relevant model compared to traditional 2D monolayer cultures. The 3D spheroid model better recapitulates the structural complexity of tumors, providing insights into cell\u2013cell and cell-matrix interactions that influence signaling pathways and drug responses.ResultsNoradrenaline treatment significantly reduced spheroid size, invasion capacity, and the expression of EMT-related markers and integrins in MDA-MB-231 cells. These effects were partially reversed by propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Luminal-like spheroids, characterized by low ADRB2 abundance, displayed limited responsiveness to adrenergic modulation. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct subtype-specific responses, with basal-like spheroids showing pronounced alterations in pathways related to proliferation, cytoskeletal dynamics, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metabolism, whereas luminal-like spheroids exhibited minimal changes.DiscussionOur findings reveal heterogeneity in adrenergic receptor signaling across basal-like and luminal-like breast cancer cell lines, and also within the basal-like subgroup. This diversity underscores the complexity of adrenergic signaling in breast cancer and highlights the advantages of 3D culture systems. These results provide valuable insights into the subtype-specific patterns of response to adrenergic signaling that contribute to tumor progression and may inform future studies including evaluation of therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "An ICA-based artifact suppression method for online extraction of TMS-evoked potentials: toward closed-loop TMS-EEG applications beyond the motor cortex",
    "content": "Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has become a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, TMS-EEG signals often suffer from severe artifacts, particularly in lateral cortical regions where TMS-evoked muscle artifacts are pronounced, making real-time recovery of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) challenging. We developed and validated a real-time, two-step independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact cleaning method for TMS-EEG signals, facilitating the rapid extraction of clean neural signals for closed-loop neurostimulation applications. Approach. Our method involves an offline ICA training phase, where ICA weights and artifact topographies are identified using pre-experimental trials, followed by an online phase in which the precomputed weight matrices are applied in real-time to incoming data. We conducted simulations on two pre-published TMS-EEG datasets (N = 28, ROIs = 6) to validate the method by identifying the minimum number of trials required to estimate ICA weights. We also assessed the reproducibility of TEPs and the stability of ICA components, taking classical offline TEPs as the relative ground truth. Main Results. ICA analysis suggests that it can be applied reliably within each region without significant loss of convergence and stability, provided careful consideration is given to the size and composition of the data used for ICA training. Simulation results indicated that while central regions could achieve reliable TEPs similar to ground truth with as few as 20\u201330 trials to train ICA in the pre-experimental phase, frontal and occipital regions required 50\u201360 trials to reach a comparable level of reliability. Later TEP peaks (>100 ms) in all regions achieved high reproducibility when at least 35 training trials were used, whereas earlier peaks (<80 ms) showed moderate reproducibility with the same number of trials. Significance. These findings establish the feasibility and proof-of-concept for real-time ICA-based artifact removal for closed-loop TMS-EEG applications. The method enables rapid extraction of clean neural signals, allowing adaptation of stimulation parameters in real time, thereby facilitating individualized neurostimulation paradigms.",

    "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

    "content": "<p>A coalition of major record labels has filed a lawsuit against the Internet Archive\u2014demanding <strong>$700 million</strong> for our work preserving and providing access to historical 78rpm records. These fragile, obsolete discs hold some of the earliest recordings of a vanishing American culture. But this lawsuit goes far beyond old records. It\u2019s an attack on the Internet Archive itself.</p>\n<p>This lawsuit is an <strong>existential threat</strong> to the Internet Archive and everything we preserve\u2014including the <strong>Wayback Machine</strong>, a cornerstone of memory and preservation on the internet.</p>\n<p><strong>At a time when digital information is disappearing, being rewritten, or erased entirely, the tools to preserve history must be defended\u2014not dismantled.</strong></p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just about music.

    "title": "Sex-specific effects of fecal microbiota transplantation on TBI-exacerbated Alzheimer's pathology in mice",
    "content": "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accelerates Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neuroinflammation, potentially via gut-brain axis disruptions. Whether restoring gut microbial homeostasis mitigates TBI-exacerbated AD features remains unclear, particularly with respect to sex differences. Objective: The goal of our study was to test whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) modifies amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, gut microbial composition, metabolites, and motor outcomes in male and female 5xFAD mice subjected to TBI. Methods: Male and female 5xFAD mice received sham treatments or controlled cortical impact, followed 24 hours later by vehicle (VH) or sex-matched FMT from C57BL/6 donors. Assessments at baseline, 1, and 3 days post-injury included Thioflavin-S and 6E10 immunostaining for Abeta, Iba-1 and GFAP for glial activation, lesion volume, rotarod performance, 16S rRNA sequencing for microbiome profiling, serum short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and gut histology. Results: TBI increased cortical and dentate gyrus Abeta burden, with females showing greater vulnerability. FMT reduced Abeta deposition in sham animals and shifted plaque morphology but did not attenuate TBI-induced amyloid escalation. FMT differentially modulated glial responses by sex and region (reduced microgliosis in males) without altering lesion volume. Rotarod performance was better in sham females compared to males and declined in FMT-treated TBI females. Fecal microbiome alpha diversity and richness were unchanged, while beta diversity revealed marked, time-dependent community shifts after TBI that were slightly altered by FMT. Gut morphology remained broadly intact, but crypt width increased after TBI, particularly in males. Conclusion: In 5xFAD mice, TBI drives sex-dependent worsening of amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and dysbiosis. Acute FMT partially restores microbial composition and plaque features in sham animals but fails to reverse TBI-induced neuroinflammation or motor deficits. These findings underscore the context- and sex-dependence of microbiome interventions and support longer-term, sex-specific strategies for AD with comorbid TBI.",

    "content": "Introduction: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI+) results in latent changes in microRNA expression profiles across an episode of total sleep deprivation (TSD). Methods: Seven previously concussed (mTBI+) adults (24.5 y.o.) and 6 non-concussed control adults (mTBI-; 24.8 y.o.) underwent 24 h TSD (T2) preceded by 8 h baseline sleep (T1; BSL) and followed by 8 h recovery (T3; REC) sleep. Salivary microRNA expression was assessed across the entire study. Results: Subjects (mTBI+ and mTBI-) had differential expression of salivary microRNA targets across TSD. mTBI+ subjects had greater change to microRNA expression profiles compared to mTBI- subjects between T1 and T3. Discussion: Although there is some evidence that TSD may unmask latent changes in gene expression in mTBI+ subjects, a definitive conclusion was precluded by differences in baseline sleep in mTBI+ (vs. mTBI-) subjects measured through polysomnography (data not shown). However, this study is unique in that the mTBI+ subjects were exposed to a sleep deprivation challenge very shortly after medical clearance from mTBI demonstrating lingering neurobiological impacts of mTBI.",

    "title": "Building an Ecosystem of Seizure Localization Methods: Neural Fragility as the First Step",
    "content": "The current treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is surgical intervention, which relies on accurate identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) using intracranial EEG (iEEG) data. iEEG analysis with computational epileptogenic zone identification algorithms (CEZIAs) is a promising step towards better SOZ localization and surgical outcomes. A key step in validation and adoption of CEZIAs is to allow for widespread shared development and validation of code and data. We describe a set of three R packages to achieve this goal. Our ecosystem of seizure localization methods involves a straightforward analysis pipeline, standardized data formatting and storage, and completely documented and open-source code. The TableContainer package allows for easy storage and manipulation of table data, serving as groundwork for the Epoch package, which is specifically geared towards iEEG data. The Epoch package allows for cropping, resampling, and visualization of iEEG data and provides publicly downloadable iEEG data for reproducibility. Finally, the EZFragility package uses these two foundational packages to analyze iEEGs for SOZ localization using the Neural Fragility method described by Li et al. EZFragility was built using the same core principles as the original method but included several enhancements in computational efficiency and user experience. It accurately reproduces neural fragility results for both sample patients used in the original paper. This project serves as the first step towards building an open-source, reproducible ecosystem of seizure localization methods in R. Future steps include the addition of other CEZIAs using the framework and sample data already made available by these packages.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

    "title": "Spike-based time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model for extremely low power VLSI implementation of multi-layer neural networks",
    "content": "In deep neural network (DNN) models, the weighted summation, or multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation, is an essential and heavy calculation task, which leads to high power consumption in current digital processors. The use of analog operation in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits is a promising method for achieving extremely low power-consumption operation for such calculation tasks. In this paper, a time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model is proposed based on an integrate-and-fire-type spiking neuron model. The proposed calculation model is applied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with positive and negative weights are separately performed, and two timings proportional to the positive and negative ones are produced, respectively, in each layer. The timings are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction operation. We also propose VLSI circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low power consumption. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS circuit to verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights. Simulation results showed that the precision was above 4-bit, and the energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 237.7 Tera Operations Per Second Per Watt (TOPS/W), more than one order of magnitude higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors. Our model promises to be a suitable approach for performing intensive in-memory computing (IMC) of DNNs with moderate precision very energy-efficiently while reducing the cost of analog-digital-converter (ADC) overhead.",

    "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
    "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",

    "content": "Computing matrix gradient has become a key aspect in modern signal processing/machine learning, with the recent use of matrix neural networks requiring matrix backpropagation. In this field, two main methods exist to calculate the gradient of matrix functions for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, namely, the Dalecki\u01d0-Kre\u01d0n/Bhatia formula and the Ionescu method. However, there appear to be a few errors. This brief aims to demonstrate each of these formulas in a self-contained and...",

However, the field lacks a standardized evaluation metric, making it difficult to compare results across studies.

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

    "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
    "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

    "content": "IntroductionEnhancing the command capacity of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains a significant challenge in neuroinformatics, especially for real-world assistive applications. This study explores a multiclass BCI system designed to classify multiple MI tasks using a low-cost EEG device.MethodsA BCI system was developed to classify six mental states: resting state, left and right hand movement imagery, tongue movement, and left and right lateral bending, using EEG data collected with the Emotiv EPOC X headset. Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance. The results support the feasibility of scalable, multiclass MI paradigms in low-cost, user-centered neurotechnology applications, while pointing to critical areas for future system enhancement.",

    "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "IntroductionMultiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapid progression. Early diagnosis remains particularly challenging, especially when CASPR2 antibodies are detected during the early stages of disease progression.Case presentationA 56-year-old female presented with chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia. Serum analysis revealed the presence of CASPR2 antibodies. Brain MRI demonstrated atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum. The external anal-sphincter electromyography (EAS-EMG) indicated autonomic nerve dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. Despite treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, no clinical improvement was observed. During follow-up, symptoms of autonomic nerve dysfunction emerged, leading to a clinical established diagnosis of cerebellar subtype of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C).ConclusionIn the early stages of MSA, autonomic nerve dysfunction may not manifest clinically. Therefore, close follow-up is essential for accurate diagnosis. EAS-EMG exhibits high sensitivity in detecting subclinical autonomic dysfunction. Although the co-occurrence of MSA-C and high-titer (1:100) CASPR2-IgG is uncommon, this case highlights the critical importance of relying on the overall clinical presentation, rather than on isolated laboratory findings, to establish the primary diagnosis.",

All participants underwent the allocated intervention (active or sham rTMS over the prefrontal cortex) and completed standardized balance and proprioceptive assessments both pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the neuromodulatory effects on proprioceptive function in ACLR patients.

A promising variant is the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based BCI, which exploits information on hemodynamic brain activity evoked by performing different mental tasks. However, due to the sluggish nature of the hemodynamic response, a current challenge is to make these BCIs as efficient and fast as possible to allow useful...",
