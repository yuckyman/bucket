    "title": "The CHAT System: A Wearable Haptic System for Facilitating Tactile Communication",
    "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

    "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

    "title": "Closed-Loop Manual Control With Tactile or Visual Feedback Under Wireless Link Impairments",
    "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

    "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

    "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

    "title": "Insulin resistance alters cortical inhibitory neurons and microglia to exacerbate Alzheimer knock-in mouse phenotypes",
    "content": "Metabolic dysfunction contributes to the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through insulin signaling, but the cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency or a high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) diet-induced insulin resistance on cognitive function in knock-in AD mouse models expressing human mutant APP and wild-type tau. Both metabolic perturbations caused hyperglycemia, but only the HFHS diet resulted in weight gain and greater learning and memory deficits. The HFHS diet exacerbation occurred without changes in amyloid-{beta} or phospho-tau accumulation and with only subtle alterations in microglial morphology. The basis for functional deficits was explored with single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis. Prominent gene expression changes in glial cells and cerebral cortex Layer 2 inhibitory neurons correlated with the enhanced behavioral deficits. In HFHS-fed AD mice, we observed a shared metabolic impairment in neurodegeneration (MinD) state across multiple glial cell types. Additionally, the HFHS diet, with or without AD pathology, induced selective upregulation of the transcription factor Meis2 in cortical Layer 2 inhibitory neurons, in association with pathways involved in cell excitability. Overall, these findings suggest that HFHS-driven metabolic stress affects brain function and behavior through specific cellular programs distinct from amyloid or tau pathology, and identifies new targets that link diet-induced metabolic stress to cognitive decline in AD.",

    "title": "Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine Neural Activity Switches Simultaneously with Rule Representations in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus",
    "content": "<p>Multiple brain regions need to coordinate activity to support cognitive flexibility and behavioral adaptation. Neural activity in both the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to represent the spatial context and is sensitive to reward and rule alterations. Midbrain dopamine (DA) activity is key to reward-seeking behavior and learning. There is abundant evidence that midbrain DA modulates HPC and PFC activity. However, it remains underexplored how these networks engage dynamically and coordinate temporally when animals adjust their behavior according to changing reward contingencies. In particular, is there any relationship between DA reward prediction change during rule switching and rule representation changes in mPFC and CA1? We addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of neuronal population activity from the hippocampal area CA1, mPFC, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in male TH-Cre rats performing two spatial working memory tasks with frequent rule switches in blocks of trials. CA1 and mPFC ensembles showed rule-specific activity both during maze running and at reward locations, with mPFC rule coding more consistent across animals compared with CA1. Optogenetically tagged VTA DA neuron firing activity responded to and predicted reward outcome. We found that the correct prediction in DA emerged gradually over trials after rule switching in coordination with transitions in mPFC and CA1 ensemble representations of the current rule after a rule switch, followed by behavioral adaptation to the correct rule sequence. Therefore, our study demonstrates a crucial temporal coordination between the rule representation in mPFC/CA1, the dopamine reward signal, and behavioral strategy.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for higher-order cognitive functions, emotional responses, and monitoring internal states. ACC dysfunction has been implicated in an array of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders which have a bidirectional relationship with the metabolic disorder Type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, loss of insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, and increased morbidity and mortality chances. To better understand the functional effects of T2D on ACC information processing, we delivered an intermittent, low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) protocol to rats (all male due to female insensitivity to STZ) which led to lasting hyperglycemia and recorded single neurons during a delayed alternation task. We observed changes in spatial and reward processing in spite of no differences in overall behavioral accuracy, though we did find hyperglycemic animals spent less time at the reward site. Hyperglycemic animal (<i>n</i> = 5) ACC neurons had higher spatial information scores and changes in the allotment of spatial coding assets. Specifically, the hyperglycemic group had greatest spatial information during the reward approach, while in controls (<i>n</i> = 3) it was uniformly distributed. We found that state space separation and decoding accuracy were greater in control ensembles at the reward location. Furthermore, control hippocampal theta phase-locked cells had the strongest reward coding, and this effect was absent in hyperglycemic animals, leading to a muted reward location representation, despite increased reward approach coding. T2D inferred a nuanced and layered effect on ACC activity, leading to reward coding deficits, a reduced post-reinforcement pause, and a differential change in spatial coding properties.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule and ventral striatum (VC/VS) is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder (trOCD). DBS initiation often produces acute improvements in mood and energy. These acute behavioral changes, which we refer to as \"approach behaviors,\" include increased social engagement and talkativeness. We investigated the relationship between stimulation amplitude, spectral power in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and speech rate in one male patient with trOCD implanted with bilateral VC/VS DBS leads and subdural electrodes adjacent to the orbitofrontal cortex and vlPFC. Several times over the first 24&nbsp;weeks of therapy, we conducted experiments where we recorded data during epochs of high-amplitude or zero-/low-amplitude stimulation. We found that both the speech rate and vlPFC power in a high beta frequency band (31 &plusmn; 1.5&nbsp;Hz, 1/<i>f</i> activity removed) increased during high-amplitude as compared with low-amplitude periods. The speech rate correlated with vlPFC high beta power. These effects were more consistent across time points in the left hemisphere than the right. At Week 24, we performed an experiment where stimulation was held constant, while the patient was asked to speak or remain silent. We showed that the presence or absence of speech was not sufficient to increase the vlPFC high beta power, suggesting stimulation is a key driver of the observed neurobehavioral phenomenon. Our results suggest vlPFC high beta power is a biomarker for approach behaviors associated with VC/VS DBS.</p>",

However, the neural mechanisms driving these processes in primates remain unknown. To investigate how OFC and HPC contribute to state inference, we recorded simultaneously from both regions while two male monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) performed a probabilistic reversal learning task, where reward contingencies could be captured by two task states. Using population-level decoding, we found neural representations of task state in both OFC and HPC that remained stable within each trial but strengthened with learning as monkeys adapted to reversals. Subjects also appeared to use their understanding of task structure to anticipate reversals, evidenced by anticipatory neural representations of the upcoming task state.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Human and nonhuman primate studies suggest that timing and tempo of cortical development varies neuroanatomically along a sensorimotor-to-association (S&ndash;A) axis. Prior human studies have reported a principal S&ndash;A axis across various modalities but largely rely on cross-sectional samples with wide age ranges. Here, we investigate developmental changes and individual variability therein along the S&ndash;A axis between the ages of 9&ndash;13&nbsp;years using a large, longitudinal sample (<i>N</i> = 2,487&ndash;3,747; 46&ndash;50% female) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study). This work assesses multiple aspects of neurodevelopment indexed by changes in cortical thickness, cortical microarchitecture, and resting-state low&ndash;frequency oscillations. First, we evaluated S&ndash;A organization in age-related changes and then computed individual-level S&ndash;A alignment in brain changes and assessing differences therein due to age, sex, and puberty. Age-related brain changes aligned linearly and quadratically with the S&ndash;A axis. Yet, these patterns of cortical development were overshadowed by considerable individual variability in S&ndash;A alignment. Even within individuals, there was little correspondence between S&ndash;A patterning across the different aspects of neurodevelopment investigated (i.e., cortical morphology, microarchitecture, function). Some of the individual variation in developmental patterning of cortical morphology and microarchitecture was explained by age, sex, and pubertal development. Altogether, this work contextualizes prior findings that regional age differences do progress along an S&ndash;A axis at a group level while highlighting broad variation in developmental change between individuals and between aspects of cortical development, in part due to sex and puberty.</p>",

Early anatomical tracing studies investigated the organization of hippocampal inputs to the LS and its hypothalamic outputs to begin to understand how its structure might relate to its function. These studies also characterized the cellular anatomy of the LS and the organization of molecular markers within it. However, little is known about the organization of nonhypothalamic projection populations within the LS and what types of input these different projection populations receive. We used retrograde tracing to determine the organization of LS projections to six brain regions that mediate various social behaviors in male mice, specifically, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), nucleus accumbens (NAc), periaqueductal gray (PAG), ventromedial hypothalamus (vmH), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). We found that these projection populations occupy discrete anatomical compartments within the LS. We then used a monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy in male mice to map brainwide inputs to these six discrete LS projection populations and examine how different brain regions innervate them. We identified unique region-dependent patterns of inputs to individual LS projection populations. In particular, we observed differences in cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic innervation of the six different LS projection populations, while the hypothalamic inputs were largely similar across projection populations. Thus, this study provides insight into the anatomical connectivity that may underlie the functional heterogeneity of the LS.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Prediction errors (PEs) can enhance memory for preceding events. While such PE-related memory enhancements are critical for understanding adaptive memory, their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and neuro-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with multivariate pattern analysis, this preregistered study aimed to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying PE effects on memory. Specifically, we tested whether PEs trigger a neural reactivation of the preceding stimulus and whether the PE-induced effects on memory depend on the specific neural state before the PE. We also examined whether inhibitory TMS over the superior parietal cortex (SPC) reduces PE effects on memory. A total of 118 participants (male and female) received inhibitory theta-burst or sham stimulation over the SPC before completing an incidental encoding-fear learning task. In this task, participants learned trial-unique stimuli and predicted whether these would be followed by an electric shock, while EEG was recorded. Recognition memory was tested 24&nbsp;h later. Our findings show that signed PEs enhance subsequent memory, depending on theta and alpha oscillations as well as neural category reactivation shortly before the PE. Moreover, this memory enhancement was associated with post-PE theta but not with PE-driven category reinstatement. Theta-burst stimulation over the SPC led to a more conservative mnemonic response bias but left the PE effect on memory unaffected. Together, our findings reveal that PE effects on memory formation are influenced by neural states and representations surrounding the PE, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of adaptive memory formation.</p>",

In this study, we demonstrated that by reversing the age-related dysfunctions in M through activating the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the recovery after stroke in the aged brain could be improved. Using RNA-sequencing, we compared the transcriptomes between M isolated from the brains of young and aged male mice. We observed higher levels of proinflammatory genes and lower levels of phagocytosis-facilitating genes (<i>Cd206</i> and <i>Cd36</i>) expressed by aged M. Meanwhile, the treatment with RXR agonist bexarotene (BEX) reversed the signature genes of microglia aging in the aged M. With the in vivo phagocytosis model, we showed that BEX enhanced the phagocytic ability of aged M. Using the MCAo stroke model and male and female mice, we established that BEX improved sensorimotor and cognitive recovery after MCAo in a myeloid-RXR&alpha;&ndash;specific and myeloid-RXR&alpha;&ndash;dependent manner.

    "title": "Neural signatures of prioritization and facilitation in retrieving repeated items in visual working memory",
    "content": "Visual working memory (VWM) is a limited-capacity system where working memory items compete for retrieval. Some items are maintained in the working memory in the \u201cregion of direct access,\u201d which holds information readily available for processing, while other items are in a passive or activated long-term memory state and require cognitive control. Moreover, their recognition requires moving from the most active template in VWM to another one with the shift of attention. Stimulus properties based on similarity can link items together, which can facilitate their retrieval due to prioritization. To investigate the neural dynamics of differential processing of repeated versus not-repeated items in working memory, we designed a modified Sternberg task for testing recognition in a VWM-based EEG study where human participants respond to a probe for an item\u2019s presence or absence in the representation of an encoded memory array containing repeated and not repeated items. Significantly slower response times and comparatively poor accuracy for recognizing not-repeated items suggest that they are not prioritized. We identified specific differences in spectral perturbations for sensor clusters in the power of different frequency bands as the neural correlate of probe matching for not-repeated vs. repeated conditions, reflecting biased access to VWM items. For not-repeated item probe matching, delay in beta desynchronization suggests poor memory-guided action selection behavior. An increase in frontal theta and parietal alpha power demonstrated a demand for stronger cognitive control for retrieving items for not-repeated probe matching by shielding them from distracting repeated items. In summary, our study provides crucial empirical evidence of facilitation and prioritization of repeated items over non-repeated items and explains the probable role of different EEG rhythms in facilitated recognition of repeated items over goal-relevant, not-repeated items in VWM.",

Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

    "title": "Psychosocial factors associated with speech perception in older adult cochlear implant users: a scoping review",
    "content": "BackgroundThe population of older adults (OAs) is significantly increasing, and with that is the reality of OAs having hearing loss (HL). Although there is no hearing screening for adults, some OAs do consult their audiologist or otologist and receive a cochlear implant (CI). There are several studies showing that CI surgery in OAs is safe, and post-CI speech perception is similar to younger adults. However, there is little knowledge about what psychosocial factors may be associated with speech perception outcomes in OAs. The objective of this scoping review is to address these open questions.MethodsThis scoping review was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies in English and German published between Jan 2020 and Jan 2025 reporting on psychosocial factors relating to speech perception outcomes in OAs with CIs.Results6/94 studies met the inclusion criteria. The six included publications considered the associations of quality of life, frailty, depression, and family support on speech perception in OAs with CIs. The association between these factors and sound perception was variable.ConclusionAlthough CIs are not uncommon as a treatment for HL in OAs, few studies have addressed the associations of psychosocial factors with speech perception in this population, or vice versa. More research needs to be conducted to determine these psychosocial factors and their impact on speech perception to better care for OAs with CIs.",

    "title": "Distinct neurogenic dynamics of cortico-cortical neuronal subtypes in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex",
    "content": "In the mammalian cerebral cortex, the birthdates of excitatory projection neurons are closely linked to their laminar positions, which are often associated with distinct long-range projection targets. Although broad relationships between neurogenic timing, laminar position, and projection patterns are well established, the degree to which birthdate specifies projection identity within the same cortical layer remains unclear. In the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), neurons projecting to lateral higher visual areas are relatively evenly distributed throughout layer 2/3, whereas those projecting to medial areas are biased toward more superficial sublayers. To determine whether these projection identities are linked to neurogenic timing, we combined EdU birthdating with retrograde viral tracing. Notably, we found that V1 layer 2/3 neurons projecting to lateral higher visual areas are preferentially born at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) compared to E16.5, whereas V1 neurons projecting to medial higher visual areas show no significant birthdate bias between E15.5 and E16.5. These findings suggest that distinct cortico-cortical projection subtypes in layer 2/3 are generated on different temporal schedules, linking neurogenic timing to fine-scale projection identity.",

    "title": "Enhancing Human Navigation Ability Using Force-Feedback From a Lower-Limb Exoskeleton",
    "content": "Humans operating in dynamic environments with limited visibility are susceptible to collisions with moving objects, occupational hazards, and/or other agents, which can result in personal injuries or fatalities. Most existing research has focused on using vibrotactile cues to address this challenge. In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach that utilizes variable impedance on an active exoskeleton to guide humans away from hazards and towards safe areas. This framework combines artificial potential fields with current impedance-based theories of exoskeleton control to provide a comprehensive navigational system that is intuitive for human operators. First, we present the mathematical framework to encode information about the locations of obstacles and the safest direction in which to move. Next, we optimize controller parameters in a series of human-subject experiments. Finally, we evaluate the framework in virtual reality on a set of randomly generated obstacle fields in environments where vision is either fully or partially occluded. Our results suggest that the exoskeleton provides significant separation from obstacles and reduced collisions compared to vision alone in conditions where visibility was limited to less than 1.3 m. Our work demonstrates that force-feedback in parallel with a human can improve overall navigation ability in low visibility conditions.",

    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Optimization of Perceived Realism of Multi-Modal Haptic Rendering Under Conflicting Sensory Cues",
    "content": "During haptic rendering, a visual display and a haptic interface are commonly utilized together to elicit multi-sensory perception of a virtual object, through a combination and integration of force-related and movement-related cues. In this study, we explore visual-haptic cue integration during multi-modal haptic rendering under conflicting cues and propose a systematic means to determine the optimal visual scaling for haptic manipulation that maximizes the perceived realism of spring rendering for a given haptic interface. We show that the parameters affecting visual-haptic congruency can be effectively optimized through a qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization to ensure a consistently high rating of perceived realism. Accordingly, the multi-modal perception of users can be successfully enhanced by solely modulating the visual feedback without altering the haptic feedback, to make virtual environments feel stiffer or more compliant, significantly extending the range of perceived stiffness levels for a haptic interface. We extend our results to a group of individuals to capture the multi-dimensional psychometric field that characterizes the cumulative effect of feedback modalities utilized during sensory cue integration under conflicts. Our results not only provide reliable estimates of just noticeable difference thresholds for stiffness with and without visual scaling but also capture all the prominent features of sensory cue integration, indicating weights that are proportional to the congruency level of manipulated visual signals. Overall, preference-based HiL optimization excels as a systematic and efficient method of studying multi-modal perception under conflicts.",

    "content": "The growing need for human-machine interfaces (HMIs) underscores the importance of sensory feedback, with electrical stimulation offering efficient interaction in various applications. While its sensory effects are extensively studied, investigations into the reaction time (RT) following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate how stimulation parameters influence RT. We examined RT and RT variability among twenty healthy participants aged 21 to 61 years. Participants underwent 16 stimulation patterns (10 repetitions per pattern) with combinations of four pulse frequencies (4, 26, 48, 70 Hz) and four pulse amplitudes (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times of sensory threshold) on four skin locations in the lower leg above peroneal nerve, tibial nerve, tibialis anterior muscle, and a lateral shank control site. RT was assessed as participants dorsiflexed their foot in response to electrical stimulation. Results revealed that both RT and its variability decreased as pulse frequency and amplitude increased, and there was an interaction effect between pulse frequency and amplitude. However, no significant difference was found in RT across stimulation locations. These findings demonstrate how stimulation parameters affect the speed and efficiency of communication between the user and the stimulator, showing promises for augmenting real-time feedback HMIs.",

    "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
    "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",

    "content": "In multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm), achieving consistent imaging quality across all spectral channels is crucial for accurately identifying a wide range of fluorophores. However, these essential measurements are frequently compromised by saturation artifacts due to the inherently limited dynamic range of detection systems. To address this issue, we present SatCompFLImNet, a deep learning-based network specifically designed to correct saturation artifacts in multispectral FLIm, facilitating high dynamic range applications. Leveraging generative adversarial networks, SatCompFLImNet effectively compensates for saturated fluorescence signals, ensuring accurate lifetime measurements across various levels of saturation. Extensively validated with simulated and real-world data, SatCompFLImNet demonstrates remarkable capability in correcting saturation artifacts, improving signal-to-noise ratios, and maintaining fidelity of lifetime measurements. By enabling reliable fluorescence lifetime measurements under a variety of saturation conditions, SatCompFLImNet paves the way for improved diagnostic tools and a deeper understanding of biological processes, making it a pivotal advancement for research and clinical diagnostics in tissue characterization and disease pathogenesis.",

    "content": "This study investigates a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, aiming to develop a non-contact, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational solution for healthcare applications. A 60 GHz mmWave radar system was employed to collect radar point cloud data from 45 participants performing STS motions. Using a deep learning-based pose estimation model and Inverse Kinematics (IK), we calculated joint angles, segmented STS motions, and extracted clinically relevant features for fall risk assessment. The extracted features were compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. While Kinect provided a reference for motion capture, we acknowledge its limitations compared to the gold-standard VICON system, which is planned for future validation. The results demonstrated that mmWave radar effectively captures general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk), though challenges remain for more fine-grained motion analysis. This study highlights the unique advantages and limitations of mmWave radar and other sensors, emphasizing the potential of integrated sensor technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Future work will expand the scope to more complex movements and incorporate high-precision motion capture systems to further validate the findings.",

    "title": "Camera Seismocardiogram Based Monitoring of Left Ventricular Ejection Time",
    "content": "Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), reflecting the duration from the onset to the end of blood ejection by the left ventricle during each heartbeat, is a critical parameter for measuring cardiac pumping efficiency. Continuous and regular monitoring of LVET is particularly crucial in assessing cardiac health, valvular function, and myocardial contractility. Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can be utilized for LVET monitoring, as the temporal distance between the aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC) in SCG signals can accurately depict LVET. This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF. We validated the effectiveness of our AO and AC detection algorithm on a self-made dataset comprising 21 participants with 9616 SCG cycles. The benchmark shows that the detection accuracy for AO and AC reached 98.16% and 97.94%, respectively, with an mean absolute error of 0.5571 ms for LVET estimation. The results demonstrate that camera-SCG has strong potential for cardiac health monitoring.",

    "title": "Biophysical Modeling of Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering",
    "content": "The increasing demand for wearables necessitates efficient energy harvesting and wireless power transfer solutions. Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering (EQS-HBP) is a promising technology for wirelessly powering on-body devices, offering enhanced received power ($P_{rx}$) with full-body coverage. Unlike EQS Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which optimizes channel capacity, EQS-HBP focuses on maximizing ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, requiring a distinct biophysical model tailored to lower termination impedance ranges where ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ peaks. This paper presents comprehensive simulations\u2014finite element method (FEM), distributed circuit modeling\u2014and in-vivo experiments to characterize the body channel as a finite impedance wire, with impedance determined by body dimensions. Contact impedance between the body and receiver, inversely related to contact area, significantly affects ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, necessitating careful design for devices with small contact areas. Furthermore, the body cross-sectional area influences voltage recovery after the point of load, with smaller cross-sections yielding reduced recovery. A lumped circuit model is developed to encapsulate these findings with circuit techniques to maximize ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, demonstrating that series resonance in a ground-floated receiver reduces input impedance by over 65x and improves ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ by more than 25\u00d7 over parallel resonance. We also propose a method to approximate optimal loading impedance for various receiver configurations and analyze the impact of inductor Q factor. We prove that neither series nor parallel resonance can mitigate the transmitter return path capacitance. These insights enable the development of a much higher on-body wireless power transfer method, advancing wearable device technology for applications in healthcare, fitness, and beyond.",

Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "title": "The speech reception threshold can be estimated using EEG electrodes in and around the ear",
    "content": "Objective. Previous studies have demonstrated that the speech reception threshold (SRT) can be estimated using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), referred to as SRTneuro. The present study assesses the feasibility of using ear-EEG, which allows for discreet measurement of neural activity from in and around the ear, to estimate the SRTneuro. Approach. Twenty young normal-hearing participants listened to audiobook excerpts at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) whilst wearing a 66-channel EEG cap and 12 ear-EEG electrodes. A linear decoder was trained on different electrode configurations to estimate the envelope of the audio excerpts from the EEG recordings. The reconstruction accuracy was determined by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the actual and the estimated envelope. A sigmoid function was then fitted to the reconstruction-accuracy-vs-SNR data points, with the midpoint of the sigmoid serving as the SRTneuro estimate for each participant. Main results. Using only in-ear electrodes, the estimated SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the behaviorally measured SRT (SRTbeh) for 6 out of 20 participants (30%). With electrodes placed both in and around the ear, the SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants (95%) and thus on par with the reference estimate obtained from full-scalp EEG. Using only electrodes in and around the ear from the right side of the head, the SRTneuro remained within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants. Significance. These findings suggest that the SRTneuro can be reliably estimated using ear-EEG, especially when combining in-ear electrodes and around-the-ear electrodes. Such an estimate can be highly useful e.g. for continuously adjusting noise-reduction algorithms in hearing aids or for logging the SRT in the user\u2019s natural environment.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Estimating the Mean: Behavioral and Neural Correlates of Summary Representations for Time Intervals",
    "content": "Our behavior is guided by the statistical regularities in the environment. Prior research on temporal context effects has highlighted the dynamic processes through which humans adapt to the environment's temporal regularities. Whereas earlier approaches have focused on the adaptation to traces of previous individual events, real-world performance often requires extracting and retaining summary statistics (e.g., the mean) of temporal distributions. To investigate these summary representations for temporal distributions and to test their sensitivity to distributional changes, we explicitly asked participants to extract the mean of different distributions of time intervals, which shared the same mean but varied in their variability specifically operationalized by the width and presentation frequency of the intervals. Our findings showed that the variability of the estimated mean increased with the distributions' variability, even though the actual mean remained constant. We further examined how such learning of temporal distributions modulates EEG signals during subsequent temporal judgments. An analysis revealed that the contingent negative variation, predictive of single-trial RTs, was correlated with how much individuals' estimates of the mean were affected by the distributions' variability. Conversely, the postinterval P2 was not modulated by the distributions but predicted participants' responses, suggesting that P2 reflects the perceived duration of an interval. Taken together, our results demonstrate not only that humans can accurately estimate the mean of a temporal distribution but also that the representation of the mean becomes more uncertain as the variability of the distribution increases, as reflected neurally in the preparation-related contingent negative variation during temporal decisions.",

    "title": "The Role of Syntactic and Semantic Cues in Preventing Temporary Illusions of Plausibility",
    "content": "Unexpected words within a context elicit large N400 brain potentials. However, sometimes the N400 at an unexpected word is small when stereotypical agent and patient roles are reversed, such as at \u201carrested\u201d in \u201cthe cop that the thief arrested.\u201d In a study of 74 native German speakers, we demonstrate evidence that readers can avoid this so-called N400 semantic illusion if the verb is delayed with neutral information such as \u201cthat evening,\u201d but are less able to do so if the delay contains cues that could further strengthen the canonical interpretation, such as \u201cwith handcuffs.\u201d In doing so, we provide a conceptual replication of a relatively new finding and extend previous research by showing that the semantic content of the delay is important. Moreover, we demonstrate evidence that the effect of only the neutral delay increases as the experiment progresses. We propose an interpretation of these findings with reference to the Sentence Gestalt model [Rabovsky, M., Hansen, S. S., & McClelland, J. L. Modelling the N400 brain potential as change in a probabilistic representation of meaning. Nature Human Behaviour, 2, 693, 2018], which accounts for the initial illusion as resulting from uncertainty and an erroneous interpretation based on a strong semantic attractor. Two additional, novel contributions of the work are a demonstration that the illusion can be elicited in German, despite its explicit subject\u2013object case marking, and an exploration of illusion effect among individual readers.",

    "title": "Do Corollary Discharges Contain Information About the Volume of Inner Speech? An ERP Study",
    "content": "When we move our articulator organs to produce overt speech, the brain generates a corollary discharge that acts to suppress the neural and perceptual responses to our speech sounds. Recent research shows that inner speech\u2014the silent production of words in one's mind\u2014is accompanied by a corollary discharge that contains information about the timing and content of inner speech. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this corollary discharge contains information about the volume of inner speech. To investigate this, participants watched an animation that provided them with precise knowledge about when they should produce a \u201cloud\u201d or \u201cquiet\u201d inner sound. At the same time, they heard an audible sound that was either similar or dissimilar to the volume of the inner sound. We found that producing the inner sound attenuated the N1\u2014an ERP signature of auditory processing\u2014and enhanced the slow negative wave\u2014an ERP signature of anticipation and motor preparation\u2014compared with listening, regardless of whether the volume of the inner sound was similar or dissimilar to the audible sound. We also found that the volume of the inner sound did not differentially modulate the N1 or slow negative wave. We speculate that this might be because one of the functions of corollary discharge is to protect our auditory receptors from desensitization caused by audible sounds, and this might be redundant in the context of inner speech because inner speech does not produce an audible sound. We conclude that there might be a functional difference between the neural processes that underlie the production of inner and overt speech.",

    "content": "Contralateral delay activity (CDA) is a measure used to assess the amount of information being stored in visual working memory (VWM). However, it has also been suggested that CDA reflects the current focus of spatial attention, as seen in the multiple object tracking task. This study aimed to determine whether the CDA observed in the multiple object tracking task is driven by VWM storage demands, potentially stemming from the feature (cue) masking of target features. To test this, we manipulated whether participants needed to remember the tracked items under masked or unmasked conditions during the tracking phase. Our experiment revealed that CDA occurred in both conditions; the amplitude of CDA was sensitive to the tracking load only in the masked condition. These findings suggest that CDA reflects both sustained attentional activation and representational storage, with the tracking load influencing CDA only when storage in VWM is required. These results support the conclusion that CDA is primarily sensitive to VWM storage rather than the current focus of spatial attention.",

    "title": "Theta Stimulation Enhances Early Consolidation of Semantic Memory",
    "content": "This study investigates the role of theta frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in enhancing the consolidation of newly acquired semantic knowledge. Although postencoding theta oscillatory power increase has been reported to benefit episodic memory consolidation, its influence on semantic memory retention has not been examined. In this experiment, 175 participants were taught fundamental immunology concepts and were then randomly assigned to receive either theta or beta tACS, applied through midline frontal, left parietal, or bilateral parietal montages, or sham stimulation as a passive control condition. Memory for that newly acquired knowledge was assessed before and shortly after the intervention, 24 hr later, and 1 week later, to evaluate both acute and longer-lasting effects of the stimulation. Results indicated that theta tACS significantly enhanced memory consolidation compared with both sham and beta conditions, especially when applied using a parietal montage targeting the area of the left angular gyrus. The resulting improved performance was consistent across all stages of assessment, indicating a robust effect of postencoding theta stimulation on the persistence of semantic memory. This suggests that some processes and substrates of early memory consolidation are common to episodic and semantic memories. These findings hold practical implications for educational and therapeutic contexts, suggesting that theta tACS might be used to reinforce learning, in both healthy and memory-challenged individuals.",

    "content": "The current study investigates whether changes in scalp electroencephalographic activity over time reflect the effects of target detection and divided attention on memory encoding. We recorded electroencephalographic activity in 61 young adults as they memorized lists of words either under full attention (single-task) or while performing a secondary task (dual task). In both cases, colored squares appeared with each word. However, in the dual-task condition, participants also pressed a button when the colored squares were in a predefined color (target) but made no response when the squares were in a different color (distractor). Subsequent memory effects in the alpha (8\u201312 Hz) and high gamma (50\u2013100 Hz) frequency bands changed throughout the trial, and these effects differed across conditions. Before word presentation, high gamma activity was associated with encoding success in the target and single-task conditions, but not in the distractor conditions. In contrast, alpha band activity decreased following word presentation, and these decreases were greater for successfully encoded words in the target condition than in the distractor or single-task conditions. The results are consistent with the view that alpha and gamma activity reflect distinct neural processes, which both contribute to memory formation, but are differentially sensitive to task demands and momentary shifts in attention.",

    "title": "The Impact of Auditory Distraction on Visual Memory Encoding in Middle-aged and Older Adults: A High-density Electroencephalography Study",
    "content": "Multitasking is essential for facing the complexity of everyday life environments, where the simultaneous processing of multiple information streams is ubiquitous, and it often requires an increased deployment of attentional resources to manage concurrent tasks. The physiological cognitive decline associated with aging further depletes cognitive resources, making it important to investigate the impact of aging on multitasking abilities, particularly in relation to the mnestic domain. To this aim, we investigated the impact of auditory distraction on visual memory encoding in older adults using high-density electroencephalography. Fifty healthy adults aged 48\u201372 yearscompleted a dual-task paradigm, combining visual memory encoding with an auditory sustained attention task. Behavioral performance was analyzed alongside neural correlates measured through ERPs and theta synchronization during high-density electroencephalography recordings. Participants demonstrated a decline in visual memory recognition performance under the more demanding dual-task condition, but with a stable cost across age. Increasing age negatively impacted overall performance but also subjective confidence. Neurophysiological data showed larger subsequent memory effect amplitudes and increased theta synchronization during dual-tasking, suggesting greater item-specific encoding. Source localization identified the left orbitofrontal and superior temporal gyri as well as the right opercular gyrus as key regions involved in memory encoding under distraction. Increased theta power at rest correlated with worse task performance in older adults, suggesting that neural processing efficiency declines with age. These findings highlight how multitasking interferes with memory encoding in adults, with significant neural recruitment to compensate for dual-task demands.",

    "title": "Misprediction Sensitivity Is Diminished for Action-effects Resulting from Stimulus-driven Movement",
    "content": "While volitional movement is thought to be initiated based on its anticipated capacity to achieve sensory goals, stimulus-driven movement may be generated with less regard for its specific effects. Sensorimotor processes that make use of action-effect predictions may therefore differ between these forms of movement, including sensory attenuation and the detection of mispredicted motor effects. In this study, we explored sensory attenuation by comparing the evoked response of externally-generated tones with those produced by participants (n = 61), both according to their own timing (i.e., volitionally) and in response to simple visual cues (i.e., stimulus-driven). The influence of stimulus identity prediction (i.e., the predictability of tone frequency) on N1 amplitudes was not found to differ between self- and externally-generated stimuli, or on the basis of volitional control. Reduced P2 amplitudes were observed in response to self-generated tones, which may suggest that these were subject to higher levels of attentional control, including processes involved in the termination of attention. To explore misprediction sensitivity, we compared the influence of stimulus identity prediction on N2b component amplitudes. A significant interaction was found to reflect heightened sensitivity to mispredicted outcomes of volitional action, compared with those of stimulus-driven movement. In light of recent evidence that attentional suppression may attenuate the primary cortical response to outcomes of stimulus-driven movement, we propose that this mechanism might also serve to diminish misprediction sensitivity. As such, these effects may represent important features of sensorimotor processing that assist in differentiating stimuli on the basis of self-generation and intentionality.",

    "content": "Psychological stress impairs cognition, forcing attention toward stressor-related information. However, stress may reallocate limited cognitive resources in adaptive ways. How stress modulates the attentional control remains unclear. In this study, the stress-related changes in both target processing and distractor interference were investigated in Experiment 1, where an additional singleton task was employed with a stress group and a control group. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with both stress responses and attentional control. The role of the left DLPFC in regulating attention control under stress was investigated using repetitive TMS in Experiment 2, which included control-vertex, stress-vertex, and stress-DLPFC groups. Electroencephalography was recorded. The results showed that (1) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited increased RT attentional capture effect and greater distractor-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, indicating increased distractor interference under stress; (2) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited a greater target-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, suggesting enhanced target processing under stress; and (3) compared with the stress-vertex group, the stress-DLPFC group exhibited greater target-elicited N2pc effect, but a similar distractor-elicited N2pc effect, suggesting that left-DLPFC stimulation improved target processing but exerted no influence on distractor processing. In addition, faster RTs, along with a reduced RT attentional capture effect, were found for the stress-DLPFC group, implying that the target processing following left-DLPFC stimulation might be less affected by the distractor due to the heightened target processing. The left DLPFC may play a crucial role in modulating attentional control under stress.",

    "title": "A Role of Pupil-linked Arousal, Cingulo-insular Cortex, and Intralaminar Thalamus for Auditory Near-threshold Perception",
    "content": "The perception of near-threshold tones varies strongly across trials, likely because of fluctuations in sustained attention or arousal. We used parallel fMRI and pupillometry to study the role of attention networks for the detection of near-threshold tones in three phases: (1) passive listening, (2) active detection of salient tones, and (3) active detection of near-threshold tones. Results confirmed previous findings from magnetoencephalography that auditory cortex activity and pupil-dilation responses for near-threshold tones were only observed when task-relevant, stronger for hit trials, but also present for miss trials. We then sought which attention-related areas show a similar response pattern, and found it in insular cortex, anterior midcingulate cortex, and inferior precentral sulcus. Moreover, activity in the insula was already stronger for hit than miss trials in the prestimulus interval. Activity for hit trials was also observed in a number of subcortical nuclei, including thalamus, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, and the colliculi. Like insula, activity in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus additionally showed activity for miss trials and stronger activity for hit trials in the baseline. Finally, BOLD activity correlated to spontaneous pupil fluctuations was evaluated and revealed biphasic activation and deactivation in a widespread cortical network, with a maximum 3 sec and minimum 7 sec after pupil dilation. The cortical networks included insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, retro-splenial, and sensory cortex. Overall, these data identify the cingulo-insular network and the intralaminar thalamic nuclei as potential sources of fluctuations in auditory cortex activity in the context of near-threshold tone detection.",

    "content": "Background and purposeDiabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common concomitant disease of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events (post-MACEs) may diminish the surgical benefits of patients with ICH. However, evidence regarding the impact of DM on post-MACEs remains limited.MethodsThis was a multicenter cohort study that enrolled ICH patients presenting to eight neurosurgery departments between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. Patients were categorized into DM group and no diabetes mellitus (nDM) group, based on the presence or absence of DM. Intergroup comparisons were performed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact of DM on post-MACEs and 30-days mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. A stratified analysis was also conducted based on the type of post-MACEs.ResultsA total of 688 ICH patients were included in the study, of whom 576 (83.7%) were classified into the nDM group and 112 (16.3%) into the DM group. Compared with the nDM group, the DM group exhibited significantly higher incidences of overall post-MACEs (28.6%), ischemic post-MACEs (14.3%), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (23.2%), and 30-days mortality (9.8%). After adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, alcohol, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, antiplatelet therapy, and intraventricular hemorrhage, DM remained a significant predictor of overall post-MACEs (OR: 1.790, 95%CI: 1.072\u20132.990, p\u202f=\u202f0.026), ischemic post-MACEs (OR: 2.139, 95%CI: 1.090\u20134.197, p\u202f=\u202f0.027), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (OR: 1.778, 95%CI: 1.015\u20133.114, p\u202f=\u202f0.044), and 30-days mortality (OR: 3.593, 95%CI: 1.536\u20138.406, p\u202f=\u202f0.003).ConclusionIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that DM serves as a significant risk factor for ischemic post-MACEs, hemorrhagic post-MACEs, and 30-days mortality among patients with ICH.",

This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of data from a wide range of literature in this field to enhance the in-depth understanding of this area.MethodsPublications were retrieved from the 2000\u20132025 Web of Science Core Collection on January 21, 2025. Bibliometrix-package of R, VOSviewer and CiteSpace were used to visualize the research focus and trends.ResultsThe number of citations for the top 100 articles ranged from 208 to 602 citations, with a median of 293 and an average of 331.67 citations per article. The author with the most contributions to this collection was Holtzman David M, who authored 7 papers. Most articles originated in the United States (n\u202f=\u202f69), while Washington University was the institution with the most cited manuscripts (n\u202f=\u202f40). The Journal of Neuroscience contributed the most publications (n\u202f=\u202f15), followed by Nature Neuroscience (n\u202f=\u202f7).

    "content": "arXiv:2509.07009v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs, taking into account their biological or existential significance for an intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of the model is also provided.",

    "title": "Minimizing the influence of magnetic vestibular stimulation inside MRI-scanners by adjusting head position",
    "content": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers detailed diagnostic insights but also unintentionally induces vestibular side effects by its static magnetic field. Magnetic vestibular stimulation (MVS) may cause dizziness and confound behavioral and physiological measures in fMRI by introducing an unavoidable mixture of neural activation in vestibular projection areas, driven both by the signal of interest and by vestibular system activation. This study investigated how different head orientations within a 3T MRI scanner influence the MVS-induced vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in complete darkness, with the goal of identifying a head position that minimizes or eliminates MVS effects. Results revealed a linear relationship between head pitch and the horizontal VOR (Experiment 1), as well as between head roll and the vertical VOR (Experiment 2). Across participants, the horizontal VOR was eliminated at an average forward head pitch of 24.4 degree, while the vertical VOR was nullified at an average roll angle of 15.9 degree towards the right shoulder. A head position combining this forward pitch with this rightward roll effectively minimized both horizontal and vertical VOR components across subjects (Experiment 3). The findings provide a practical solution to reduce the impact of MVS effects in MRI with important implications for improving data quality in neuroscientific fMRI studies and patient comfort during clinical imaging.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "title": "[ANNOUNCEMENT] pychub: A new way to ship your Python wheels + deps + extras",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey fellow deveopers! </p> <p>I built a packaging tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/Steve973/pychub\"><strong>pychub</strong></a> that might fill a weird little gap you didn\u2019t know you had. It came out of me needing a clean way to distribute Python wheels <em>with</em> all of their dependencies and optional extras, but <em>without</em> having to freeze them into platform-specific binaries like PyInstaller does. And if you want to just install everything into your own current environment? That's what I wanted, too.</p> <h1>So what is it?</h1> <p><strong>pychub</strong> takes your wheel, resolves and downloads its dependencies, and wraps everything into a single executable <code>.chub</code> file. That file can then be shipped/copied anywhere, and then run directly like this:</p> <pre><code>python yourtool.chub </code></pre> <p>It installs into the current environment (or a venv, or a conda env, your call), and can even run an entrypoint function or console script <em>right after</em> install.</p> <p>No network calls. No pip. No virtualenv setup. Just <code>python tool.chub</code> and go.</p> <h1>Why I built it:</h1> <p>Most of the Python packaging tools out there either:</p> <ul> <li>Freeze the whole thing into a binary (PyInstaller, PyOxidizer) \u2014 which is great, until you hit platform issues or need to debug something. Or you just want to do something different than that.</li> <li>Just stop at building a wheel and leave it up to you (or your users) to figure out installation, dependencies, and environment prep.</li> </ul> <p>I wanted something in between: still using the host Python interpreter (so it stays light and portable), but with everything pre-downloaded and reproducible.</p> <h1>What it can bundle:</h1> <ul> <li>Your main wheel</li> <li>Any number of additional wheels</li> <li>All their dependencies (downloaded and stored locally)</li> <li>Optional include files (configs, docs, whatever)</li> <li>Pre-install and post-install scripts (shell, Python, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>And it\u2019s 100% reproducible, so that the archive installs the exact same versions every time, no network access needed.</p> <h1>Build tool integration:</h1> <p>If you're using <strong>Poetry</strong>, <strong>Hatch</strong>, or <strong>PDM</strong>, I\u2019ve released plugins for all three:</p> <ul> <li>Just add the plugin to your <code>pyproject.toml</code></li> <li>Specify your build details (main wheel, includes, scripts, etc.)</li> <li>Run your normal build command and you\u2019ll get a <code>.chub</code> alongside your <code>.whl</code></li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s one of the easiest ways to ship Python tools that <em>just work,</em> whether you're distributing internally, packaging for air-gapped environments, or dropping into Docker builder stages.</p> <p>Plugins repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins\">https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins</a></p> <h1>Why not just use some other bundling/packaging tool?</h1> <p>Well, depending on your needs, maybe you should! I don\u2019t think pychub replaces everything. It just solves a different problem.</p> <p>If you want sealed apps with bundled runtimes, use PEX or PyOxidizer.<br /> If you're distributing scripts, zipapp is great.<br /> But if you want a <strong>wheel-based</strong>, network-free, single-file installer that works on any Python 3.9+ environment, then pychub might be the right tool.</p> <p>Full comparison table along with everything else:<br /> \ud83d\udcd8 <a href=\"https://github.com/Steve973/pychub#why-not-just-use-insert-favorite-tool-name-here\">README on GitHub</a></p> <p>That\u2019s it. I built it because I needed it to include plugins for a platform that I am building. If it helps you too, even better. I will be actively supporting this, and if you would like to take it for a spin and see if you like it, I'd be honored to hear your feedback. If you want a feature added, etc, please let me know.<br /> Issues, suggestions, and PRs are all welcome.</p> <p>Thanks for your time and interest!</p> <p>Steve</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Steve91973\"> /u/Steve91973 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nds31l/announcement_pychub_a_new_way_to_ship_your_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nds31l/announcement_pychub_a_new_way_to_ship_your_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",

    "title": "Is there a link between motor learning and mirror neuron system: TMS study",
    "content": "BackgroundThe mirror neuron system (MNS) activates during the performance of an action and during the observation of the same action being performed by another. At the motor output level, MNS activation manifests as motor resonance, or a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focuses on how and to what extent motor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of motor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years on average. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was performed to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation under various conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions), motor learning was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task.ResultsWe observed a statistically significant decrease in reaction time during the process of learning within the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting putative mirror neuron activity. We found a significant correlation between the learning speed of the non-dominant hand and mirror neuron activation in the dominant hemisphere during the observation of button presses and pinch gestures.ConclusionThe MNS excitability is not a predictor of motor learning, but motor learning is reflected in the characteristics of the MNS.",

    "title": "Differences in dynamic functional connectivity between naturalistic music listening and rest in preadolescents",
    "content": "IntroductionEngagement with music is a significant aspect of adolescents' lives and this interest blossoms during preadolescence. Compared to the extensive body of research focused on adult music brain function, relatively few studies have examined the neural connections involved in music listening among adolescents and preadolescents. This study aims to investigate the dynamic patterns of brain functional connectivity and the transition processes during naturalistic music listening in preadolescents, measuring the transition of brain states from one time point to the next.MethodsWe employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity of 24 healthy preadolescents aged 8 to 12 years during both music listening and rest conditions. Subsequently, we applied a dynamic functional connectivity analysis, Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), to extract distinct brain states (phase locking patterns) and the corresponding transition processes.ResultsFindings show that occipital brain regions are actively engaged during music listening, possibly linked to attention regulation, visual imagery, and emotional processing. Additionally, we observed a more frequent transition from the default mode network (DMN) state to an orbitofrontal limbic state during music listening, evidencing cognitive shifts that facilitate emotional and reward processing. In contrast, during rest, we obtained a switch to the sensorimotor auditory network, suggesting intrinsic fluctuations in multiple networks.DiscussionThese findings deepen our understanding of subcortical and frontal brain connectivity in preadolescents during music listening, with implications for integrating music into educational practices to support learning and cognitive development.",

    "content": "In recent years, the role of Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) in neurological diseases has attracted increasing attention. As a probiotic, A. muciniphila is closely associated with host health, metabolism, and immunity, demonstrating therapeutic potential in various conditions such as obesity, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and liver disorders. In the context of neurological diseases, A. muciniphila significantly influences the host brain through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA). This review summarizes the roles and mechanisms of A. muciniphila and its active components (e.g., the outer membrane protein Amuc_1100, extracellular vesicles AmEVs, and short-chain fatty acids SCFAs) in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), depression, cerebral palsy (CP), epilepsy (EP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It exerts protective effects by enhancing the intestinal barrier, regulating lipid metabolism, producing SCFAs, secreting neuroactive substances, and inhibiting neuroinflammation, thereby suggesting novel therapeutic avenues for neurological disorders. However, due to limited data from large-scale human clinical trials and the complexity of disease mechanisms and host\u2013microbiota interactions, its clinical translation faces considerable challenges. Future efforts should focus on multicenter randomized controlled trials and in-depth mechanistic studies utilizing technologies such as metabolomics to facilitate evidence-based clinical application.",

    "title": "Prognostic impact of collateral circulation in direct thrombectomy versus bridging thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion: a retrospective comparative study",
    "content": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the prognostic impact of collateral circulation on outcomes of direct thrombectomy (DT) versus bridging thrombectomy (BT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO).MethodThis retrospective study included 460 AIS patients with anterior circulation LVO who underwent either DT (n\u202f=\u202f220) or BT (n\u202f=\u202f240). Collateral status was assessed using multiphase computed tomographic angiography. The primary outcome was functional prognosis at 3\u202fmonths, measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Prognostic factors for good prognosis (90-day mRS\u202f\u2264\u202f2) and adverse events were identified through multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.ResultsThe BT group had significantly higher rates of intracerebral hemorrhage and hemorrhagic transformation compared to the DT group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Good collateral circulation was independently associated with good prognosis and lower risk of serious adverse events (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Lower NIHSS scores, shorter OTR, absence of atrial fibrillation, and lower serum BNP levels were also significantly associated with favorable outcomes in AIS patients (all p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Elevated serum BNP levels increased the risk of serious adverse events in both DT and BT groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). ROC analysis showed that a combined model including NIHSS, BNP, collateral circulation, onset-to-reperfusion time, and atrial fibrillation achieved high predictive performance for good prognosis (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.907, 95% CI: 0.881\u20130.934, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).ConclusionCollateral circulation is a strong predictor of both functional recovery and risk of adverse events in AIS patients undergoing thrombectomy, regardless of treatment strategy. While serum BNP may offer additional prognostic value, its moderate performance and overlap with cardiovascular conditions suggest that it should be interpreted cautiously. Pre-intervention collateral assessment remains a valuable tool for guiding individualized treatment decisions.",

    "title": "Assessing consciousness in patients with locked-in syndrome using their EEG",
    "content": "Research indicates that locked-in syndrome (LIS) patients retain both consciousness and cognitive functions, despite their inability to perform voluntary muscle movements or communicate. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) provide a means for these patients to communicate, which is crucial, as the ability to interact with their environment has been shown to significantly enhance their wellbeing and quality of life. This paper presents an innovative approach to analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data from four LIS patients to assess their consciousness levels, referred to as normalized consciousness levels (NCL) in this study. It consists of extracting different features based on frequency, complexity, and connectivity measures to maximize the probability of correctly determining the patients' actual states given the inexistence of ground truth. The consciousness levels derived from this approach aim to improve our understanding of the patients' condition, which is vital in order to build effective communication systems. Despite considerable inter-patient variability, the findings indicate that the approach is effective in detecting neural markers of consciousness and in differentiating between states across the majority of patients. By accurately assessing consciousness, this research aims to improve diagnosis in addition to determining the optimal time to initiate communication with these non-communicative patients. It is important to note that consciousness is a complex and difficult concept to define. In this study, the term \u201cconsciousness level\u201d does not refer to a medical definition. Instead, it represents a scale of NCL values ranging from 0 to 1 representing the likelihood of the patient being fully conscious (1) or not (0).",

    "title": "Mutant mouse models implicate a role for mGluR1/5, prolyl isomerase (Pin1) and Homer1a interactions in wakefulness",
    "content": "IntroductionHealthy sleep and wake are integral to good health and occur when an organism is able to maintain long bouts of both sleep and wakefulness. Homer proteins have been shown to be important for sleep in both Drosophila and mice. For example, genetic deletion of Homer1a in mice results in failure to sustain long bouts of wakefulness. Homer1a has also been shown to amplify mGluR activity by facilitating binding of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 to mGluR. This study uses mouse models to evaluate whether the Homer1a null sleep phenotype may be dependent on the mGluR-Pin1 interaction and examines sleep/wake behavior.MethodsEEG recordings were used to determine and compare sleep and wake in three different mouse models and their littermate control mice. Mouse models included: mGluR(TS-AA) knock-in mice in which Pin1 binding is prevented and activity-dependent prolyl isomerization of mGluR is inhibited; mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice in which Homer binding is eliminated but Pin1 binding is allowed; and a Homer1a null, mGluR(F-R) double mutant mouse to evaluate whether Pin1 binding can rescue the Homer1a knock-out phenotype. Sleep-wake behavior was analyzed using traditional summary measures and a spike-and-slab mixture distribution to better characterize microarchitecture.ResultsKnock-in mGluR(TS-AA) mice display a reduced ability to sustain long bouts of wakefulness during the active lights off period, recapitulating part of the previously observed wake phenotype of the Homer1a knock-out mouse. Alteration of the Homer binding site to mGluR in mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice has no effect on the sleep phenotype, whereas crossing the mGluR(F-R) knock-in into the Homer null background resulted in increased duration of long wake bouts, suggesting a restored ability to maintain wakefulness, with other sleep/wake characteristics similar to littermate mice.ConclusionThese studies highlight the role of Pin1 binding to mGluR as a potential mechanism in the control of sleep/wake behavior. Future studies should explore whether other binding partners of Homer and mGluR also affect sleep and wake.",

Most of examples are directly inspired by <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">d3js examples on observablehq</a>.</p> <ul> <li>Comparison</li> </ul> <p>The API is almost the same:</p> <pre><code>// d3js const scale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 10]).range([0, 920]); console.log(scale.domain()) // [0, 10] # detroit scale = d3.scale_linear().set_domain([0, 10]).set_range([0, 920]) print(scale.get_domain()) # [0, 10] </code></pre> <p>The difference between <code>d3js</code>/<code>detroit</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>/<code>plotly</code>/<code>seaborn</code> is the approach to data visualization. With <code>matplotlib</code>, <code>plotly</code>, or <code>seaborn</code>, you only need to write a few lines and that's it - you get your visualization. However, if you want to customize some parts, you'll have to add a couple more lines, and it can become really hard to get exactly what you want. In contrast, with <code>d3js</code>/<code>detroit</code>, you know exactly what you are going to visualize, but it may require writing a few more lines of code.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bbourbonut\"> /u/bbourbonut </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ne4t1d/detroit_python_implementation_of_d3js/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ne4t1d/detroit_python_implementation_of_d3js/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08539v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper examines the generalization capacity of two state-of-the-art classification and similarity learning models in reliably identifying users based on their motions in various Extended Reality (XR) applications. We developed a novel dataset containing a wide range of motion data from 49 users in five different XR applications: four XR games with distinct tasks and action patterns, and an additional social XR application with no predefined task sets. The dataset is used to evaluate the performance and, in particular, the generalization capacity of the two models across applications. Our results indicate that while the models can accurately identify individuals within the same application, their ability to identify users across different XR applications remains limited. Overall, our results provide insight into current models generalization capabilities and suitability as biometric methods for user verification and identification. The results also serve as a much-needed risk assessment of hazardous and unwanted user identification in XR and Metaverse applications. Our cross-application XR motion dataset and code are made available to the public to encourage similar research on the generalization of motion-based user identification in typical Metaverse application use cases.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08514v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human-AI collaboration increasingly drives decision-making across industries, from medical diagnosis to content moderation. While AI systems promise efficiency gains by providing automated suggestions for human review, these workflows can trigger cognitive biases that degrade performance. We know little about the psychological factors that determine when these collaborations succeed or fail. We conducted a randomized experiment with 2,784 participants to examine how task design and individual characteristics shape human responses to AI-generated suggestions. Using a controlled annotation task, we manipulated three factors: AI suggestion quality in the first three instances, task burden through required corrections, and performance-based financial incentives. We collected demographics, attitudes toward AI, and behavioral data to assess four performance metrics: accuracy, correction activity, overcorrection, and undercorrection. Two patterns emerged that challenge conventional assumptions about human-AI collaboration. First, requiring corrections for flagged AI errors reduced engagement and increased the tendency to accept incorrect suggestions, demonstrating how cognitive shortcuts influence collaborative outcomes. Second, individual attitudes toward AI emerged as the strongest predictor of performance, surpassing demographic factors. Participants skeptical of AI detected errors more reliably and achieved higher accuracy, while those favorable toward automation exhibited dangerous overreliance on algorithmic suggestions. The findings reveal that successful human-AI collaboration depends not only on algorithmic performance but also on who reviews AI outputs and how review processes are structured. Effective human-AI collaborations require consideration of human psychology: selecting diverse evaluator samples, measuring attitudes, and designing workflows that counteract cognitive biases.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08459v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Consumer-level multi-material 3D printing with conductive thermoplastics enables fabrication of interactive elements for bespoke tangible devices. However, large feature sizes, high resistance materials, and limitations of printable control circuitry mean that deployable devices cannot be printed without post-print assembly steps. To address these challenges, we present Printegrated Circuits, a technique that uses traditional electronics as material to 3D print self-contained interactive objects. Embedded PCBs are placed into recesses during a pause in the print, and through a process we term \\textit{Prinjection}, conductive filament is injected into their plated-through holes. This automatically creates reliable electrical and mechanical contact, eliminating the need for manual wiring or bespoke connectors. We describe the custom machine code generation that supports our approach, and characterise its electrical and mechanical properties. With our 6 demonstrations, we highlight how the Printegrated Circuits process fits into existing design and prototyping workflows as well as informs future research agendas.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08444v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Expressive glyph visualizations provide a powerful and versatile means to represent complex multivariate data through compact visual encodings, but creating custom glyphs remains challenging due to the gap between design creativity and technical implementation. We present GlyphWeaver, a novel interactive system to enable an easy creation of expressive glyph visualizations. Our system comprises three key components: a glyph domain-specific language (GDSL), a GDSL operation management mechanism, and a multimodal interaction interface. The GDSL is a hierarchical container model, where each container is independent and composable, providing a rigorous yet practical foundation for complex glyph visualizations. The operation management mechanism restricts modifications of the GDSL to atomic operations, making it accessible without requiring direct coding. The multimodal interaction interface enables direct manipulation, natural language commands, and parameter adjustments. A multimodal large language model acts as a translator, converting these inputs into GDSL operations. GlyphWeaver significantly lowers the barrier for designers, who often do not have extensive programming skills, to create sophisticated glyph visualizations. A case study and user interviews with 13 participants confirm its substantial gains in design efficiency and effectiveness of producing creative glyph visualizations.",

Informed by expert interviews and literature review, HyperMOOC employs multi-glyph designs for different knowledge types and multi-stage interactions for deeper understanding. Using a timeline-based radial visualization, learners can grasp cognitive paths of concepts and navigate courses through hyperlink-based interactions. We evaluated HyperMOOC through a user study with 36 MOOC learners and interviews with two instructors.

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08357v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Eye tracking (ET) can help to understand visual attention and cognitive processes in interactive environments. This study presents a comprehensive eye-tracking analysis framework of the Inhibitory Control Game, named the ReStroop game, which is an educational intervention aimed at improving inhibitory control skills in children through a recycling-themed sorting task, for educational assessment that processes raw gaze data through unified algorithms for fixation detection, performance evaluation, and personalized intervention planning. The system employs dual-threshold eye movement detection (I-VT and advanced clustering), comprehensive Area of Interest (AOI) analysis, and evidence-based risk assessment to transform gaze patterns into actionable educational insights. We evaluated this framework across three difficulty levels and revealed critical attention deficits, including low task relevance, elevated attention scatter, and compromised processing efficiency. The multi-dimensional risk assessment identified high to moderate risk levels, triggering personalized interventions including focus training, attention regulation support, and environmental modifications. The system successfully distinguishes between adaptive learning and cognitive overload, providing early warning indicators for educational intervention. Results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in objective attention assessment, early risk identification, and the generation of evidence-based recommendations for students, teachers, and specialists, supporting data-driven educational decision-making and personalized learning approaches.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08353v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper introduces an innovative adaptive scoring framework for children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD) that is attributed to the integration of multiple metrics, such as spatial attention patterns, temporal engagement, and game performance data, to create a comprehensive assessment of learning that goes beyond traditional game scoring. The framework employs a progressive difficulty adaptation method, which focuses on specific stimuli for each level and adjusts weights dynamically to accommodate increasing cognitive load and learning complexity. Additionally, it includes capabilities for temporal analysis, such as detecting engagement periods, providing rewards for sustained attention, and implementing an adaptive multiplier framework based on performance levels. To avoid over-rewarding high performers while maximizing improvement potential for students who are struggling, the designed framework features an adaptive temporal impact framework that adjusts performance scales accordingly. We also established a multi-metric validation framework using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson correlation, and Spearman correlation, along with defined quality thresholds for assessing deployment readiness in educational settings. This research bridges the gap between technical eye-tracking metrics and educational insights by explicitly mapping attention patterns to learning behaviors, enabling actionable pedagogical interventions.",

We present componentization, an approach that decomposes model outputs into modular, independently editable units while preserving context. We describe Modular and Adaptable Output Decomposition (MAOD), which segments responses into coherent components and maintains links among them, and we outline the Component-Based Response Architecture (CBRA) as one way to implement this idea. Our reference prototype, MAODchat, uses a microservices design with state-machine-based decomposition agents, vendor-agnostic model adapters, and real-time component manipulation with recomposition.\n  In an exploratory study with four participants from academic, engineering, and product roles, we observed that component-level editing aligned with several common workflows and enabled iterative refinement and selective reuse. Participants also mentioned possible team workflows. Our contributions are: (1) a definition of componentization for transforming monolithic outputs into manipulable units, (2) CBRA and MAODchat as a prototype architecture, (3) preliminary observations from a small user study, (4) MAOD as an algorithmic sketch for semantic segmentation, and (5) example Agent-to-Agent protocols for automated decomposition. We view componentization as a promising direction for turning passive text consumption into more active, component-level collaboration.",

We conducted interviews with 20 video creators with visual and hearing impairments in Kenya to examine their tools, challenges, and collaborative practices. Our findings show that accessibility barriers and infrastructural limitations shape video creation as a staged, collaborative process involving trusted human partners and emerging AI tools. Across workflows, creators actively negotiated agency and trust, maintaining creative control while bridging sensory gaps. We discuss the need for flexible, interdependent collaboration models, inclusive human-AI workflows, and diverse storytelling practices. This work broadens accessibility research in HCI by examining how technology and social factors intersect in low-resource contexts, suggesting ways to better support disabled creators globally.",

    "content": "arXiv:2306.13802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In neuroimaging, extensive post-processing of resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data is necessary for its application and investigation in relation to brain-behavior associations. Such post-processing is used to derive brain representations, lower dimensional feature sets used for brain-behavior association studies. A brain representation involves a choice of dimension reduction (a parcellation into regions or networks) and a choice of feature type, such as spatial topography, connectivity matrix, amplitude. However, widespread variability in rfMRI brain representations has hindered both reproducibility and knowledge accumulation across the field. Brain representation choice effects measurements of inter-subject variability, which muddies the comparison and integration of findings. We leveraged persistent homology on the subject-space topologies induced by 34 different brain representations to enable direct comparison of brain representations in the context of individual differences. Our findings reveal the importance of considering feature type when comparing results derived from different brain representations, suggesting best practices for assessing the replicability and generalizability of brain-behavior research in rfMRI data.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.06810v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely assign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However, this flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here, we propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a capacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners create a \"compressed\" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal) which is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon receiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting learning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent with our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically impaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space structure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to correlate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal valuation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We leverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work suggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex goal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive mechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the neuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral techniques that support people in achieving their goals.",

However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the same eight NSD participants for 284 synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, we provide a proof of principle that OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with the original NSD data; we demonstrate that the degree of OOD (quantified as the distance between a set of responses and the training data used for modeling) is predictive of the magnitude of model failures; and we show that the concept of OOD is not restricted to artificial stimuli but can be usefully applied even within the domain of naturalistic stimuli. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.08779v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls), employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy. Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner 2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation. ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.",

However, CTh forecasting is a challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet), which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.",

We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic, label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing. Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing tailored to each model (per-window min--max for adversarial training; per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch band-power deltas ($\\Delta\\delta,\\ \\Delta\\theta,\\ \\Delta\\alpha,\\ \\Delta\\beta$), channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage.

In this study, we propose a novel co-simulation multiscale approach that unifies both micro- and macroscales to more rigorously capture brain dynamics. The presented design considers the electrodiffusive activity across the brain and in the network defined by the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus that is implicated in the mechanics of PD, as well as the contribution of presynaptic inputs in the highlighted regions. The application of DBS and its effects, along with the inclusion of stochastic noise are also examined. We found that the thalamus exhibits large, fluctuating spiking in both the deterministic and stochastic conditions, suggesting that noise contributes primarily to neural variability, rather than driving the overall spiking activity. Ultimately, this work intends to provide greater insights into the dynamics of PD and the brain which can eventually be converted into clinical use.",

Fundamentally, collectives have greater computational resources with more sensory information, more memory, more processing capacity, and more ways to act. While greater resources present opportunities, there are also challenges in coordination and cooperation inherent in collectives with distributed, modular structures. Despite these challenges, we show how collective resource advantages lead directly to well-known forms of collective intelligence including the wisdom of the crowd, collective sensing, division of labour, and cultural learning. Our framework also generates testable predictions about collective capabilities in distributed reasoning and context-dependent behavioural switching. Through case studies of animal navigation and decision-making, we demonstrate how collectives leverage their computational resources to solve problems not only more effectively than individuals, but by using qualitatively different problem-solving strategies.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.07991v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep learning models have been frequently used to decode a single brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG). It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\\%, 59.88\\%, and 59.56\\%, respectively. We made an initial attempt to develop a general model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification, avoiding retraining or redevelopment for each paradigm. This study paves the way for the development of an effective but simple model for cross-BCI-paradigm decoding, which might benefit the design of portable devices for universal BCI decoding.",

    "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
    "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",

Furthermore, adherence to the Mediterranean diet - and the associated lutein and zeaxanthin intake - showed no significant association with MPOD values or visual performance in this pediatric sample. These findings suggest that children's dietary habits may not influence MPOD values or visual function. Further studies with more diverse and...",

    "title": "Object-scene semantics correlation analysis for image emotion classification",
    "content": "IntroductionImage emotion classification (IEC), which predicts human emotional perception from images, is a research highlight for its wide applications. Recently, most existing methods have focused on predicting emotions by mining semantic information. However, the \u201caffective gap\u201d between low-level pixels and high-level emotions constrains semantic representation and degrades model performance. It has been demonstrated in psychology that emotions can be triggered by the interaction between meaningful objects and their rich surroundings within an image. Inspired by this, we propose an Object-Scene Attention Fusion Network (OSAFN) that leverages object-level concepts and scene-level reasoning as auxiliary information for enhanced emotional classification.MethodsThe proposed OSAFN designs two different strategies to extract semantic information. Specifically, concepts are selected by utilizing an external concept extraction tool, and an Appraisal-based Chain-of-Thought (Appraisal-CoT) prompting is introduced to guide large language models in generating scene information. Next, two different attention-based modules are developed for aligning semantic features with visual features to enhance visual representations. Then, an adaptive fusion strategy is introduced for integrating the results of both the object-semantic stream and the scene-semantic stream. Additionally, a polarity-aware contrastive loss is proposed to model the hierarchical structure of emotions, improving the discrimination of fine-grained emotional categories.Results and discussionTo evaluate the effectiveness of OSAFN, we conducted numerical experiments on four affective datasets. The results demonstrate that OSAFN achieves superior performance and represents a notable contribution in the field of IEC.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life.

    "title": "Examining the associations between nonbelieved memories and memory distrust, self-esteem, and rumination.",
    "content": "When beliefs in autobiographical memories are reduced while recollections remain relatively intact, a phenomenon termed nonbelieved memories (NBMs) unfolds. The current preregistered study (<em>N</em> = 104) used a 3-week longitudinal design to investigate the relationships between the frequency of recalled NBMs, memory distrust, rumination over autobiographical events, and self-esteem. Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Dissociation is a phenomenon present in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders as well as in the general population. The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "title": "Mental pain, boredom, and diffuse nociception.",
    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: There is a need for effective cognitive assessment tools to evaluate the development of very young children in resource-limited low- and middle-income country settings. Our objective was to evaluate the field usability of a computer-based attention test and its concurrent validity with a caregiver-reported screener of neurodevelopment in rural, Ecuadorian children. Method: To assess a computer-based attention test in a resource-limited setting, 41 Ecuadorian children between 2 and 4 years of age were evaluated once with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention adapted to eye-tracking instrumentation. To evaluate the validity of the ECVT, results were compared with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133, measured 3\u20134 times between 21 and 48 months of age. Results: ECVT measures were collected successfully for 97.6% of children (40/41), suggesting good field usability of the test in this resource-limited setting. An increase in 1 SD in child attention, as measured by the ECVT average fixation duration, was associated with a 7.9-point increase in the overall Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133 score (95% CI [1.5, 14.2], <em>p</em> = .015). Conclusions: A computer-based attention assessment in early childhood was usable in a resource-limited setting and predictive of a caregiver-reported screener of child neurodevelopment. The ECVT, therefore, can be used to assess the effects of early risk factors and resilience in brain/behavior development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Slower and more variable reaction time is one of the most prominent cognitive signatures in childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index \u201cspeed\u201d potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. Method: The present study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children aged 8\u201312 with and without ADHD (<em>N</em> = 119). Results: There was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the <em>tau</em> parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD and among children with low working memory capacity (regardless of ADHD status). Variance in <em>tau</em> was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of adopting analytic methods that can more accurately describe performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Self-appraisal of cognitive performance, a potentially useful marker of brain functioning, is typically assessed at a single time point where tests are na\u00efve to what constitutes \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d performance. Here, we determine whether familiarizing individuals with self-appraisal with daily memory testing for 7 days provide a more accurate estimate of cognitive functioning and mood. Method: Two hundred twenty-five participants (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> \u00b1 <em>SD</em>: 74.1 \u00b1 8.3 years; 66% female; median education 16.0 years) completed the online Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health, which included two associative memory tasks, for seven consecutive days. Each day, participants self-appraised their performance. At baseline, they completed various cognitive and mood measures. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between task performance and self-appraisal on Days 1 and 7 and used linear models to examine the relationship between self-appraisal scores and clinical measures. Results: Accuracy (Day 1: 0.44 \u00b1 0.12; Day 7: 0.81 \u00b1 0.16) and self-appraisal (Day 1: 0.36 \u00b1 0.15; Day 7: 0.70 \u00b1 0.21) increased, as did the association between accuracy and self-appraisal, Day 1: correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [0.09, 0.34], <em>p</em> = .001; Day 7: <em>r</em> = 0.69, 95% CI [0.62, 0.76], <em>p</em> < .001. Self-appraisal scores on Day 7, but not Day 1, showed significant relationships with in-clinic measures. Conclusions: Repeated remote cognitive assessments may help elucidate individuals\u2019 capacities to refine their self-perception of cognitive performance during multiday learning. The weak association between accuracy and test-na\u00efve self-appraisal warrants caution about using this metric cross-sectionally. Experienced self-appraisal could be especially relevant at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when subtle learning difficulties emerge and could improve our capacity to detect early meta-cognitive changes.

    "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance.

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "Phonological alternations are common in speech, but the neurocognitive mechanisms for their encoding during word production remain unclear. Mandarin Tone 3 sandhi is an example of phonological alternation, whereby the Tone 3 (T3), a low-dipping tone, changes to a Tone 2 (T2)-like rising tone when followed by another T3. Previous research indicates that both the underlying tonal category and the surface tonal variant are activated during T3 sandhi word production, but the neural substrates of...",

    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychological norms serve to identify cognitive impairment and monitor neurodegenerative disease progression. However, longitudinal data are limited, and conventional approaches do not account for biomarkers to exclude underlying Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, reducing sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive decline in preclinical AD. To address these limitations, this research provides robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms derived from Spanish individuals with nonpathological levels of AD biomarkers. Method: We analyzed 3-year follow-up data from 350 cognitively unimpaired individuals (Alzheimer\u2019s and Families+ cohort). A subset of 228 individuals with normal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242/40, phosphorylated-tau181, and total-tau biomarkers defined the robust reference group. Neuropsychological assessment encompassed the Trail Making Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Memory Binding Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013IV, Wechsler Memory Scale\u2013IV, Semantic Fluency Test, and Judgment of Line Orientation from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Using the Reliable Change Index and Standardized Regression-Based methods, robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms were derived from the reference group. Validation analysis assessed the sensitivity of robust versus conventional normative procedures. Results: Models, equations, percentiles, and cutoffs for identifying significant cognitive decline were provided. Robust norms showed modestly greater sensitivity in certain measures, particularly in episodic memory. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: Total Free Delayed Recall showed the most notable result at the 5th percentile in Reliable Change Index (\u03c7\u00b2 = 16.06, <em>p</em> = 6.15E-05). Conclusions: Robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms may improve the detection of subtle cognitive decline, modestly enhancing sensitivity at the lower ends of distributions.

    "title": "Posttraumatic stress symptomatology rather than mild traumatic brain injury is related to atypical early neural processing during cognitive control.",
    "content": "Objective: Many veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) report disruptions in cognition; however, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these cognitive difficulties are not well understood. It is also unknown whether PTSD symptomatology or past mTBIs uniquely impact functions important to adaptation such as cognitive control. Method: We examined event-related potentials elicited by a flanker task to evaluate brain responses during conflict monitoring in a sample of 192 U.S. military veterans with combat-zone experience and exposure to explosive blasts. Clinical assessments characterized diagnoses as well as the severity of PTSD symptoms and mTBI so that we could parse overlapping syndromes and directly contrast effects of the two conditions. Results: Across groups, participants performed worse on conflict trials (Incongruent distractors), particularly when preceded by a no-conflict (Congruent distractors) trial. We found that greater dysphoric PTSD symptomatology was related to a reduced early perceptual response (P1), while greater avoidance PTSD symptomatology predicted a larger early visual attention response (N1). Although late cognitive processes (N2, P3) were sensitive to cognitive control demands of the flanker task, posttraumatic symptomatology and mTBI severity were unrelated to them. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the Avoidance and Dysphoria domains of PTSD symptomatology may differentially relate to early neural functions of perception and visual attention rather than later cognitive responses. Rehabilitation and treatment of individuals with PTSD and mTBI may be most productive when focused on perceptual and attentional processing, which could improve cognitive control.

    "title": "Acquired crowding dyslexia: A peripheral reading deficit other than neglect dyslexia.",
    "content": "Objectives: Crowding refers to the phenomenon whereby small visual objects above the acuity threshold are detected but unrecognizable when surrounded by nearby stimuli. It affects reading in healthy individuals and can be enhanced in reading impairments. By increasing the interletter space, crowding decreases. Previous evidence on patients with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and peripheral dyslexia has shown a dissociation in sensitivity to spacing manipulation between those who mainly produced omissions and those characterized by substitutions in reading. Here, we wanted to verify the hypothesis that the reading impairment mainly characterized by substitutions is dissociated from USN, unlike the one characterized by omissions. Method: In a retrospective study, we collected 38 right-brain-damaged patients, 21 with USN. We analyzed the number and types of errors in reading single words and pseudowords, spaced and unspaced, comparing patients with and without USN. Results: USN patients showed significantly more omissions than patients without USN and increased omissions with letter spacing. Substitutions were more frequent in USN patients but did not increase with spacing. Performance of patients mainly characterized by substitutions revealed a reduction of errors with spaced pseudowords and a double dissociation from USN. Lesion overlap analysis suggested that the two deficits could depend on different components of visuospatial attention networks. Conclusions: We claim that proper neglect dyslexia is characterized by omission errors and has USN as a necessary mechanism, even if not sufficient. Conversely, acquired crowding dyslexia is a different reading deficit, characterized by substitutions due to an enhanced crowding phenomenon, independent of USN.

    "content": "Objective: Cannabis has become increasingly accessible to populations living with chronic health conditions such as HIV. Many people living with HIV are turning to cannabis for symptom relief despite the unclear risks to neurocognitive health. Our study sought to replicate and extend prior research by examining global and domain-specific neurocognitive performance between four groups stratified by use of cannabis (CB; CB+/CB\u2212) and HIV serostatus (HIV+/HIV\u2212). Method: Our demographically diverse community sample (<em>N</em> = 269) underwent exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the effects of cannabis use (CU) and HIV on neurocognition. We explored between-group comparisons of neurocognitive performance, probability of neurocognitive impairment, and interactive effects of CU/HIV serostatus. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed nonsignificant differences in global or domain-specific neurocognitive performance. However, the CB+/HIV+ group was three times (99% CI [1.18, 9.57]) more likely to be labeled with a memory impairment compared to the control (CB-/HIV\u2212), and the CB+/HIV\u2212 group was twice (99% CI [.14, 7.47]) as likely to be labeled with an executive functioning impairment compared to the control. We also identified an interactive effect between the past 30-day CU and HIV serostatus for global (<em>b</em> = \u2212.026, 99% CI [\u2212.04, \u2212.01]) and motor (<em>b</em> = \u2212.052, 99% CI [\u2212.07, \u2212.03]) neurocognitive performance. Findings support a nuanced relationship between CU and HIV, which may partly explain mixed literature. Conclusions: Although we conclude that recent and heavy CU poses risk of neurocognitive decline among people living with HIVs, this effect is modest. Physicians and patients must weigh a possible decrease in global and motor neurocognition against the severity of symptoms being treated.

Here, we explored if there was any relationship between waking-life experiences related to elder relatives with both dreaming about elder relatives and dreaming about animals. For 1 day, 270 participants recorded waking-life experiences in daily diaries before sleeping and recorded their dreams upon waking. Two external judges rated if there was any content related to elder relatives or animals in both daily diaries and dreams. The most three frequent animals in dreams were dogs, cats, and snakes, or fishes, or birds. The frequency of waking-life experiences related to elder relatives was correlated with both the frequency of dreaming about elder relatives and the frequency of dreaming about animals. Yet, the latter two variables were not correlated with each other. The results supported the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. In addition, the results may suggest that some animals in dreams represented elder relatives in waking life metaphorically. Moreover, the results may support Carl Jung\u2019s idea that the image of animals in dreams may be a symbol of parents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

A questionnaire was administered to 384 participants (mean age = 20.63 years, SD = 1.21; 205 females, 179 males), revealing that over half of them reported having sexual dreams, with a higher prevalence among males. The sexual dream group scored higher than the nonsexual dream group on aggressiveness, neuroticism, and sensation seeking. Furthermore, negative emotions, sensation seeking, activity, and extraversion play an important role in the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences among sexual dreamers.

The present, brief report is a post hoc analysis of previously unanalyzed items from two studies of bereaved individuals. One study focused on loss following the death of a romantic partner (n = 268) and the other following the death of a dog or cat (n = 199). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had dreamed of the deceased or had a waking experience of seeing, hearing, or feeling the touch of the deceased in the prior month. Consistent with prior research, a substantial portion of each sample (50.7% of the partner loss participants and 32.2% of the pet loss) reported at least one waking experience of seeing, hearing, and/or feeling the deceased. When dreaming of the deceased and/or having a waking experience of the deceased were combined, it was found to be 82.5% for partner loss and 68.2% for pet loss. Furthermore, dreaming about the deceased was related to having such waking experiences. These preliminary, exploratory findings contribute to the growing recognition that we need more research and theory into the function of such experiences for the bereaved and for those facing end of life.

The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "Transformer-based multimodal precision intervention model for enhancing diaphragm function in elderly patients",
    "content": "Diaphragm dysfunction represents a significant complication in elderly patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, often resulting in extended intensive care stays, unsuccessful weaning attempts, and increased healthcare expenditures. To address the deficiency of precise, real-time decision support in this context, a novel artificial intelligence framework is proposed, integrating imaging, physiological signals, and ventilator parameters. Initially, a hierarchical Transformer encoder is employed to extract modality-specific embeddings, followed by an attention-guided cross-modal fusion module and a temporal network for dynamic trend prediction. The framework was assessed using three public datasets, which are, the MIMIC-IV, eICU, and Chest X-ray. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy (92.3% on MIMIC-IV, 91.8% on eICU, 92.0% on Chest X-ray) and surpassed all baselines in precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, the model's probability estimates were well-calibrated, and its SHAP-based explainability analysis identified ventilator volume and key imaging features as primary predictors. The clinical implications of this study are significant. By providing precise and interpretable predictions, the proposed model has the potential to transform critical care practices by offering a pathway to more effective and personalized interventions for high-risk patients.",

    "content": "As global life expectancy rises, a growing proportion of the population is affected by dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Electroencephalography (EEG) based diagnosis presents a non-invasive, cost effective alternative for early detection, yet existing methods are challenged by data scarcity, inter-subject variability, and privacy concerns. This study proposes lightweight and privacy-preserving EEG classification framework combining deep learning and Federated Learning (FL). Five convolutional neural networks (EEGNetv1, EEGNetv4, EEGITNet, EEGInception, EEGInceptionERP) have been evaluated on resting-state EEG dataset comprising 88 subjects. EEG signals are preprocessed using band-pass (1\u201345 Hz) and notch filtering, followed by exponential standardization and 4-second windowing. EEGNetv4 outperformed among other EEG tailored models, and upon utilizing the hybrid fusion techniques it achieves 97.1% accuracy using only 1,609 parameters and less than 1 MB of memory, demonstrating high efficiency. Moreover, FL using FedAvg is implemented across five stratified clients, achieving 96.9% accuracy on the hybrid fused EEGNetV4 model while preserving data privacy. This work establishes a scalable, resource-efficient, and privacy-compliant framework for EEG-based dementia diagnosis, suitable for deployment in real-world clinical and edge-device settings.",

    "title": "Maximizing theoretical and practical storage capacity in single-layer feedforward neural networks",
    "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

    "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

These findings suggest that children's dietary habits may not influence MPOD values or visual function. Further studies with more diverse and...",

This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Anti-ELAB) was a 7-month large-scale and highly traumatic social movement in Hong Kong that began in March 2019 in opposition to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government to amend its extradition laws. Using a sample of 112 Chinese young adult (74 females, 38 males, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.83) residents in Hong Kong, this article reports an investigation into relationships between trauma (as manifested in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), dream content (dream motifs, classified according to persecution or ego ideal delusional inclinations), and nightmare distress, all recalled by participants in relation to personal experiences of the Anti-ELAB. The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay.

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "Loss of presenilin 2 function age-dependently increases susceptibility to kainate-induced acute seizures and blunts hippocampal kainate-type glutamate receptor expression",
    "content": "Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene variants increase the risk of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD patients with PSEN2 variants have increased risk of unprovoked seizures versus age-matched healthy controls, yet few studies have interrogated PSEN2 contributions to seizures, and fewer have done so with aging. PSEN2 variant mice also do not exhibit amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation, allowing for the assessment of A{beta}-independent contributions to seizure risk in AD. Critically, PSEN proteolytic capacity may regulate hippocampal kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs), with PSEN deletion reducing KAR availability and synaptic transmission in vitro (Barthet et al 2022). Kainic acid (KA) is a naturally occurring KAR agonist that acutely evokes severe seizures in mice. We thus hypothesized that PSEN2 knockout (KO) mice would have reduced latency to acutely evoked seizures and status epilepticus (SE), increased convulsive SE burden, worsened 7-day survival, and altered hippocampal KAR expression vs age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Using a repeated low-dose systemic KA administration paradigm, we quantified the latency to acute seizures and convulsive SE, then quantified neuropathology in 3-4-month-old and 12-15-month-old male and female PSEN2 KO versus WT mice. GluK2 and GluK5 KAR subunit expression was colocalized in astrocytes and neurons by immunohistochemistry 7 days after KA-SE or sham-SE to define the interaction between PSEN2 loss and acute seizures on hippocampal KARs. Regardless of sex, young PSEN2 KO mice were more susceptible to KA-induced acute seizures than WTs. Young PSEN2 KO mice of both sexes also entered SE sooner than age-matched WT mice. In aged mice, there was no significant difference in latency to first seizure or SE onset between genotypes in either sex. However, regardless of genotype, aged females entered SE sooner than young females and experienced greater mortality. This was not observed in males. Among young animals, there was no difference in KAR expression between genotypes and regardless of treatment group. In both genotypes, hippocampal CA3 astrocytes expressed GluK5 following KA-SE, however, astrocytic GluK2 expression only occurred in WT mice. GluK5 expression was significantly reduced in untreated aged PSEN2 KO mice versus untreated WT mice, while total GluK2 expression did not differ between genotypes or seizure groups. Following KA-SE, astrocytic GluK5 expression was only present in WT animals in CA3, while both genotypes presented with astrocytic GluK5 expression. This study highlights that KARs are an understudied contributor to seizures in aging and AD that warrant further investigation.",

    "title": "Spectral envelopes of rhythmic facial movements predict intention and motor cortical representations",
    "content": "Animals, including humans, use coordinated facial movements to sample the environment, ingest nutrients, and communicate. To study these behaviors and the neural signals that underlie them, we introduce face-rhythm, a tool for quantitatively tracking, extracting, and interpreting facial movements. The approach utilizes markerless point tracking, spectral analysis, and tensor component analysis to extract demixed components of behavior from videos of facial movements. Face-rhythm is fully unsupervised and allows for the discovery of uninstructed behaviors; when applied to videos of facial behavior, face-rhythm identifies interpretable behaviors such as whisking, sniffing, and snout movements. Analysis of videos of mice in various behavioral conditions, including a classical conditioning protocol, a brain-machine interface (BMI) task, and natural behaviors outside of a task structure, revealed robust signatures of uninstructed facial movements in all regimes. The expression of these facial movements predicted internal belief states during classical conditioning and was correlated with instructed neural activity when the BMI was activated. Furthermore, facial behaviors identified by face-rhythm were highly represented in face-associated areas of primary motor cortex (M1). We found that M1 neural activity encodes a mixed representation of both the phase of facial movements as well as the phase-invariant spectral envelope of movement patterns, with higher-frequency facial movements being more likely to be represented as phase-invariant. Our results demonstrate that face-rhythm provides a novel and flexible approach for decomposing continuous face movements into natural behavioral motifs that are closely linked to neural activity patterns.",

    "title": "CA2 neurons show abnormal responses to social stimuli in a rat model of Fragile X syndrome",
    "content": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly comorbid with autism spectrum disorders and can cause abnormal social behaviors. The CA2 subregion of the hippocampus is essential for social memory processing and social recognition. A social interaction induces changes in CA2 neuronal firing; however, it is unknown whether these changes are impaired in FXS models. Here, we examined CA2 activity in a rat model of Fragile X Syndrome (Fmr1 knockout rats). In Fmr1 knockout rats, we observed impaired CA2 cell responses to social stimuli, despite similar social behaviors. Further, in CA2 of Fmr1 knockout rats, we found reduced expression of oxytocin receptors and impaired whole cell responses to oxytocin.

    "title": "Fractionation of sex differences in human cortical anatomy",
    "content": "Humans show reproducible sex differences in regional cortical volume (CV), but it remains unclear how these arise from underlying sex-biases in the two biologically dissociable determinants of CV: surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT). Moreover, limited access to experimental methods in humans has hindered direct studies of the causal drivers of regional sex differences in the human cortex, although rodent models have argued for both chromosomal and gonadal contributions to sex-biased mammalian cortical development. Here, we first use structural neuroimaging data in two independent human cohorts (combined N=1,754; 967 females) to quantify and spatially resolve the differential contributions of SA and CT to observed sex differences in CV. These dissociable facets of sex-biased cortical organization are highly reproducible and align with distinct functional networks and histo-molecular signatures. We then leverage complementary neuroimaging data in clinical case-control cohorts (combined N=313) featuring variations in X and Y chromosome dosage (sex chromosome aneuploidies) and testicular hormone production (isolated GnRH deficiency) to establish that regions of sex-biased CV, SA and CT in humans are enriched for congruent anatomical effects of X-chromosome dosage (e.g., primary sensory and insular cortices) and gonadal hormones (e.g. dorsomedial frontal and temporo-parietal-occipital regions). Taken together, these findings substantially advance both the breadth and granularity of our understanding regarding sex-biased cortical organization in humans - disambiguating sex effects on regional CV, SA and CT and nominating their potential genetic and endocrine causes.",

    "title": "Spatiomolecular mapping reveals anatomical organization of heterogeneous cell types in the human nucleus accumbens",
    "content": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key component of the mesolimbic dopamine system that critically regulates many behaviors related to reward and motivation. The NAc is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. Rodent studies have identified spatial organization of heterogeneous medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes across the NAc core and shell, but the extent to which this cellular diversity and spatial organization is conserved in the human brain remains unclear. Here, we generated a spatiomolecular atlas of NAc cell types and spatial domains by integrating spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem NAc tissue from 10 neurotypical adult donors. We identified 20 transcriptionally unique cell populations and 8 spatial domains, including specialized D1 islands composed of distinct dopamine receptor 1 (DRD1) MSN subtypes, which were enriched for OPRM1. In contrast to a discrete core vs. shell division, we observed continuous spatial gradients of gene expression across MSN domains, suggesting a more complex organization of DRD1 and DRD2 MSNs. Cross-species comparisons demonstrated conservation of MSN subtypes and spatial features between human, rodent, and nonhuman primate NAc. Genetic enrichment analysis with stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression revealed specific spatial domains associated with risk for psychiatric and addiction-related traits. To investigate this further, we spatially mapped ligand-receptor interactions involving neuropsychiatric risk genes. Finally, we leveraged existing rodent NAc data to identify drug-responsive transcriptional programs and predict their spatial distribution in the human NAc. Collectively, we provide a spatiomolecular framework for understanding the human NAc and its relevance to neuropsychiatric disease.",

    "title": "Interneuron theta phase locking controls seizure susceptibility",
    "content": "The timing of neuronal activity is highly precise and often organized by brain-wide oscillations. Many neurons modulate their firing rates at specific phases of theta (known as theta phase locking), creating discrete windows for information processing. Disrupted theta phase locking has been found across several neurological and psychiatric disorders (e.g., epilepsy), but gaps in technology have prevented its causal influence from being tested. Here, we developed PhaSER, a closed-loop optogenetic system designed to control the phase locking of specific interneurons, and demonstrate a causal role for inhibitory phase locking in seizure susceptibility. We first found that parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SOM+) expressing interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) show distinct theta phase locking profiles and are differentially impacted in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. In healthy mice, PV+ interneurons have extremely consistent phase-locked firing near the trough of CA1 theta, aligned with excitatory inputs to DG. However, in epileptic mice, PV+ interneuron activity is dispersed across the theta cycle, suggesting that altered inhibitory phase locking could be a causal mediator of seizure susceptibility in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we applied PhaSER to directly control the phase locking of DG interneurons during an acute test of seizure susceptibility. In epileptic mice, re-aligning DG PV+ interneuron theta phase locking reduced seizure susceptibility, while in healthy mice, disrupting normal phase locking of PV+ interneurons increased seizure susceptibility. Together, this provides the first causal evidence that inhibitory theta phase locking can directly control network function by shifting seizure susceptibility in the healthy and epileptic brain.",

    "title": "Pth4 neurons define a novel hypothalamic circuit that promotes sleep via brainstem monoaminergic neurons",
    "content": "Classical studies identified a critical role for the hypothalamus in regulating sleep and wake states, but few such hypothalamic neuronal populations have been identified. Here we describe a sleep-promoting population of hypothalamic neurons that expresses the neuropeptides QRFP and parathyroid hormone 4 (Pth4) in zebrafish. Optogenetic stimulation of these neurons results in a large increase in sleep that requires pth4 but not qrfp. Noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons and serotonergic raphe neurons (RN) in the hindbrain express distinct pth receptors, and genetic epistasis and cell ablation experiments revealed that Pth4 neuron-induced sleep is suppressed in mutants that lack noradrenaline in the LC or lack the serotonergic RN. Pth4 neuron-induced sleep is also suppressed in serine/threonine kinase 32a (stk32a) mutants, possibly via stk32a-expressing neurons in the prethalamus that express pth receptors. These results identify QRFP/Pth4 neurons as a novel hypothalamic sleep-promoting population and support a model in which distinct sleep- and wake-promoting hypothalamic populations act via monoaminergic neurons in the hindbrain to control vigilance state.",

    "content": "Dendrites in diverse neuronal cell types, including interneurons, are active structures that enhance neuronal computational capabilities. Neurogliaform interneurons exhibit robust synaptic plasticity and supralinear summation of clustered dendritic inputs. However, the principles governing supralinear synaptic integration, its interaction with backpropagating somatic signals, and the interplay of the two in the context of synaptic plasticity, remain incompletely understood. We developed a biophysically realistic, multi-compartmental model of a murine hippocampal neurogliaform interneuron, recapitulating key experimental results on dendritic integration. We simulated diverse synaptic input configurations and action potential backpropagation, generating testable predictions validated through ex vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology and two-photon imaging. We further examined how dendritic supralinear integration interacts with backpropagating action potentials to influence synaptic plasticity. Our results show that while both clustered and dispersed synaptic inputs elicit supralinear responses in neurogliaform interneurons, clustered inputs induce more pronounced local depolarisations and calcium transients. Somatic action potentials backpropagate across the dendritic arbour but are attenuated at branch points. Coincident synaptic input and backpropagating action potentials enhance EPSP amplitude and increase calcium influx along the dendrite, enabling voltage and calcium signal propagation and thereby likely contributing to synaptic plasticity.",

    "content": "Extended cessation (EC), an advanced meditative state in which consciousness is volitionally suspended and later reset with immense mental clarity, equanimity, and peace, offers an endogenous model for investigating the mechanisms of consciousness. Using ultra-high-resolution 7T fMRI with dense within-subject sampling (N=3), we quantified whole-brain activity, functional and effective connectivity, cortical gradients, and eigenmodes, and related them to chemoarchitecture and cognitive maps. EC is marked by increased activity in unimodal regions, down-regulation in transmodal regions, subcortex, and brainstem, an expansion of the principal gradient, and decrease in low-order global eigenmodes. Cognitive decoding linked EC to heightened perceptual clarity and attention, least with mental suffering, and co-varied with histaminergic H receptors topology. These findings challenge predictions of Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory, while supporting the Active Inference Framework. More broadly, EC demonstrates that consciousness can cease without global suppression, suggesting a potential 'reset' mechanism that fosters equanimity and the potential for flourishing.

    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Predicting attachment style from EEG data on the Flanker task",
    "content": "Bowlby's attachment theory describes the differences that people exhibit in the way they form emotional bonds with others. The dimensional measure of attachment describes it by the magnitude of anxiety and an avoidance dimension, which are currently measured using a self-report questionnaire. Recent advances in neurophysiological methods have started exploring the neural underpinnings of attachment styles. Nonetheless, a conspicuous gap remains: the underexplored realm of predictive models for predicting attachment styles based on objective physiological data. With that in mind, we have constructed a model for inferring individual attachment profiles, based solely on their brain signals recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG). For that aim, we recorded EEG data of 27 participants engaged in the Flanker task and receiving either positive or negative feedback following each trial. We then utilized the recently developed ROCKET algorithm (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) to automatically extract 20,000 time-series features from the EEG data. Next, we applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reduced the number of features to 87 individual components that were used to construct regression models predicting participants' anxiety and avoidance scores, as measured by the ECR-R questionnaire. Our results show, for the first time, that individual attachment profiles can be inferred from EEG data, allowing post hoc categorization into the four canonical attachment styles. This offers two key contributions: first, it provides an objective alternative to traditional self-report questionnaires, helping reduce subjectivity bias in attachment assessment. Second, it highlights the value of using automatically generated features over the limited set of hand-crafted features typically found in the literature.",

The patients of the experimental group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 45 min, and the patients of the control group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 30 min. The follow-up parameters were: age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and discharge, early rehabilitation interruptions, presence of tracheostomy, decubitus ulcers, nasogastric tube, diapers and urinary catheter at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and discharge from the hospital, and mortality.Results124 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 62 patients each. The male gender dominated 95 (76.6%). The average age was Me = 62.00 (IQR = 36.0) years.

    "content": "BackgroundAcupuncture has been practiced in China for centuries, and LR3 (Taichong) is a key acupoint of the liver meridian that has been widely studied. Whether its central mechanism differs by sex remains unclear, because earlier work used single-sex or mixed-sex samples without stratified analysis. To close this gap, we used task-based fMRI together with the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale to compare sex differences in brain activation and thalamic functional connectivity.MethodsWe enrolled 30 men and 25 women in a block-design acupuncture task, the modular task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique was employed to investigate brain activity, and the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was utilized to assess acupuncture sensations experienced by the participants. Alterations in activated brain regions and functional connectivity were examined separately for males and females. Statistical analyses were performed to determine potential gender differences in acupuncture sensation.ResultsSignificant statistical differences were observed in the 12 acupuncture sensation scores of the MASS scale (p < 0.001). Acupuncture LR3 activated the left inferior cerebellar gyrus, right superior margin gyrus, and left posterior central gyrus in women, and activated the right superior margin gyrus, left central sulcus, and right paracentral lobule in men. Enhanced functional connectivity was also observed in the bilateral thalamus of women: the bilateral caudate nucleus, right precuneus, right cuneate fissure, and bilateral lingular gyrus were highly active. Furthermore, the right thalami also demonstrated enhanced functional connectivity with the left cuneate fissure, right posterior cingulate gyrua, and left precuneu.ConclusionThe differences in the functional connectivity of the right superior marginal gyrus and thalamus between men and women may account for the differences in acupuncture sensory processing between men and women. In addition, the right superior marginal gyrus may be a specific brain region critical for activation of the LR3 acupoint.",

    "title": "Social and non-social directional cues differentially orient attention by learned habit",
    "content": "IntroductionSince an early age, we are implicitly motivated to use the direction of eye gaze of others to learn about the environment, and we orient our attention in space based on this directional signal. Similarly, we orient our attention based on the direction of arrow signs. In both cases, the mechanisms underlying attentional orienting rely on the activity of brain areas involved in endogenous attention; however, orienting by gaze direction also relies on brain areas involved in exogenous attention.Research questionsTo date, it remains unclear whether the acquisition of attentional habit, which can also guide attention in ways that are not purely endogenous or exogenous, is similar for gaze and arrow or rather differs in some important way. We aimed to assess whether learning implicit regularities implemented with exogenous, arrow, and gaze stimuli guides attention in space.MethodsUsing the Posner paradigm, we conducted a series of behavioral experiments with exogenous, arrow, and gaze cues. Unbeknownst to participants, specific regularities, namely cue predictive validity and probability cueing, were implemented through blocks (baseline, learning, testing).Results and discussionThe findings showed that predictive validity alone is not sufficient to engender habitual attention for all types of cues. However, it becomes effective when combined with probability cueing. Importantly, a learned habit with gaze cues engenders unique effects on attention compared to other cues.ConclusionSocially relevant directional signals, such as gaze, can bias spatial attention more effectively than perceptual or non-social directional stimuli.",

    "content": "IntroductionDyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by unilateral hemiparesis, facial asymmetry, severe epilepsy, and intellectual disability. While congenital DDMS is predominantly attributed to anterior circulation anomalies [e.g., internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) hypoplasia], posterior circulation involvement remains unreported. Here, we present the first documented case of congenital DDMS resulting from a rare combination of hypoplastic left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and ipsilateral fetal-type posterior communicating artery (FTP).Case presentationA 19-year-old male exhibited atypical DDMS manifestations: absence seizures, preserved motor function, and occipitotemporal cognitive deficits (MoCA: 20/30). Neuroimaging revealed classic DDMS features. Angiography confirmed left PCA hypoplasia with FTP persistence, while CT perfusion demonstrated chronic left PCA hypoperfusion. Lamotrigine (100\u202fmg/day) and regular cognition rehabilitative training resulted in good symptom control.ConclusionThis case identifies PCA hypoplasia with FTP as a novel DDMS etiology, challenging the MCA/ICA-centric paradigm. The \u201cposterior phenotype\u201d (absence seizures, preserved motor function, occipitotemporal cognitive deficits) expands DDMS heterogeneity. Multimodal imaging (angiography/perfusion) is diagnostic gold-standard, while personalized therapy optimizes outcomes.",

    "content": "Myoelectric control systems translate electromyographic signals (EMG) from muscles into movement intentions, allowing control over various interfaces, such as prosthetics, wearable devices, and robotics. However, a major challenge lies in enhancing the system's ability to generalize, personalize, and adapt to the high variability of EMG signals. Artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks, has shown promising decoding performance when applied to large datasets. However, highly parameterized deep neural networks usually require extensive user-specific data with ground truth labels to learn individual unique EMG patterns. However, the characteristics of the EMG signal can change significantly over time, even for the same user, leading to performance degradation during extended use. In this work, we propose an innovative three-stage neural network training scheme designed to progressively develop an adaptive workflow, improving and maintaining the network performance on 28 subjects over 2 days.

    "title": "Integrated neural network framework for multi-object detection and recognition using UAV imagery",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate vehicle analysis from aerial imagery has become increasingly vital for emerging technologies and public service applications such as intelligent traffic management, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and military surveillance. However, analyzing UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep learning\u2013driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV platforms.MethodThe framework suggests using today\u2019s best neural networks that are made to solve different problems in aerial vehicle analysis. RetinexNet is used in preprocessing to make the lighting of each input frame consistent. Using HRNet for semantic segmentation allows for accurate splitting between vehicles and their surroundings. YOLOv11 provides high precision and quick vehicle detection and Deep SORT allows reliable tracking without losing track of individual cars. CSRNet are used for vehicle counting that is unaffected by obstacles or traffic jams. LSTM models capture how a car moves in time to forecast future positions. Combining DenseNet and SuperPoint embeddings that were improved with an AutoEncoder is done during feature extraction. In the end, using an attention function, Vision Transformer-based models classify vehicles seen from above. Every part of the system is developed and included to give the improved performance when the UAV is being used in real life.ResultsOur proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of vehicle analysis from UAV imagery. Our pipeline was rigorously evaluated on two famous datasets, AU-AIR and Roundabout. On the AU-AIR dataset, the system achieved a detection accuracy of 97.8%, a tracking accuracy of 96.5%, and a classification accuracy of 98.4%. Similarly, on the Roundabout dataset, it reached 96.9% detection accuracy, 94.4% tracking accuracy, and 97.7% classification accuracy. These results surpass previous benchmarks, demonstrating the system\u2019s robust performance across diverse aerial traffic scenarios. The integration of advanced models, YOLOv11 for detection, HRNet for segmentation, Deep SORT for tracking, CSRNet for counting, LSTM for trajectory prediction, and Vision Transformers for classification enables the framework to maintain high accuracy even under challenging conditions like occlusion, variable lighting, and scale variations.DiscussionThe outcomes show that the chosen deep learning system is powerful enough to deal with the challenges of aerial vehicle analysis and gives reliable and precise results in all the aforementioned tasks. Combining several advanced models ensures that the system works smoothly even when dealing with problems like people being covered up and varying sizes.",

    "content": "In deep-sea areas, the hoisting operation of offshore wind turbines is seriously affected by waves, and the secondary impact is prone to occur between the turbine and the pile foundation. To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated wave compensation system for offshore wind turbines based on a neuromorphic vision (NeuroVI) camera. The system employs a NeuroVI camera to achieve non-contact, high-precision, and low-latency displacement detection of hydraulic cylinders, overcoming the limitations of traditional magnetostrictive displacement sensors, which exhibit slow response and susceptibility to interference in harsh marine conditions. A dynamic simulation model was developed using AMESim-Simulink co-simulation to analyze the compensation performance of the NeuroVI-based system under step and sinusoidal wave disturbances. Comparative results demonstrate that the NeuroVI feedback system achieves faster response times and superior stability over conventional sensors. Laboratory-scale model tests and real-world application in the installation of a 5.2\u202fMW offshore wind turbine validated the system\u2019s feasibility and robustness, enabling real-time collaborative control of turbine and cylinder displacement to effectively mitigate multi-impact risks. This research provides an innovative approach for deploying neural perception technology in complex marine scenarios and advances the development of neuro-robotic systems in ocean engineering.",

    "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",
