These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "content": "Objective. Chronic pain affects over 20% of the adult population in the United States, posing a substantial personal as well as economic burden and contributing to the ongoing opioid crisis. Effective, non-addictive chronic pain treatments are urgently needed. Traditional drug discovery methods have failed to identify novel, non-addictive compounds, highlighting the need for alternative approaches such as phenotypic screening. Our lab developed a phenotypic screening assay using extracellular electrophysiological recordings from co-cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cell sensory neurons and glia. This study aimed to identify responsive neuronal subtypes within these presumptively heterogeneous cultures. Approach. We induced an inflammation-like state using tumor necrosis factor alpha and evaluated acute responses to nociceptor agonist capsaicin, which targets transient receptor potential vanilloid-1. By employing unsupervised learning, we labeled responsive cells based on changes in mean firing rates (MFR). We then used the labeled cells\u2019 baseline activity to train and validate five classifiers. Main results. None of the classifiers outperformed the others in regards to accuracy. Nonetheless, an RUS-boosted ensemble of decision trees achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.877 classifying nociceptors in an unseen labeled culture. Significance.

    "title": "Spec2VolCAMU-Net: a spectrogram-to-volume model for EEG-to-fMRI reconstruction based on Multi-directional Time\u2013Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder and Vision-Mamba U-Net",
    "content": "Objective. High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain convolutional neural networks that fail to capture cross-channel time\u2013frequency cues or on heavy transformer/generative adversarial network decoders that strain memory and stability. Approach. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time\u2013Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modeling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series. Main results. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. Significance. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The code is available at https://github.com/hdy6438/Spec2VolCAMU-Net.",

    "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

    "content": "Although the difference between consonance and dissonance has raised interest for decades in various fields of science, isolated chords are still underutilised as standardised affective stimuli in neuroscience. In the present study, we assessed whether consonant, dissonant, and neutral sounds evoked different subjective and neurophysiological responses associated with the emotional experience. For the first time, we conducted a comprehensive study of piano timbre chord perception, combining behavioural assessments, event-related potentials (ERPs), frequency-domain electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of amplitude, neurodynamic (longrange temporal correlations (LRTC)) factors, and source analysis. In an experiment, 30 participants rated the valence of sounds (consonance, dissonance, neutral) whilst simultaneously undergoing EEG recordings. At the behavioural level, a stable valence gradient was revealed: consonance was perceived as pleasant, dissonance as unpleasant, and the neutral group of stimuli as neutral. Analysis of ERPs revealed differences in response across three time windows (90\u2013110\u202fms, 190\u2013210\u202fms, 290\u2013310\u202fms) and activation of frontotemporal and temporoparietal areas during the processing of dissonant chords. At the level of frequency and neurodynamic indices (gamma and beta bands amplitudes and LRTC), we demonstrated that classification accuracy depends on the interaction between chord type and the EEG\u2019s amplitude- and scale-invariant characteristics for dissonant and neutral stimuli. These results provide evidence that isolated chords evoke differentiated emotional and cognitive responses, highlighting their potential utility as affective stimuli in future studies.",

    "content": "This study investigated the correlation between subjective preferences for different cosmetic formulations and brain activity measured using electroencephalography (EEG). EEG data were collected from 29 participants when they applied three positive and one negative cosmetic formulation to the inside of their left forearms. According to the questionnaire results, the negative formulation showed significantly lower preference scores than the positive formulations. Additionally, significant EEG-preference correlations were consistently found in the delta and alpha bands within the sensorimotor areas closely related to tactile processing and its emotional regulation. In particular, stronger correlations were observed when only the two positive formulations with higher preferences were included in the analysis or when specific frequency bands showing significant results were combined together. These findings demonstrate the potential of predicting cosmetic preferences based on EEG data and highlight the crucial role of texture sensation in shaping user choice.",

    "title": "CPRSCA-ResNet: a novel ResNet-based model with Channel-Partitioned Resolution Spatial-Channel Attention for EEG-based seizure detection",
    "content": "Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder caused by abnormal discharges of brain neurons, characterized by transient disturbances in consciousness, motor function, behavior, or sensation. Recurrent seizures severely impair patients\u2019 cognitive and physiological functions and increase the risk of accidental injury and premature death. Currently, clinical diagnosis of epilepsy mainly relies on manual interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, but traditional methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and susceptible to noise interference, highlighting the urgent need for efficient and accurate automated detection models. To address this, a novel Channel-Partitioned Resolution Spatial-Channel Attention (CPRSCA) mechanism was proposed in this study, and a CPRSCA-ResNet automatic seizure detection model was developed based on the ResNet-34 architecture. By incorporating fine-grained channel partitioning, multi-scale feature fusion, and multi-dimensional attention mechanisms, the proposed approach significantly enhances the precise representation of complex EEG features. Patient-dependent and patient-independent seizure detection experiments were conducted on the public CHB-MIT dataset and two local hospital datasets (JHCH and JHMCHH). The results show that, in patient-dependent experiments, the proposed model achieved accuracies of 99.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.09%, 96.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.64%, and 98.84\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.75% on the three datasets, while in patient-independent experiments, accuracies reached 78.71\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.06%, 87.15\u202f\u00b1\u202f15.32%, and 89.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.87%, respectively. These metrics consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the effectiveness and generalizability of the CPRSCA mechanism for automatic seizure detection. In summary, the proposed method provides an efficient, robust, and highly generalizable technical solution for auxiliary clinical diagnosis of epilepsy, with the potential to substantially reduce the burden of manual EEG interpretation and improve the diagnostic efficiency for patients with epilepsy.",

    "title": "A multi-domain graph convolutional network-based prediction model for personalized motor imagery action",
    "content": "Motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a novel method to decode action imagination. Our previous study demonstrated that actions play a key role in causing individual differences. Cognitive EEG signals showed a positive correlation with MI, reflecting these differences and providing a foundation for predicting suitable MI actions for each individual. This study aimed to propose a multi-domain graph convolutional network (M-GCN) for predicting personalized MI action using cognitive data. The M-GCN extracts time, frequency, and spatial domain features from cognitive tasks to construct multi-domain brain networks using different EEG quantization methods according to the characteristics of the three domains. Subsequently, the M-GCN utilizes spectral GCN to learn the topology relationship between EEG channels by analyzing functional connection strength. Finally, for each action, the M-GCN can accurately map cognitive data to the corresponding MI action and output a personalized action for each subject. A subject-independent decoding paradigm with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation is adopted to validate the model on ten subjects. Compared to baseline and single-domain models, the M-GCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 73.60% (p = 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22123), improving by 15.87% (p = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22124) and by 7.2% (p = 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124), respectively. This study proves that the M-GCN can precisely predict personalized MI actions, reflecting the efficiency of the multi-domain feature fusion based on cognitive tasks and GCN and offering a novel method for personalized BCI.",

    "title": "Aligning machines and minds: neural encoding for high-level visual cortices based on image captioning task",
    "content": "Objective. Neural encoding of visual stimuli aims to predict brain responses in the visual cortex to different external inputs. Deep neural networks trained on relatively simple tasks such as image classification have been widely applied in neural encoding studies of early visual areas. However, due to the complex and abstract nature of semantic representations in high-level visual cortices, their encoding performance and interpretability remain limited. Approach. We propose a novel neural encoding model guided by the image captioning task. During image captioning, an attention module is employed to focus on key visual objects. In the neural encoding stage, a flexible receptive field (RF) module is designed to simulate voxel-level visual fields. To bridge the domain gap between these two processes, we introduce the Atten-RF module, which effectively aligns attention-guided visual representations with voxel-wise brain activity patterns. Main results. Experiments on the large-scale natural scenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior average encoding performance across seven high-level visual cortices, with a mean squared error of 0.765, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.443, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.245. Significance. By leveraging the guidance and alignment provided by a complex vision-language task, our model enhances the prediction of voxel activity in high-level visual cortex, offering a new perspective on the neural encoding problem. Furthermore, various visualization techniques provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual information processing.",

    "content": "Objective. Precise electrophysiological recordings and stimulation of deep brain structures in large animal models such as non-human primates require highly accurate targeting methods that are currently lacking. Approach. To address this limitation, we have integrated advanced multi-camera neuronavigation, high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography), and tailored surgical methods to chronically implant electrodes in deep structures of the macaque brain, with an accuracy below or at the millimeter scale. Main results. We first illustrate the advantage of multi-camera neuronavigation over traditional two-camera systems in 3D-printed head models, demonstrating that a submillimeter accuracy requires at least five cameras. We then introduce a detailed experimental protocol using skull-based registration for reaching submillimeter accuracies in vivo. This protocol was optimized and tested in three macaque monkeys across seven implantations targeting the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex, including five performed with skull-based registration. Next, we quantify our targeting accuracy for these two structures by in vivo neuroimaging and histological analyses. We show that our skull-based registration procedure enabled to target the entorhinal cortex with submillimetric accuracy (0.55 mm and 0.89 mm in two animals), while implantation errors for the hippocampus were slightly higher (1.11 mm and 1.68 mm in two animals). Finally, we validate our approach with electrophysiological recordings of these targeted structures during drowsiness and stimulation-induced epileptiform afterdischarges in two chronically implanted animals. Significance. This technological and surgical framework provides a means to record and stimulate deep brain structures in large animal models with submillimetric to millimetric accuracy.",

    "content": "Objective. Accurate detection and classification of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have become increasingly important for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, few open-source platforms offer both state-of-the-art computational methods and user-friendly interfaces to support practical clinical use. Approach. We present PyHFO 2.0, an enhanced open-source, Python-based platform that extends previous work by incorporating a more comprehensive set of detection methods and deep learning (DL) tools for HFO analysis. The platform now supports three commonly used detectors: short-term energy, Montreal Neurological Institute, and a newly integrated Hilbert transform-based detector. For HFO classification, PyHFO 2.0 includes DL models for artifact rejection, spike HFO detection, and identification of epileptogenic HFOs. These models are integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem for automatic loading and can be replaced with custom-trained alternatives. An interactive annotation module enables clinicians and researchers to inspect, verify, and reclassify events. Main results. All detection and classification modules were evaluated using clinical EEG datasets, supporting the applicability of the platform in both research and translational settings. Validation across multiple datasets demonstrated close alignment with expert-labeled annotations and standard tools such as RIPPLELAB. Significance.

    "title": "A methodological framework for the efficient characterization of peripheral nerve stimulation parameters",
    "content": "Objective. Restoring movement and somatosensation with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) requires precise neural activation. Because pulse amplitude (PA) and pulse width (PW) recruit axons differently, intentionally modulating both could enable more advanced PNS. However, mapping the PA-PW space is currently prohibitively time-intensive. This paper proposes and clinically validates an efficient method to characterize multiple intensities in the PA-PW space for motor and perceptual sensory applications using minimal data collection. Approach. We used cuff electrodes implanted in one participant with a spinal cord injury to generate iso-EMG activation contours and two participants with upper limb loss to generate somatosensory perceptual iso-intensity contours in the PA-PW space. Strength-duration (SD) curves were mapped to the contours using varying sample point subsets and assessed for fit quality. Finite element modeling of a human nerve and activation simulations evaluated differences in recruited axon populations across the PA-PW space. Main results. SD curves accurately fit all levels of motor activation and perceptual intensity (median and , respectively). Reliable estimates of SD curves at any intensity require only two sufficiently-spaced points (motor , sensory ). Using this data, we present and validate a novel method for efficiently characterizing the PA-PW space using SD curves, including a metric that quantifies mapping accuracy based on two sampled points. In silico, intensity-matched high-PW and high-PA stimulation recruited overlapping, but not equivalent, axon sets, with high-PA stimuli preferentially recruiting large-diameter fibers and axons farther from the contact. Significance. This method enables rapid, accurate mapping of the stimulation parameter space for clinical motor and sensory PNS. The efficiency of the proposed characterization approach enhances the clinical feasibility of multiparameter modulation, establishing a framework for further exploration of two-parameter modulation for increased selectivity and resolution, reduced fatigue, and unique percept generation.

    "title": "Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for In Vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Data",
    "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

    "content": "While machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to detection and prediction tasks in clinical data, most methods rely on high-resolution data, which is not routinely available in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and perform poorly when faced with class imbalance. Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

    "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger).

Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

    "content": "The open-source development model has been successfully applied to consumer and enterprise software, and recently to consumer hardware. Medical devices may become a beneficiary of this trend, as open-source medical device development has the potential to reduce costs, democratize patient access, and provide continued support to abandoned devices from failed companies. Unlike the consumer device market, the medical device market is highly regulated and involves considerable manufacturer liability that may limit the use of open-source technology. This review of open-source medical device development explores the current state of development in research and clinical products and suggests best practices for creating sustainable and effective open-source medical devices.",

    "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
    "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems.

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Objective. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. This represents a paradigm shift in the analysis of neural data to overcome the inherent limitations of static assumptions about functional brain connectivity. By exploiting the information provided by high temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the possibility of tracking functional network organization and reconfiguration that support brain functions at different temporal scales has been extensively explored. Approach. This review examines the current state-of-the-art of the methodological approaches for dFC analysis in biomedical science, focusing on literature from 2018 to 2024 and on the analysis of EEG and MEG data. The review primarily concentrates on methods for estimating the time-resolved functional connectivity matrix, also providing an overview of approaches for summarising and inferring dynamic information. Main results. An insight into the available methodological approaches for tracking dFC at different temporal scales is offered. Besides the classical sliding window method, advances in instantaneous dFC algorithms are described and two novel approaches are introduced: microstate-based dFC (micro-dFC) and data-driven dFC methods. For each approach, specific features are detailed, and the dataset characteristics to ensure applicability are discussed. In addition, possible post-processing procedures for extracting the dynamic properties and information of interest are presented. Significance. The undoubted potential of dFC analysis for the study of brain dynamics is highlighted, providing a guide for its application, also taking into consideration the study protocol, the nature of the data and the temporal resolution of interest. Current limitations and open challenges are also critically addressed.",

    "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
    "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

    "title": "Neuralace: manufacture, parylene-C coating, and mechanical properties",
    "content": "Objective. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type subdural electrode array, to characterize its mechanical compatibility with neural tissue (i.e., the forces exerted onto the brain upon conformation) for chronic brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A full-factorial design of experiments was used to assess the effects of geometrical variations, orientation, and polymeric encapsulation on the stiffness of silicon-based Neuralace structures. A custom low-force four-point bending setup was developed to measure flexural stiffness in a physiologically relevant displacement range. Main results. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N m\u22121 to 7.21 N m\u22121, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, orientation, and parylene-C (PPXC) encapsulation. Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10\u2013100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the brain\u2019s topology (considering a 60 mm radius of the gyrus). Significance. Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. These arrays are now transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs, which requires consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study establishes a rigorous and reproducible framework for mechanical characterization of conformable neural implants and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning design parameters to reduce implant-induced mechanical stress on cortical tissue. The results support future development of chronic BCI-compatible subdural electrodes with improved biocompatibility through mechanical design.",

    "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
    "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

    "title": "The Neuroprotective Effects of Ocimum gratissimum-Supplemented Diet on Scopolamine-Induced Memory Impairment in Mice Model of Alzheimer's Disease",
    "content": "Background: Cognitive decline is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative illness primarily caused by the buildup of amyloid plaque, which is brought on by oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Currently, therapeutic agents are focused on addressing clinical symptoms with associated side effects. This study aims to explore the neuroprotective potential of Ocimum gratissimum, a plant known for its richness in bioactive compounds. By investigating its effects on cognitive health, this study addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding dietary interventions for Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Thirty-six animals were divided into six groups of six mice each: the control group received distilled water intraperitoneally; the scopolamine group received only scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); the three test groups were fed 5%, 10%, and 20% Ocimum gratissimum-supplemented diets while also receiving scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); and the positive control group received Donepezil (5 mg/kg) followed by the injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.). Donepezil was administered orally 30 minutes before the scopolamine injection. All treatments were administered daily for 14 consecutive days. Results: The supplemented diet groups showed significantly improved spatial memory and navigation compared to the scopolamine-only group. Biochemical analyses revealed that O. gratissimum mitigated scopolamine-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, with marked improvements in antioxidant enzyme levels, reduced lipid peroxidation, and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: Dietary intervention using Ocimum gratissimum leaf was able to improve spatial memory and protect against memory impairment, suggesting its potential as a neuroprotective agent against Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.",

We identify cerebrospinal fluid fibrinogen as a marker of brain thromboinflammation and screen neurovascular biosignatures mediating its impact on synaptic vulnerability along the full spectrum of brain aging from cognitively typical, amyloid-negative to cognitively impaired, amyloid-positive older adults. We identified 53 proteins mediating the effect of fibrinogen on synaptic markers in 1,655 donors from three independent cohorts. Single-cell transcriptomic mapping revealed mediator enrichment in neurovascular unit cells. Pathway analysis demonstrated dysregulation of angiogenesis, fibrosis, and immune signaling. Vascular and microglial-enriched biosignatures associated with compromised white matter integrity.

    "title": "Frontal and Parietal Contributions to Proprioception and Motor Skill Learning",
    "content": "Motor skill learning is the process of developing new movements with practice until they can be performed automatically. This necessitates the interaction of high-level cognitive processes with low-level sensorimotor mechanisms. Skill learning involves not only changes in the motor system but also proprioception (position sense). Proprioceptive deficits increase variability and decrease accuracy of movement. The somatosensory cortex, where low-level proprioception is processed, is known to play a role in motor skill learning, but the involvement of higher-level proprioceptive regions is unclear. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been linked to the high-level early stages of motor learning, and indirectly to proprioception. Supramarginal gyrus (SMG), an interface area between motor and sensory cortices, has been linked to higher-order proprioceptive processing. In this study, we asked how activity in DLPFC and SMG influences motor skill learning. Participants learned an upper limb motor skill designed to be spatially complex and dependent on proprioception: tracing a two-dimensional maze as accurately as possible within the desired speed range, using a Kinarm Endpoint robotic manipulandum. Proprioceptive acuity (sensitivity and bias) was assessed before and after continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) was applied to inhibit activity in DLPFC, SMG, or Sham. To measure motor skill, movement accuracy and variability were examined at the trained speed as well as at a faster (more difficult) and a slower (easier) speed. Skill was assessed before and after cTBS, after 40 training trials (early learning) and after another 80 trials (late learning). All three groups showed improvements in movement accuracy and variance, indicating they learned the maze tracing skill. However, the Sham group improved movement variability at the faster speed significantly more than the DLPFC or SMG groups did. This suggests that DLPFC and SMG are important for the more challenging aspects of motor skill learning, consistent with their association with higher-level proprioceptive function.",

    "content": "De novo protein synthesis is required for long-lasting synaptic plasticity and memory, but it comes with a great metabolic cost. In the mammalian brain, it remains unclear which cell types and biological mechanisms are critical for sensing and responding to increased metabolic demand. Here we demonstrate that microglia, resident macrophages of the brain, coordinate metabolic coupling between endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons to fuel protein synthesis in active neurons. Increasing metabolic demand via a motor task stimulates microglia to secrete the hypoxia-responsive protein CYR61, increasing glucose transporter expression in brain vasculature. Depleting microglia reduces training-induced metabolic fluxes and neuronal protein synthesis, which can be reproduced by blocking CYR61 signaling. Thus, we define a neuroimmune metabolic circuit required for on-demand protein synthesis in mouse motor cortex.",

    "title": "Extracellular space diffusion modelling identifies distinct functional advantages of archetypical glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse geometries",
    "content": "The brain extracellular space (ECS) is a convoluted compartment of nano- and microscale interconnected ducts. A key step in signaling between neural cells is diffusion of signaling molecules through the ECS, yet, signaling is generally considered solely from the stance of cells and their properties. Where ECS diffusion is addressed, this is commonly done using volume-averaging techniques blind to individual signaling events and ECS geometry. We hypothesized that ECS geometry can shape local diffusion and thereby tune signaling arising from point-sources. To access the scale of individual transmitter release events and synapse geometries, we developed a computational diffusion model, DifFlux, based on super-resolved images of hippocampal ECS in live mouse brain slices and combined this with single molecule Monte Carlo diffusion simulations. Our approach allows us to simulate diffusion of molecules of our choosing in true live ECS geometries. We asked how the ECS shapes local diffusion in dense neuropil and along larger cellular processes in CA1 stratum radiatum. We observed local diffusional anisotropy and directionality imposed by ECS geometry. Further, we identified distinct functional advantages of dendritic spine and somatodendritic synapse ECS geometries, shedding light on the longstanding conundrum of why glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses are so conspicuously morphologically different. Our modelling broadly identifies ECS structure as a direct modulator of extrasynaptic signaling that can operate in parallel to conventional regulation mechanisms.",

    "title": "Natural Scene Coding Consistency in Genetically-Defined Cell Populations",
    "content": "Understanding how genetically-defined cell populations encode visual information remains a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. While extensive research has characterized individual cell responses to simple stimuli such as static gratings, the population-level coding principles that govern naturalistic visual processing across cell types remain largely unexplored. We analyzed population responses from 43,018 neurons across 12 genetically-defined cell types in 243 mice from the Allen Brain Observatory, comparing representational geometry between natural scenes and static gratings. We found that inhibitory cell populations (VIP, SST, PV) cluster distinctly in representational space almost independent of anatomical location when responding to natural scenes but not static gratings, suggesting preserved cell-type specific computational functions specific for natural scenes. To assess coding capacity of a population of neurons, we developed Inter-Individual Representational Similarity (IIRS), which measures consistency of neural representations across different individuals in response to an ensemble of stimuli. All inhibitory populations showed significantly higher IIRS for natural scenes compared to static gratings, indicating consistent encoding of naturalistic visual features across individuals comparable to excitatory populations (Cux2, Rorb, Rbp4). Parallel analysis of neural networks trained on natural images (ImageNet) with different random initializations revealed similar patterns: models showed higher cross-initialization similarity for naturalistic stimuli compared to static gratings, suggesting that cross-individual consistency emerges when experimental stimuli engage the features that neural circuits are adapted to extract. These findings establish IIRS as a metric for identifying coding capacity in cell populations and reveal that inhibitory cell populations encode consistent aspects of natural scenes across individuals, indicating these circuits may have evolved specialized tuning for naturalistic visual environments.",

    "title": "Global organisation of structural covariance networks derived from parcellated cortical surface area in atypical populations.",
    "content": "Higher-order features of brain organisation are powerful measures for understanding the relationship between brain and experience. In particular, the global arrangement of structural features of the cortex provides insight into neurodevelopmental processes that underlie individual differences in perception and cognition. Structural covariance networks (SCNs), which capture regional coordination of brain morphometry, are an efficient method to derive global properties of the cortex. However, their interpretation relies on an array of methodological choices that are often inconsistent between studies. Using a hierarchically-clustered version of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) atlas, we constructed SCNs of regional cortical surface area for groups with four different conditions -- synaesthesia, autism, early psychosis, and anxiety or depression -- and compared global network properties with those of age- and sex-matched controls. SCNs for synaesthesia and autism showed globally stronger connectivity, with specific increases at moderate cortical distances, as well as lower network complexity. Conversely, the SCN for early psychosis showed a globally lower connectivity and a greater complexity, while depression and anxiety showed few differences compared to controls. The results for autism and depression were replicated across two datasets each. These findings support the notion that synaesthesia and autism share neurodevelopmental mechanisms, while psychosis may involve a diverging process. This study is also an important proof of principle for analysing diverse populations under one methodological framework.",

    "title": "Social Reward Learning Deficits and Concordant Brain Alterations in Rats Overexpressing Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)",
    "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",

Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Out of the box it supports copy, move, delete, fast_copy and zip actions.</p> <p>It is also VERY/sort-of easy to sub-class filters that can look into the contents of files to add data about the file itself (rather than the metadata), perhaps looking for ERROR lines in todays logs, or image files that have 24 bit color. For these types of filters it can be important to use the built in multithreading for sharing the load of reading into all of those files. </p> <p>```python from pathql import AgeDays, Size, Suffix, Query,ResultField</p> <h1>Count, largest file size, and oldest file from the last 24 hours in the result set</h1> <p>query = Query( where_expr=(AgeDays() == 0) &amp; (Size() &gt; &quot;10 mb&quot;) &amp; Suffix(&quot;log&quot;), from_paths=&quot;C:/logs&quot;, threaded=True ) result_set = query.select()</p> <h1>Show stats from matches</h1> <p>print(f&quot;Number of files to zip: {result<em>set.count</em>()}&quot;) print(f&quot;Largest file size: {result_set.max(ResultField.SIZE)} bytes&quot;) print(f&quot;Oldest file: {result_set.min(ResultField.MTIME)}&quot;) ```</p> <p>And a more complex example</p> <p>```python from pathql import Suffix, Size, AgeDays, Query, zip_move_files</p> <h1>Define the root directory for relative paths in the zip archive</h1> <p>root_dir = &quot;C:/logs&quot;</p> <h1>Find all .log files larger than 5MB and modified &gt; 7 days ago</h1> <p>query = Query( where_expr=(Suffix(&quot;.log&quot;) &amp; (Size() &gt; &quot;5 mb&quot;) &amp; (AgeDays() &gt; 7)), from_paths=root_dir ) result_set = query.select()</p> <h1>Zip all matching files into 'logs_archive.zip' (preserving structure under root)</h1> <h1>Then move them to 'C:/logs/archive'</h1> <p>zip_move_files( result_set, target_zip=&quot;logs_archive.zip&quot;, move_target=&quot;C:/logs/archive&quot;, root=root_dir, preserve_dir_structure=True )</p> <p>print(&quot;Zipped and moved files:&quot;, [str(f) for f in result_set])</p> <p>```</p> <p>Support for querying on <code>Age</code>, <code>File</code>, <code>Suffix</code>, <code>Stem</code>, <code>Read</code>/<code>Write</code>/<code>Exec</code>, modified/created/accessed, <code>Size</code>, <code>Year</code>/<code>Month</code>/<code>Day</code>/<code>HourFilter</code> with compact syntax as well as aggregation support for <code>count_</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>top_n</code>, <code>bot_n</code>, <code>median</code> functions that may be applied to standard <code>os.stat</code> fields.</p> <p>GitHub:<a href=\"https://github.com/hucker/pathql\">https://github.com/hucker/pathql</a></p> <p>Test coverage on the <code>src</code> folder is 85% with 500+ tests.</p> <p>\ud83c\udfaf Target Audience</p> <p>Developers who make tools to manage processes that generate large numbers of files that need to be managed, and just generally hate dealing with <code>datetime</code>, <code>timestamp</code> and other <code>os.stat</code> ad-hackery. </p> <p>\ud83c\udfaf Comparison</p> <p>I have not found something that does what <code>PathQL</code> does beyond directly using <code>pathlib</code> and <code>os</code> and hand rolling your own predicates using a <code>pathlib</code> <code>glob</code>/<code>rglob</code> crawler.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayEmphasis4345\"> /u/HolidayEmphasis4345 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ojgqmr/pathql_a_declarative_sql_like_layer_for_pathlib/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ojgqmr/pathql_a_declarative_sql_like_layer_for_pathlib/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<p>The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as two male nonhuman primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power, gamma (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. In contrast, alpha (10&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz) power, theta (4&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active handoff of information between hemispheres. This \"handshaking\" operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite advances in understanding the psychological and social consequences of peer victimization, the immediate effects of bullying on the central nervous system remain elusive. Here we mapped the neural, affective, and attentional responses to simulated bullying in adolescents and adults and tested whether these responses are associated with real-life victimization experiences. Fifty-one adolescents (29 females, 22 males) aged 11&ndash;14&nbsp;years and 47 adults (29 females, 18 males) underwent a functional MRI (fMRI) while watching first-person videos of bullying (victimization) in the school environment, as well as neutral and positive social interactions in a similar setting. Additionally, 57 adults (36 females, 21 males) watched the same videos during an eye tracking experiment. Exposure to bullying versus positive social interaction engaged the socioemotional and threat response systems, as well as regions related to social cognition, sensory and interoceptive processing, and motor control. These responses were consistent across adolescents and adults and were associated with the current and past victimization experiences of the participants. This large-scale activation of neural systems subserving socioemotional, somatosensory, and interoceptive processing was in line with the amplified emotional and attentional responses revealed by larger pupil size and higher fixation frequency during simulated bullying in the eye tracking experiment. Altogether these results highlight how peer victimization evokes a state of stress and alarm in the central nervous system.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Spatial attention is often conceptualized as a flexible \"zoom lens\" that can dynamically adjust its focus, but most evidence stems from studies of voluntary attention. Our study investigates whether involuntary, reflexive attention exhibits similar adaptability in attentional scope. Using behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) experiments with exogenous cues of varying spatial extent, we examined how attentional gradients dynamically adjust when attention is involuntarily captured. Male and female human participants performed visual search tasks preceded by narrow- or broad-cue displays at different onset asynchronies. We applied inverted encoding models to alpha-band neural activity to precisely track the locus and breadth of attentional tuning. Across experiments, we found that reflexive attentional gradients flexibly adapt to match cue characteristics. Behaviorally, narrow cues yielded progressively sharper attentional gradients compared with broad cues, with differences emerging over time. Critically, EEG analyses revealed that alpha-band activity tracked these dynamic adjustments, with differences in spatial selectivity emerging rapidly (&plusmn;200&nbsp;ms postcue) and continuing to evolve. Contrary to previous suggestions that involuntary attention primarily influences response efficiency, our results demonstrate that exogenous cues modulate attentional resources across the visual field at early processing stages.</p>",

    "title": "Rebound Bursting Selectively Enables Fast Dynamics in Dopamine Midbrain Neurons Projecting to the Dorsolateral Striatum",
    "content": "<p>Dopamine (DA) midbrain neurons are involved in a wide array of key brain functions including movement control and reward-based learning. They are also critical for major brain disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease or schizophrenia. DA neurons projecting to distinct striatal territories are diverse with regard to their molecular makeup and cellular physiology, which are likely to contribute to the observed differences in temporal DA dynamics. Among these regions, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) displays the fastest DA dynamics, which might control the moment-to-moment vigor and variability of voluntary movements. However, the underlying mechanisms for these DLS-specific fast DA fluctuations are unresolved. Here, we show that DLS-projecting DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) possess a unique biophysical profile allowing immediate 10-fold accelerations in discharge frequency via rebound bursting. By using a combination of in vitro patch-clamp recordings in projection-defined DA SN subpopulations from adult male mice and developing matching projection-specific computational models, we demonstrate that a strong interaction of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 and SK channels specific for DLS-projecting Aldh1a1&ndash;positive DA SN (DLS-DA) neurons controls the gain of fast rebound bursting, while K<sub>v</sub>4 and HCN channels mediate timing of rebound excitability. In addition, GIRK channels activated by D2 and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors prevent rebound bursting in these DLS-DA neurons. Furthermore, our in vivo patch-clamp recordings and matching in vivo computational models provide evidence that these unique rebound properties might be preserved in the intact brain, where they might endow specific computational properties well suited for the generation of fast DA dynamics present in DLS.</p>",

    "title": "Linking Connectivity Dynamics to Symptom Severity and Cognitive Abilities in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: An FNIRS Study",
    "content": "<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating neurobiological markers in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While previous studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in ASD children compared with typically developing (TD) peers, brain connectivity dynamics and their associations with autism symptoms and cognitive abilities remain underexplored. We analyzed fNIRS data from 44 children (30 boys, 21 ASD/23 TD) aged 2.08&ndash;6.67&nbsp;years while they viewed a silent cartoon. Using sliding window correlation and <i>k</i>-means clustering, we assessed group differences in dynamic connectivity and the correlations with symptom severity and cognitive performance. Our results revealed that children with ASD showed reduced dwell time in a specific brain state and fewer state transitions compared with TD children. These atypical brain state patterns were negatively correlated with autism symptom severity and positively correlated with adaptive behavior and cognitive performance across participants. Mediation analysis revealed that adaptive behavior fully mediated the relationship between brain dynamics and cognitive performance. Furthermore, dynamic connectivity features achieved 74.4% accuracy in distinguishing ASD from TD children. Importantly, the link between brain dynamics and cognitive performance was replicated in an independent TD sample, underscoring the robustness of this finding. Together, these findings highlight altered brain dynamics in young children with ASD and underscore the critical role of adaptive behavior in bridging neural activity and cognitive performance. These insights advance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying ASD and point to potential pathways for early interventions and clinical applications.</p>",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Lateral Na+ Diffusion in Apical Dendrites of Mouse CA1 Pyramidal Neurons",
    "content": "<p>Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are major charge carriers mediating neuronal excitation and play a fundamental role in brain physiology. Glutamatergic synaptic activity is accompanied by large transient Na<sup>+</sup> increases, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of Na<sup>+</sup> signals and properties of Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion within dendrites are largely unknown. To address these questions, we employed multiphoton Na<sup>+</sup> imaging combined with whole-cell patch clamp in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in tissue slices from mice of both sexes. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed a dendritic baseline Na<sup>+</sup> concentration of ~10&nbsp;mM. Using intensity-based line scan imaging, we found that local, glutamate-evoked Na<sup>+</sup> signals spread rapidly within dendrites, with peak amplitudes decreasing and latencies increasing with increasing distance from the site of stimulation. Spread of Na<sup>+</sup> along dendrites was independent of dendrite diameter, order, or overall spine density in the ranges measured. Our experiments also show that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> readily invades spines and suggest that spine necks may represent a partial diffusion barrier. Experimental data were well reproduced by mathematical simulations assuming normal diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of <i>D</i><sub>Na+</sub> = 600&nbsp;&micro;m<sup>2</sup>/s. Modeling moreover revealed that lateral diffusion is key for the clearance of local Na<sup>+</sup> increases at early time points, whereas when diffusional gradients are diminished, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase becomes more relevant. Taken together, our study thus demonstrates that Na<sup>+</sup> influx causes rapid lateral diffusion of Na<sup>+</sup> within spiny dendrites. This results in an efficient redistribution and fast recovery from local Na<sup>+</sup> transients which is mainly governed by concentration differences.</p>",

    "content": "<p>BLTP1 (Bridge-Like Lipid Transfer Protein Family Member 1), previously known as Tweek, Kiaa1109, FSA, or 4932438A13Rik, is a nonvesicular lipid transport protein linked to Alkuraya&ndash;Ku&#x010d;inskas syndrome (AKS), an autosomal recessive disorder with severe brain malformations and arthrogryposis in humans. Although BLTP1 is known to be involved in the transfer of phospholipids between organellar membranes at membrane contact sites, its specific role during mammalian development remains poorly defined. Here we characterized the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in <i>Bltp1</i> knock-out (<i>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></i>) mice of either sex. These mutant mice die perinatally, exhibiting reduced growth of intramuscular motor nerves and a reduction in the size of the NMJ, compared with littermate controls. Electrophysiological analysis of the diaphragm muscle in <i>Bltp1</i><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> embryos reveals defects in synaptic transmission at the NMJ. Notably, the frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release is markedly increased, whereas evoked neurotransmitter release and quantal content are reduced. In addition, neuromuscular synapses in <i>Bltp1</i><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice fail to respond to a repetitive stimulation. Remarkably, the impairment of intramuscular nerve growth in <i>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></i> embryos is restored by supplementing pregnant dams with lecithin, a mixture of unsaturated phospholipids naturally present in foods, although lecithin supplement does not improve the overall survival of these mutant mice. Together, these results demonstrate that BLTP1 plays important roles during development for proper intramuscular nerve growth and neuromuscular synaptic function and suggest that AKS patients may benefit from phospholipid supplementation such as lecithin.</p>",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

    "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

    "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

    "content": "IntroductionHypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare transsynaptic neurodegenerative disorder arising from disruption of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT), a neural circuit critical for motor coordination. Classical clinical presentation includes palatal tremor. While cerebrovascular etiology dominates reported cases, HOD secondary to intracranial infections remains poorly characterized, posing diagnostic challenges.Case presentationA 72-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension presented with a 7-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting. Initial neuroimaging revealed right cerebellar hematoma with multiple brain abscesses. Antibacterial treatment achieved symptomatic improvement, but follow-up was lost. Seven months later, readmission occurred due to memory decline and personality changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T2-weighted hyperintensity in the left anterior medulla oblongata and hemosiderosis in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Despite the absence of clinical manifestations of HOD, prior abscess-induced GMT involvement strongly supported the diagnosis. Symptomatic management stabilized the patient, with persistent lesions but no clinical progression at 5-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case documents a rare case of HOD following bacterial brain abscess, presenting with atypical clinical features. It expands the etiological spectrum of HOD and underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion in post-infectious neurological deterioration. Multimodal MRI facilitates early diagnosis and timely intervention, highlighting its critical role in managing this underrecognized entity.",

Early diagnosis remains challenging due to nonspecific initial symptoms.

All patients underwent at least one EEG examination. One representative patient was followed for 23\u202fweeks with serial EEG and MRI studies to document dynamic electrophysiological and structural changes. EEG background activity was graded as mild, moderate, or severe, and PSWCs were identified based on standardized criteria. MRI analyses focused on the spatial and temporal progression of hyperintense lesions on DWI and FLAIR sequences.ResultsAmong the 37 patients, 46% underwent initial EEG within 1\u202fmonth of symptom onset, and 49% exhibited severe background abnormalities. PSWCs were present in 84% of patients at first EEG, with a high prevalence (82%) even in those examined within 4\u202fweeks of onset. Longitudinal analysis in the index case revealed a progressive EEG deterioration: from slowed and disorganized background rhythms and emerging triphasic waves at 8\u202fweeks, to widespread PSWCs with increasing periodicity (9\u201316\u202fweeks), and finally to a burst-suppression pattern near electrical silence by week 23. Concurrent MRI showed a parallel expansion of hyperintense lesions from unilateral cortical and basal ganglia regions to bilateral involvement, closely correlated with the EEG progression. Statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between survival time and age, time to first EEG, CSF 14\u20133-3 protein status, or initial EEG background grade. Furthermore, neither the presence of typical PSWCs nor the severity of background activity was associated with survival outcomes.ConclusionEEG, especially the early and highly prevalent presence of PSWCs, offers high diagnostic value in sCJD but does not serve as prognostic predictors. The close correlation between EEG decline and MRI progression supports multimodal monitoring. Serial EEG should be integrated into sCJD diagnosis and follow-up.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "title": "White matter microstructure in mid- to late adulthood is influenced by pathway-stratified polygenic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
    "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease involves progressive white matter microstructural degeneration that may precede clinical symptoms by decades. While polygenic risk scores (PRS) quantify cumulative genetic liability for AD, genome-wide PRS lack mechanistic specificity. We tested whether pathway-specific PRS, targeting areas of biology including tau binding, lipid metabolism, and immune response, are differentially associated with diffusion MRI measures across the lifespan.MethodsWe analyzed two population-based cohorts: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; mean age = 19.8 years, n = 517) and UK Biobank (mean age = 64.2 years, n = 18,172). Genome-wide and nine pathway-specific PRS for Alzheimer\u2019s disease were constructed using GWAS summary statistics and a clumping threshold of r2 < 0.2 at p < 0.001. Diffusion MRI data were processed separately within each cohort: in ALSPAC, tract-based fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted using probabilistic tractography from native-space regions of interest; in UK Biobank, diffusion metrics were derived from TBSS-aligned skeletons and standard atlas-based ROIs. Analyses focused on three tracts vulnerable to early AD pathology: the dorsal cingulum, parahippocampal cingulum, and fornix. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess PRS associations with FA and MD, adjusting for demographic, scanner, and genetic ancestry covariates. False discovery rate correction addressed multiple comparisons, and sensitivity analyses were performed excluding the APOE region.ResultsIn UK Biobank, higher PRS for protein\u2013lipid complex assembly and tau protein binding were robustly associated with lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity in both dorsal and parahippocampal cingulum segments (False discovery rate-corrected p < 0.05), explaining more variance than APOE alone; no significant effects emerged in the fornix. Genome-wide PRS showed weaker, non-significant associations. In ALSPAC, no PRS metric survived FDR correction, though nominal trends appeared in the dorsal cingulum. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that key cingulum associations in older adults persisted after omitting APOE.ConclusionPathway-specific polygenic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease manifests in white matter microstructure by mid- to late adulthood but not in early adulthood, suggesting an age-dependent emergence of genetic effects. dMRI phenotypes may thus serve as intermediate biomarkers for dissecting mechanistic pathways of preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease vulnerability.",

    "title": "Localization performance of cochlear implant users with a real-time bilaterally-synchronized sound coding strategy that provides explicit interaural timing cues with mixed rates of stimulation",
    "content": "IntroductionBilateral cochlear implants (BiCIs) do not restore sound localization abilities to the full extent exhibited by typical hearing (TH) listeners, partly due to poor encoding of interaural time differences (ITDs). ITD cues have been provided and investigated using synchronized research processors that ensure the precise delivery of ITD cues. These studies have been conducted in a direct stimulation setting, which bypasses the processor microphones and, in most cases, removes interaural level difference cues (ILDs). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated the efficacy of synchronized stimulation in restoring sensitivity to ITDs in a free field localization experiment. This was made possible by the CCi-MOBILE, a portable and real-time processing research platform that allows for synchronizing microphone inputs.MethodsFourteen BiCI listeners were tested with experimental real-time coding strategies in comparison to unsynchronized clinical processors. We calculated the binaural cues from the acoustic stimuli at the level of microphone input.ResultsThe recordings show that the experimental coding strategies in this study deliver ITDs with greater precision than the clinical strategy. However, psychophysical testing did not show the benefit of an ITD-encoding strategy in improving localization in a free field. The ITD encoding strategies preserved ITDs, which better differentiated unique loudspeaker locations than interaural level differences (ILDs), suggesting that listeners could achieve improved performance if they accessed these cues. As expected, ILDs were similar across all strategies, including the ITD encoding strategies. The lack of improvement in localization performance is likely because ILDs remained to be the dominant cue in acute localization testing, even when ITD cues were available.DiscussionProviding BiCI listeners with adequate experiences with ITD cues may be necessary to shift their reliance from ILD dominance to a combined reliance on ILD and ITD cues in free-field conditions. The CCi-MOBILE could enable take-home practice with novel stimulation strategies for extended experiences and long-term evaluation in real-world listening environments.",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

    "title": "Gaze Graphs in spatial navigation: visual behavior during free exploration explains individual differences in navigation performance",
    "content": "Vision is an important sense for spatial navigation, yet little is known about the role of visual behavior during spatial knowledge acquisition and its link to spatial navigation performance. In this study, participants freely explored the immersive virtual reality city of Westbrook while eye-tracking data were collected. Subsequently, participants' spatial knowledge was tested in an immersive pointing-to-building task. To address the freedom of movement during the spatial exploration, we transformed the eye-tracking data into gaze graphs and applied a graph-theoretical analysis. We assessed gaze graph architecture and identified gaze-graph-defined landmarks, finding that their properties were consistent with key results from our earlier work. Furthermore, we investigated which factors contribute to the observed individual differences in spatial navigation performance. We found that global gaze graph measures, specifically gaze graph diameter, could explain 40% of the observed individual differences in participants' mean task performance. In comparison, a model based on participants' responses to a self-report questionnaire was not predictive of such differences. Consequently, we suggest that visual behavior, as reflected in global gaze graph measures, is a strong predictor of individual performance differences. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of landmarks and individual differences in spatial navigation but also outline the potential of vision and gaze-graph-based spatial navigation research.",

    "title": "Mid-level visual features engage V4 to support sparse object recognition under uncertainty",
    "content": "Cortical visual prostheses have long promised to restore sight by directly stimulating the visual cortex, but current approaches remain limited. Conventional V1-targeted implants evoke isolated phosphenes that rarely support coherent object recognition, largely due to the sparse electrode arrays feasible for implantation. Here we examined whether mid-level features, specifically curve segments associated with area V4, provide a more efficient substrate for artificial vision. Using fMRI, 24 participants performed an object recognition task with stimuli fragmented into either phosphene-like dots or curve segments at graded densities. Behaviorally, curve segments enabled recognition at lower density thresholds than phosphenes, yielding steeper psychometric slopes and higher accuracy. Neuroimaging revealed that while both fragment types engaged V1, only curve segments recruited V4, and correct recognition of segments relative to phosphenes elicited widespread responses across temporal, parietal, and insular cortices. Mediation analyses further showed that recognition from phosphenes relied on anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) involvement with higher stimulus uncertainty, whereas segment-based recognition depended primarily on visual cortex. Together, these results demonstrate that mid-level feature fragments confer both perceptual and neural advantages over phosphenes, reducing reliance on downstream uncertainty resolution. V4 thus emerges as a promising target for next-generation cortical prostheses, offering a path toward sparser yet more informative stimulation strategies.",

    "title": "Ultrafast fMRI detects age-related changes in harmonics of cardiac pulsations in the brain at 7 T",
    "content": "Purpose: To develop and apply an ultra-fast fMRI acquisition at 7 T to measure the pulsatile signals in the brain with full brain coverage and detect age-related differences. Pulsatile signals' parameters provide information about the health status of the cerebrovascular system. This new acquisition provides a good mix of spatial coverage, image resolution, and temporal resolution for observing physiological signals. Methods: A partial separability MRI acquisition and reconstruction approach was used to collect 3D data acquired at 7 T with TR = 65 ms in 28 healthy adults. 8 young subjects and 14 older subjects (10 male and 12 female) had acceptable pulse plethysmography and MRI data. With full-brain coverage and 2 mm isotropic resolution, the reliability of the pulse signal (even/odd heartbeat as test/retest) within each brain voxel was computed across subjects. Within voxels of high pulse reliability, the average magnitude within 0.15 Hz of the 4 heartbeat harmonic frequencies were compared within CSF, GM, and WM between young/old and between male/female participants. Results: Increased first harmonic magnitude in older adults compared to young adults was detected in regions with reliable cardiac pulsations, which overlap major arteries and CSF pools. There was also a greater magnitude of the third harmonic normalized to the first in males. Brain maps of the pulse frequency and the harmonics were formed for visualization of regions of high pulsatility. Conclusion: This new approach captures the pulsatile signal with BOLD fMRI with high spatiotemporal resolution and can be sensitive to age- and sex-related differences.",

Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "title": "Universal differential equations as a unifying modeling language for neuroscience",
    "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",

    "content": "BackgroundAcute stress may disrupt decision - making by affecting cognitive and emotional processing. The behavioral and neural mechanisms of this in athletes are unclear. This study explored how acute stress impacts athletes\u2019 unfairness - related decision - making and its neural basis.MethodsForty participants (20 university athletes and 20 non-athletes) were randomly assigned to a stress group or a control group. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the study monitored the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) blood oxygenation during an ultimatum game task after inducing acute stress via the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST).ResultsAthletes under stress were more accepting of relatively unfair decisions than non-athletes. This was linked to lower activation in the frontal-eye areas (CH15), supramarginal gyrus (CH38), and somatosensory association cortex (CH67), and higher activation in the primary motor cortex (CH64) in athletes. The increase in acceptance efficiency correlated significantly with the reduced CH38 activation (r = \u22120.425) and increased CH64 activation (r = 0.499).ConclusionLong-term exercise training may promote athletes\u2019 tendency to accept relatively unfair decisions under acute stress by modulating activation levels in the supramarginal gyrus and primary motor cortex, demonstrating stronger adaptive behavior. These findings offer insights for developing stress management and neuromodulation training programs for athletes.",

    "title": "Differences in structural brain morphometry between musicians and non-musicians",
    "content": "ObjectiveAlthough music has been shown to affect brain function, the structural characteristics of the brain in musicians compared to non-musicians are often overlooked. This limited attention restricts the practical use of music\u2019s emotional, cognitive, and motor functions. The current study aimed to investigate structural differences in the brains of musicians compared to non-musicians in order to better understand the neuroanatomical basis of musical training.MethodsSixteen musicians and seventeen age-matched non-musicians underwent a brain structural neuroimaging scan. Group differences in structural morphometry were assessed.ResultsSignificant differences were found in cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth measures. Compared to non-musicians, musicians showed greater cortical thickness in the left superior frontal gyrus and right central parietal region, and showed structural advantages in fractal dimensionality and sulcal depth in the left fusiform gyrus and right central region. In contrast, non-musicians showed greater gyrification in the bilateral insula, right superior parietal lobule, and right supramarginal gyrus. Notably, significant interactive effects were observed between gender and cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth in regions of the limbic system, including the hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, insula, fusiform gyrus, and precuneus.ConclusionStructural differences in the frontal cortex, limbic system, and sensorimotor areas between musicians and non-musicians highlight the changes in brain structure associated with musical training. These findings provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of music-related brain function and may provide guidance for future applications of music to improve mental health and neuroplasticity.",

    "title": "Rising burden of subarachnoid hemorrhage linked to high systolic blood pressure among young and middle-aged populations: temporal trends and global implication",
    "content": "BackgroundSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular event that leads to high mortality and long-term disability, particularly among adults aged 25\u201349 years. Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the leading modifiable risk factor, yet its global burden in this age group has not been systematically assessed.MethodsWe analyzed population-level epidemiological data across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021 to estimate SAH mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to high SBP. Temporal trends were evaluated using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), and future trajectories to 2050 were projected with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.ResultsGlobally, SAH caused 24,908 deaths and 1,373,366 DALYs in 2021 due to high SBP in adults aged 25\u201349 years. Males had higher rates than females (mortality: 0.78 vs. 0.48 per 100,000; DALYs: 42.4 vs. 27.0 per 100,000), though females experienced steeper declines (EAPC_mortality: \u22121.78%). The highest burden was in the 45\u201349 age group (deaths: 9,768; DALYs: 474,092). From 1990 to 2021, high-SDI regions achieved the greatest reductions in mortality (\u221250.3%) and DALYs (\u221246.8%), while low-SDI regions saw increases in deaths (+109.5%) and DALYs (+114.7%). Nationally, Zimbabwe and Guatemala showed the sharpest increases in mortality (EAPC: +4.71% and +3.76%), while Sweden and Swiss Confederation achieved the greatest declines (EAPC: \u22125.5% and \u22124.9%). Forecasts suggest continued global declines by 2050, but widening disparities by sex, age, and socio-demographic status.ConclusionAlthough the global burden of SAH attributable to high SBP is decreasing, young and middle-aged adults-especially males and those in low-SDI regions-continue to face substantial risks. Targeted hypertension control and region-specific prevention strategies are urgently needed.",

    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

    "title": "Deep learning in intracranial EEG for seizure detection: advances, challenges, and clinical applications",
    "content": "Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the automated detection and classification of seizure events from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. In this review, we synthesize recent advancements in deep learning techniques including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) units, and transformer based architectures that enable accurate localization of epileptogenic zones (EZ) in drug resistant epilepsy. These approaches effectively extract spatial and temporal features from raw iEEG signals to detect epileptiform discharges (ED) including seizures alongside other electro-physiological biomarkers such as high-frequency oscillations (HFO). Importantly, beyond relying solely on these traditional markers, several studies have indicated direct seizure detection by modeling ictal and preictal dynamics. Such methods capture alternative biomarkers including spectral changes, connectivity patterns, and complex temporal signatures that directly reflect seizure activity. Although deep learning models often achieve high accuracy, they continue to face several challenges due to data scarcity, heterogeneity in iEEG acquisition, inconsistent preprocessing protocols, and limited model interpretability. We also highlight emerging integrative strategies that combine multimodal neuroimaging data with deep learning analyses as well as neuromorphic computing techniques designed for real-time clinical application. Addressing these limitations has significant potential for surgical planning, reducing diagnostic subjectivity, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in epilepsy care.",

    "content": "BackgroundOptimizing radiation dose to protect white matter (WM) tracts during stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) necessitates the integration of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based WM tractography to delineate WM tracts and establish dose constraints. Conventional manual delineation of perilesional targets demonstrated significant operational inefficiency, primarily attributed to the complex structural interdigitation between pathological vasculature and eloquent brain areas.PurposeThis study aimed to develop a two-stage deep learning (DL) method that combines a two-dimensional (2D) U-Net detection-aided and three-dimensional (3D) self-attention segmentation model for automatic bAVM segmentation. This method focuses on improving efficiency in clinical practice while protecting WM tracts using multimodal imaging and WM tractography in SRS.MethodsWe analyzed imaging data from 191 patients who underwent CyberKnife-based SRS at Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, with bAVMs closely adjacent to WM tracts. A total of 153 patients were used to construct a two-stage DL model to segment the bAVMs on multimodal imaging and WM tractography, while the remaining 38 patients were utilized to validate the model's performance. We introduced spatial and channel attention modules in the U-Net variant, along with a versatile \u201cAttentional ResBlock,\u201d achieving parameter efficiency through cross-dimensional interaction while preserving model fidelity. The accuracy of the auto-segmented contours is evaluated using geometric indices and dosimetric endpoints.ResultsOur proposed model demonstrated superior segmentation performance, achieving a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.84 \u00b1 0.05, sensitivity of 0.92 \u00b1 0.09, and F2-score of 0.79 \u00b1 0.08. Furthermore, it attained a low Hausdorff distance (4.55 \u00b1 1.14 mm) and mean surface distance (0.53 \u00b1 0.08 mm), indicating exceptional boundary delineation precision. The difference in the proportion of WM tracts within the target region between manual and our automated contours is minimal (0.08 \u00b1 0.13). Meanwhile, strong concordance is observed between auto-segmented and manually contoured targets across the majority of dosimetric endpoints, with a mean difference of 0.46 Gy. The received dose of WM tracts in the two comparison plans also has an acceptable representation of dosimetric parameters (R2 = 0.92 for Dmean and 0.88 for V1Gy). Dose exposition of the organ at risk (OAR) shows no statistically significant differences in treatment plans with auto-segmentation targets compared to regular plans.ConclusionThe reliable bAVM automated-segmentation method has been validated and may support SRS planning for bAVMs and thus avoid neurological sequelae after SRS in considering WM tracts protection.",

    "content": "Autism spectrum disorder is a neurological and developmental condition known to impact a person's learning, communication, and interpersonal interactions. Recent research has highlighted the role of nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) in neurodevelopment and synaptic function, suggesting their potential involvement in ASD pathophysiology. NHRs regulate gene expression that are critical for neural differentiation, plasticity, and metabolic processes. Dysregulation of these receptors can lead to altered neural circuit formation and neurotransmitter imbalances, which are commonly observed in ASD. Understanding the interplay between NHRs and ASD could open new avenues for therapeutic interventions, providing hope for more personalized approaches to managing the disorder. One key receptor is retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-alpha (RORA), which was shown to be reduced in individuals with ASD. Among its numerous functions during development, RORA was shown to regulate the transcription of genes involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptic function, and neuroprotection. Studies have identified that RORA expression is reduced in individuals with ASD, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, affecting transcription of multiple ASD-associated genes. In the present review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms leading to ASD pathophysiology, various treatment modalities, the prospects of the RORA gene therapy approach, and future perspectives.",

    "title": "Optimizing real-time phase detection in diverse rhythmic biological signals for phase-specific neurostimulation",
    "content": "Objective. Closed-loop, phase-specific neurostimulation is a powerful method to modulate ongoing brain activity for clinical and research applications. Phase-specific stimulation relies on estimating the phase of an ongoing oscillation in real time and issuing a control command at a target phase. Phase detection algorithms based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are widely used due to their computational efficiency and robustness. However, it is unclear how algorithm performance depends on the spectral properties of the input signal and how algorithm parameters can be optimized. Approach. We evaluated the in silico performance of three phase detection algorithms [Endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT), Hilbert transform (HT), and phase mapping (PM)] on three real-world biological signals with distinct spectral properties (theta oscillations from rodent hippocampal local field potential, alpha oscillations from human electroencephalogram (EEG), and hand movement kinematics from essential tremor patients) to identify the optimal model and parameters. We then validated the performance of an algorithm for estimating theta phase in real-time using rats implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus. Results. First, we found that signal amplitude and frequency variations strongly influence algorithm performance. Frequency-specific signal-to-noise ratio was positively correlated with performance (mean R2 = 0.42 across metrics), while amplitude and frequency variability were negatively correlated (mean R2 = 0.50 across metrics). Second, we showed that the length of the data window used for phase estimation is the key parameter for optimal performance of FFT-based algorithms, where the optimal data window length corresponds to the period of the oscillation (\u223c150 ms for hippocampal theta oscillations, \u223c100 ms for human EEG alpha, and \u223c125 ms for essential tremor kinematics). We validated this finding in vivo by estimating the phase of theta oscillations from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, where a data window length corresponding to one theta cycle yielded the best performance across all metrics compared with shorter or longer window lengths. Significance. Our findings clarify the relationship between signal properties and algorithm performance and provide a convenient method for optimizing FFT-based phase detection algorithms. We show that a data window length corresponding to one cycle of an oscillation can lead to improved performance.",

    "content": "This paper presents tilt-and-pivot manipulation, a robotic technique for picking large, thin objects resting on hard supporting surfaces. The method employs in-hand dexterous manipulation by reorienting the gripper around the object's contact point, allowing a finger to enter the gap between the object and the surface, without requiring relative sliding at the contact. This finally facilitates reliable pinch grasps on the object's faces. We investigate the kinematic principles and planning...",

The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "title": "The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test for adults: A refined version in Spanish.",
    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Whats our purpose? <em>Whats the point?</em></p>\n<p>For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth.</p>\n<p>As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress.</p>\n<p>I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings. However I believe its important that we each learn to <em><strong>harness that energy into things that are positive and kind</strong></em>, not negative or evil.</p>\n<p>Remember that a lot of who you are, is your ability to experience things outside of yourself, <em>including other humans.</em> They are a direct and immediate part of your own reality. Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved. As frustrating as the world can be, it is worth protecting, it is worth loving, it is worth healing together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish...

Think of all the power that's in the universe, moving the earth, growing the trees. That's the same power within you if you only have the courage and the will to use it.&quot;</em> - Charlie Chaplin, Limelight 1952</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone.&quot;</em> - Isa Upanishad</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "title": "Pylint 4 changes what's considered a constant. Does a use case exist?",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Pylint 4 changed their definition of constants. Previously, all variables at the root of a module were considered constants and expected to be in all caps. With Pylint 4, they are now checking to see if a variable is reassigned non-exclusively. If it is, then it's treated as a &quot;module-level variable&quot; and expected to be in snake case.</p> <p>So this pattern, which used to be valid, now raises an invalid-name warning.</p> <pre><code>SERIES_STD = ' \u258c\u2588' if platform.system() == 'Windows' else ' \u258f\u258e\u258d\u258c\u258b\u258a\u2589\u2588' try: SERIES_STD.encode(sys.__stdout__.encoding) except UnicodeEncodeError: SERIES_STD = ' |' except (AttributeError, TypeError): pass </code></pre> <p>This could be re-written to match the new definition of a constant, but doing so reduces readability.</p> <p>In my mind any runtime code is placed in classes, function or guarded with a dunder name clause. This only leaves code needed for module initialization. Within that, I see two categories of variables at the module root, constants and globals.</p> <ul> <li>Constants <ul> <li>After value is determine (like above example), it never changes</li> <li>All caps</li> </ul></li> <li>Globals <ul> <li>After the value is determined, it can be changed within a function/method via the global keyword</li> <li>snake case, but should also start with an underscore or <code>__all__</code> should be defined and exclude them (per <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#global-variable-names\">PEP8</a>)</li> <li>rare, Pylint complains when the global keyword is used</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Pylint 4 uses the following categories</p> <ul> <li>Constants <ul> <li>Value is assigned once, exclusively</li> <li>All caps</li> </ul></li> <li>Module-level variables <ul> <li>Any variable that is assigned more than once, non-exclusively</li> <li>snake case</li> <li>Includes globals as defined above</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>A big distinction here is I do not think exclusive assignment should make a difference because it means the pattern of (assign, test, fallback) is invalid for a constant. I treat both assignment statements in the above example as part of determining the value of the constant.</p> <p>I have been unable to see a real case where you'd change the value of a variable at the module root after it's initial value is determined and not violate some other good coding practice.</p> <p>I've been looking for 4 days and haven't found any good examples that benefit from the new behavior in Pylint 4. Every example seems to have something scary in it, like parsing a config file as part of module initialization, and, once refactored to follow other good practices, the reassignment of module-level variables disappears.</p> <p>Does someone have an example?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/avylove\"> /u/avylove </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oj4mcr/pylint_4_changes_whats_considered_a_constant_does/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oj4mcr/pylint_4_changes_whats_considered_a_constant_does/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
    "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

    "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "content": "Recent computational, pre-clinical, and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential for using neuromodulation through simultaneous targeting of multiple deep brain regions. This approach has already been used for therapeutic and systems neuroscience applications. However, the broad clinical adoption of invasive distributed deep brain interfaces remains in its early stages. This review explores the barriers to implementation by addressing three key questions: do the benefits of implanting multiple electrodes justify the associated risks for specific applications? What is the risk-benefit ratio, and what technological advancements will be necessary to encourage clinical adoption? We also examine next-generation technologies that could enable multi-target brain interfaces, including system-on-chip micro-stimulators as well as nanoparticles. We highlight the role of novel machine learning algorithms in the optimization of stimulation parameters and for the guidance of device placement. Emerging hardware accelerators equipped with on-chip AI have demonstrated functionality that can be used to decode and to classify distributed neuronal data. This advance in hardware accelerators has also contributed to the potential for enhanced closed-loop stimulation control of devices. Despite these advances, significant technological and translational barriers persist, limiting the widespread clinical application of multi-target brain interfaces. This review provides a critical analysis of recent prototypes and novel hardware for use in multi-target systems. We will discuss both clinical and research applications. We will focus on the utilization of multi-site technologies to meet the needs of neurological diseases. We conclude that there exists a critical need for further innovation and integration of multi-site technologies into clinical practice.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility.

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks).

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "title": "Leveraging hand-crafted radiomics on multicenter FLAIR MRI for predicting disability worsening in people with multiple sclerosis",
    "content": "BackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, leading to varying degrees of functional impairment. Conventional tools, such as the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), lack sensitivity to subtle disease worsening. Radiomics provides a quantitative imaging approach to address this limitation. This study applied machine learning (ML) and radiomics features from T2-weighted Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict disability worsening in MS.MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on real-world data from 247 PwMS across two centers. Disability worsening was defined as a change in EDSS over two years. FLAIR MRIs underwent preprocessing and super-resolution reconstruction to enhance low-resolution images. White matter lesions (WML) were segmented using the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox (LST), and tissue segmentation was performed using sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation. Radiomics features from WML and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were extracted using Pyradiomics, harmonized with Longitudinal ComBat, followed by recursive feature elimination for feature selection. Elastic Net, Balanced Random Forest (BRFC), and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) models were trained and evaluated.ResultsThe LGBM model with harmonized radiomics and clinical features outperformed the clinical-only model, achieving a test area under the precision-recall curve (PR AUC) of 0.20 and a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of 0.64. Key predictive features, among others, included Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) maximum probability (WML) and Gray-Level Dependence Matrix (GLDM) dependence non-uniformity (NAWM). However, short-term longitudinal changes showed limited predictive power (PR AUC = 0.11, ROC AUC = 0.69).ConclusionThese findings highlight the potential of ML-driven radiomics in predicting disability worsening, warranting validation in larger, balanced datasets and exploration of advanced deep learning approaches.",

    "content": "Objective. Spike sorting, which involves detecting and attributing spikes to their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, is a common process in electrophysiology and brain\u2013computer interface systems. Recent advances in large-scale neural recording technologies are challenging the conventional algorithms because of the intensive computational workloads required and the accuracy degradation suffered from time-variant spike patterns and significant levels of noise. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated promising performance in processing these large-scale neural recordings. However, their applications are constrained by the labor-intensive data labeling and the lack of fully vectorized frameworks with end-to-end NNs. Approach. We propose E-Sort, an end-to-end NN-based spike sorter with transfer learning and parallelizable post-processing to address both obstacles. Main results. We examined our framework in both synthetic and real datasets. The results of the processing of the synthetic datasets show that our approach can reduce the number of annotated spikes required for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.7% higher accuracy. We evaluated E-Sort on various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift patterns, which demonstrates that our design can achieve an accuracy that is comparable with Kilosort4 while sorting 50\u2009s of data in only 1.32\u2009s. To test with real datasets, we first sorted the spikes using Kilosort4 and used the sorted spikes at the initial period to pre-train the NN; then we compared and measured the agreement between the results from the trained model and those from Kilosort4. On average the pre-training process improved the result agreement by 30% approximately. Significance. E-Sort offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate NN-based framework for large-scale spike sorting, significantly reducing manual labeling effort and processing time.",

    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

We used machine learning to analyze thematic differences between unemployed individuals and a control group. The results revealed that the dreams of unemployed individuals demonstrated an underrepresentation of surprise and visual observations alongside an overrepresentation of work-related topics. These patterns suggest that unemployment is associated with distinct alterations in dream content, reflecting reduced cognitive engagement and heightened preoccupation with occupational concerns. This study establishes the feasibility of leveraging large-scale, publicly available data to explore the dream content of subpopulations.

This article examines this possibility by providing an overview of the theoretical rationale for their relationship and a preliminary empirical study exploring the relationships between a brief measure of fragmentation proneness, distress, and nightmares among 307 undergraduate students. The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares. The results and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">First, I guess I should've avoided the word \"rhetorical.\" &nbsp;In my post, I characterized Ioannidis's 2005 claim, type M and S errors, and multiverse analysis as \"rhetorical tools\" that have been been useful in the field of science criticism but which I would not use in my own analyses. &nbsp;I could've added to this many other statistical methods including p-values and Bayes factors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One very obvious way to see that I never thought Type M and Type S errors \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis'\" is that, since the appearance of that article in 2014, I've published dozens of applied papers, and in only very few of these did I look at Type M and Type S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

To date, the performance of the trim and fill\nmethod has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more\ncomprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in\na number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those\nfrom usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely\nuse of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in\nthe meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the\nperformance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study\nheterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive\neffect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is\npresent the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than\nthe usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate\nfrom the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the\npresence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our\nsimulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the\npresence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce\nthe bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not\nideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly\ncaused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the\nperformance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various\nmeta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form\nof sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.2889&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n17476644&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;4544-4562&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Performance\nof the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and\nbetween-study\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Peters&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jaime\nL.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Sutton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Alex\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;David\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Abrams&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Keith\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Rushton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lesley&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2007&quot;,11,10]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/DMQP989N&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;It\nis known that the existence of publication bias can influence the conclusions\nof a meta-analysis. Some methods have been developed to deal with publication\nbias, but issues remain. One particular method called 'trim and fill' is\ndesigned to adjust for publication bias. The method, which is intuitively\nappealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a simple and\npopular graphical tool called the funnel plot. We present a simulation study\ndesigned to evaluate the behaviour of this method. Our results indicate that\nwhen the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they estimate different\neffects), trim and fill may inappropriately adjust for publication bias where\nnone exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously adjust for non-existent\nbias if (i) the variability among studies causes some precisely estimated\nstudies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii) an inverse\nrelationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is introduced by the\nstudies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest that the funnel plot\nitself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses. Selection modelling is\nan alternative method warranting further study. It performed better than trim\nand fill in our simulations, although its frequency of convergence varied,\ndepending on the simulation parameters.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.1461&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n12820277&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;2113-2126&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Adjusting\nfor publication bias in the presence of\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Terrin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Norma&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schmid&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Christopher\nH.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lau&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joseph&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Olkin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ingram&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2003&quot;,7,15]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Peters\net al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

Specifying a\nrange of values around zero allows researchers to statistically reject the\npresence of effects large enough to matter, and prevents practically\ninsignificant effects from being interpreted as a statistically significant\ndifference. We compare the behavior of the recently proposed second generation\np-value (Blume, D\u2019Agostino McGowan, Dupont, &amp; Greevy, 2018) with the more\nestablished Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) equivalence testing procedure\n(Schuirmann, 1987). We show that the two approaches yield almost identical\nresults under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g., when the\nconfidence interval is wider than the equivalence range, or when confidence\nintervals are asymmetric) the second generation p-value becomes difficult to\ninterpret. The second generation p-value is interpretable in a dichotomous\nmanner (i.e., when the SGPV equals 0 or 1 because the confidence intervals lies\ncompletely within or outside of the equivalence range), but this dichotomous\ninterpretation does not require calculations. We conclude that equivalence\ntests yield more consistent p-values, distinguish between datasets that yield\nthe same second generation p-value, and allow for easier control of Type I and\nType II error rates.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.933&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Daniel Lakens, Marie Delacre&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;1-11&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Equivalence\nTesting and the Second Generation\nP-Value&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Delacre&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marie&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,7,13]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lakens\n&amp; Delacre, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

We then\npropose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the\nreplication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The\nreplication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we\ncould gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a)\nthe value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim\nbased on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal\ndecision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph\nmodeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of\nexpected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative\nestimates of replication value.

We\ntested our strategy on a sample of fMRI studies in social neuroscience. We\nfirst report our efforts to generate a representative candidate set of\nreplication targets. We then explore the feasibility and reliability of\nestimating replication value for the targets in our set, resulting in a dataset\nof 1358 studies ranked on their value of prioritising them for replication. In\naddition, we carefully examine possible measures, test auxiliary assumptions,\nand identify boundary conditions of measuring value and uncertainty. We end our\nreport by discussing how future validation studies might be designed. Our study\ndemonstrates the importance of investigating how to implement study selection\nstrategies in practice.

Methodologists have proposed a variety\nof statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is\nnot clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here,\nwe present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of\nthe most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might\nrealistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several\nlevels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity,\nand used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature.

We give exact theoretical results showing\nhow selection for significance affects the distribution of statistical power in\na heterogeneous population of significance tests.

The p-uniform\nand p-curve methods performed well with a fixed effects size and varying sample\nsizes. However, when there was substantial variability in effect sizes as well\nas sample sizes, both methods systematically overestimate mean power. With\nheterogeneity in effect sizes, the maximum likelihood model produced the most\naccurate estimates when the distribution of effect sizes matched the\nassumptions of the model, but z-curve produced more accurate estimates when the\nassumptions of the maximum likelihood model were not met.

The properties of\np-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of\nthese simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be\nused as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a\ncertain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually\ndemonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous\nmathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined\nwithout simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any\nstatistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough\nevaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions\np-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition,\nwe used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of\npublication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence\nthe shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than\n1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also\nsuggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an\narticle as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level.\nThis gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of\nreal effects even when no such effects are actually present.

What is fair to say is that\nstatisticians failed to engage with an incredibly important topic (test for\npublication bias) that addressed a clear need in many scientific communities,\nas most of the criticism was by psychological methodologists. I fully agree\nthat statisticians should have engaged more with this technique. I believe the\nreason that they didn\u2019t is because there is a real problem in the reward\nstructure in statistics, where statisticians get greater rewards inside their\nfield by proposing a 12<sup>th</sup> approach to compute confidence intervals\naround a non-parametric effect size estimate for a test that no one uses, than\nto help psychologists solve a problem they really need a solution for. Indeed,\nfor a statistician, publication bias is a very messy business, and there will\nnever be a sufficiently rigorous test for publication bias to get credit from\nfellow statisticians. There are no beautiful mathematical solutions, no\ncreative insights, there is only the messy reality of a literature that is\nbiased by human actions that we can never adequately capture in a model. The\nfact that empirical researchers often don\u2019t know where to begin to evaluate the\nreliability of claims in their publication-bias-ridden field is not something\nstatisticians care about.

Scrutiny is important, but we can\u2019t know how extensively methods\nshould be vetted, we don\u2019t know how to identify experts, everyone \u2013 including \u2018experts\u2019\n\u2013 is fallible. It is na\u00efve to think \u2018expert vetting\u2019 will lead to clear answers\nabout the methods we should use, and should not use. If we can\u2019t even reach\nagreement about the use of p-values, no one should believe we will ever reach\nagreement about the use of methods to detect publication bias, which will\nalways be messy at best. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I like my\nscience free from authority arguments. Everyone should do their best to\ncriticize everyone else, and if they are able, themselves. Some people will be\nin a better position to criticize some papers than others, but it is difficult\nto predict where the most fatal criticism will come from. Treating statistics\npapers published in a statistics journal as superior to papers in a psychology\njournal is too messy to be a good idea, and boil down to a form of elitism that\nI can\u2019t condone. Sometimes even a lowly 20% statistician can point out flaws in\nmethods proposed by card-carrying statisticians. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">What we can\ndo better is implementing actual quality control.

Morey and Davis-Stober point out the limitations of simulation-based\ntests of a method and convincingly argue for the value of evaluating the\nmathematical properties of a testing procedure. If as a field we agree that an\nevaluation of the mathematical properties of a test is desirable, we should\ntrack whether this evaluation has been performed, or not. We could have a long\nchecklist of desirable quality control standards \u2013 e.g., a method has been\ntested on real datasets, it has been compared to similar methods, those\ncomparisons have been performed objectively based on a well-justified set of\ncriteria, etc. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One could\ncreate a database where for each method the quality standards that have been\nmet and that have not been met are listed. If considered useful, the database\ncould also track how often a method is used, by tracking citations, and listing\npapers that have implemented the method (as opposed to those merely discussing\nthe method). When statistical methods become widely used, the database would point\nresearchers to which methods deserve more scrutiny. The case of magnitude-based\ninference in sport science reveals the importance of a public call for scrutiny\nwhen a method becomes widely popular, especially when this popularity is\nlimited to a single field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The more\ncomplex methods are, the more limitations they have. This will be true for all\nmethods that aim to deal with publication bias, because the way scientists bias\nthe literature is difficult to quantify. Maybe as a field we will come to agree\nthat tests for bias are never accurate enough, and we will recommend people to\njust look at the distribution of p-values without performing a test. Alternatively,\nwe might believe that it is useful to have a testing procedure that too often\nsuggests a literature contains at least some non-zero effects, because we feel\nwe need some way to intersubjectively point out that there is bias in a\nliterature, even if this is based on an imperfect test. Such discussions\nrequire a wide range of stakeholders, and the opinion of statisticians about\nthe statistical properties of a test is only one source of input in this\ndiscussion. Imperfect procedures are implemented all the time, if they are the\nbest we have, and doing nothing is also not working. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Statistical\nmethods are rarely perfect from their inception, and all have limitations. Although\nI understand the feeling, banning all tests that have not been adequately vetted\nby an expert is inherently unscientific. Such a suggestion would destroy the\nvery core of science \u2013 an institution that promotes mutual criticism, while\naccepting our fallibility.

    "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.25656v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visualizing changes over time is fundamental to learning from the past and anticipating the future. However, temporal semantics can be complicated, and existing visualization tools often struggle to accurately represent these complexities. It is common to use bespoke plot helper functions designed to produce specific graphics, due to the absence of flexible general tools that respect temporal semantics. We address this problem by proposing a grammar of temporal graphics, and an associated software implementation, 'ggtime', that encodes temporal semantics into a declarative grammar for visualizing temporal data. The grammar introduces new composable elements that support visualization across linear, cyclical, quasi-cyclical, and other granularities; standardization of irregular durations; and alignment of time points across different granularities and time zones. It is designed for interoperability with other semantic variables, allowing navigation across the space of visualizations while preserving temporal semantics.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.25593v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The growing adoption of electric vehicles, known for their quieter operation compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, raises concerns about their detectability, particularly for vulnerable road users. To address this, regulations mandate the inclusion of exterior sound signals for electric vehicles, specifying minimum sound pressure levels at low speeds. These synthetic exterior sounds are often used in noisy urban environments, creating the challenge of enhancing detectability without introducing excessive noise annoyance. This study investigates the design of synthetic exterior sound signals that balance high noticeability with low annoyance. An audiovisual experiment with 14 participants was conducted using 15 virtual reality scenarios featuring a passing car. The scenarios included various sound signals, such as pure, intermittent, and complex tones at different frequencies. Two baseline cases, a diesel engine and only tyre noise, were also tested. Participants rated sounds for annoyance, noticeability, and informativeness using 11-point ICBEN scales. The findings highlight how psychoacoustic sound quality metrics predict annoyance ratings better than conventional sound metrics, providing insight into optimising sound design for electric vehicles. By improving pedestrian safety while minimising noise pollution, this research supports the development of effective and user-friendly exterior sound standards for electric vehicles.",

This paper presents findings from a test-track study with 40 participants in a real-world rural automated driving scenario. In this scenario, a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent (CA) was designed to check in with drivers and re-engage them with their surroundings. Drawing on in-car video recordings, sleepiness ratings and interviews, we analysed how drivers interacted with the agent and how these interactions shaped alertness. Users found the CA helpful for supporting vigilance during passive fatigue. Thematic analysis of acceptability further revealed three user preference profiles that implicate future intention to use CAs. Positioning empirically observed profiles within existing CA archetype frameworks highlights the need for adaptive design sensitive to diverse user groups. This work underscores the potential of CAs as proactive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) interventions, demonstrating how natural language can support context-aware interaction during automated driving.",

While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has transformed diabetes care, its potential for supporting sub-health populations -- such as individuals who are overweight, prediabetic, or anxious -- remains underexplored. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in health coaching, yet CGM is rarely incorporated as a first-class signal. To address this gap, we conducted a six-week autoethnography, combining CGM with multimodal indicators captured via common digital devices and a chatbot that offered personalized reflections and explanations of glucose fluctuations. Our findings show how CGM-led, data-first multimodal tracking, coupled with conversational support, shaped everyday practices of diet, activity, stress, and wellbeing. This work contributes to HCI by extending CGM research beyond clinical diabetes and demonstrating how LLM-driven agents can support preventive health and reflection in at-risk populations.",

This study experimentally tested whether short-term exposure to narrow AI tools enhances core cognitive abilities or simply optimizes task performance. Thirty young adults completed standardized neuropsychological assessments embedded in a seven-week protocol with a four-week online intervention involving problem-solving and verbal comprehension tasks, either with or without AI support (ChatGPT). While AI-assisted participants completed several tasks faster and more accurately, no significant pre-post differences emerged in standardized measures of problem solving or verbal comprehension. These results demonstrate efficiency gains without cognitive change, suggesting that current narrow AI systems serve as cognitive scaffolds extending performance without transforming underlying mental capacities. The findings highlight the need for ethical and educational frameworks that promote critical and autonomous thinking in an increasingly AI-augmented cognitive ecology.",

This paper introduces Contextual and Cultural Intelligence (CCI) -- a systematic framework enabling AI systems to process cultural meaning, not just data patterns, through locally relevant, emotionally intelligent, and economically inclusive design. Using design science methodology, we validate CCI through a production AI-native cross-border shopping platform serving diaspora communities. Key empirical findings: 89% of users prefer WhatsApp-based AI interaction over traditional web interfaces (n=602, chi-square=365.8, p<0.001), achieving 536 WhatsApp users and 3,938 total conversations across 602 unique users in just 6 weeks, and culturally informed prompt engineering demonstrates sophisticated understanding of culturally contextualized queries, with 89% family-focused commerce patterns and natural code-switching acceptance. The CCI framework operationalizes three technical pillars: Infrastructure Intelligence (mobile-first, resilient architectures), Cultural Intelligence (multilingual NLP with social context awareness), and Commercial Intelligence (trust-based conversational commerce). This work contributes both theoretical innovation and reproducible implementation patterns, challenging Silicon Valley design orthodoxies while providing actionable frameworks for equitable AI deployment across resource-constrained markets.",

AmarDoctor adopts a data-driven approach to strengthen primary care delivery and enable personalized health management. While platforms such as AdaHealth, WebMD, Symptomate, and K-Health have become popular in recent years, they mainly serve European demographics and languages. AmarDoctor addresses this gap with a dual-interface system for both patients and healthcare providers, supporting three major Bengali dialects. At its core, the patient module uses an adaptive questioning algorithm to assess symptoms and guide users toward the appropriate specialist. To overcome digital literacy barriers, it integrates a voice-interactive AI assistant that navigates users through the app services. Complementing this, the clinician-facing interface incorporates AI-powered decision support that enhances workflow efficiency by generating structured provisional diagnoses and treatment recommendations. These outputs inform key services such as e-prescriptions, video consultations, and medical record management. To validate clinical accuracy, the system was evaluated against a gold-standard set of 185 clinical vignettes developed by experienced physicians. Effectiveness was further assessed by comparing AmarDoctor performance with five independent physicians using the same vignette set. Results showed AmarDoctor achieved a top-1 diagnostic precision of 81.08 percent (versus physicians average of 50.27 percent) and a top specialty recommendation precision of 91.35 percent (versus physicians average of 62.6 percent).",

Results show that (i) stimulus cues strongly enhance perceived-emotion predictions (macro F1 up to 0.77), while (ii) personality traits provide the largest improvements for felt emotion recognition (macro F1 up to 0.58). These findings highlight the benefit of combining physiological, trait-level, and contextual information to address the inherent subjectivity of emotion. By distinguishing between perceived and felt responses, our approach advances multimodal affective computing and points toward more personalized and ecologically valid emotion-aware systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2504.13727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.23391v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: A critical visual computation is to construct global scene properties from activities of early visual cortical neurons which have small receptive fields. Such a computation is enabled by contextual influences, through which a neuron's response to visual inputs is influenced by contextual inputs outside its classical receptive fields. Accordingly, neurons can signal global properties including visual saliencies and figure-ground relationships. Many believe that intracortical axons conduct signals too slowly to bring the contextual information from receptive fields of other neurons. A popular opinion is that much of the contextual influences arise from feedback from higher visual areas whose neurons have larger receptive fields. This paper re-examines pre-existing data to reveal these unexpected findings: the conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons increases approximately linearly with the conduction distance, and is sufficiently high for conveying the contextual influences. Recognizing the importance of intracortical contribution to critical visual computations should enable fresh progress in answering long-standing questions.",

We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5).

A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness. Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle, pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",

We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain.",

    "title": "How can methods for classifying and clustering trajectories be used for prevention trials? An example in Alzheimer's disease area",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.24751v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Background: Clinical trials are designed to prove the efficacy of an intervention by means of model-based approaches involving parametric hypothesis testing. Issues arise when no effect is observed in the study population. Indeed, an effect may be present in a subgroup and the statistical test cannot detect it. To investigate this possibility, we proposed to change the paradigm to a data-driven approach. We selected exploratory methods to provide another perspective on the data and to identify particular homogeneous subgroups of subjects within which an effect might be detected. In the setting of prevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures. In the settings of prevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures, which requires the use of methods that can take data autocorrelation into account. The primary aim of this work was to explore the applicability of different methods for clustering and classifying trajectories. Methods: The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) was a three-year randomized controlled trial with four parallel arms (NCT00672685). The primary outcome was a composite Z-score combining four cognitive tests. The data were analyzed by quadratic mixed effects model. This study was inconclusive. Exploratory analysis is therefore relevant to investigate the use of data-driven methods for trajectory classification. The methods used were unsupervised: k-means for longitudinal data, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), graphic semiology, and supervised analysis with dichotomous classification according to responder status. Results: Using k-means for longitudinal data, three groups were obtained and one of these groups showed cognitive decline over the three years of follow-up. This method could be applied directly to the primary outcome, the composite Z-score with repeated observations over time. With the two others unsupervised methods, we were unable to process longitudinal data directly. It was therefore necessary to choose an indicator of change in trajectories and to consider the rate of change between two measurements. For the HCA method, Ward's aggregation was performed. The Euclidean distance and rates of change were applied for the graphic semiology method. Lastly, as there were no objective criteria to define responder status, we defined our responders based on clinical criteria. Discussion: In the princeps study, the prevention trial was found to be inconclusive, likely due to the heterogeneity of the population, which may have masked a treatment effect later identified in a refined subgroup of high Beta Amyloid subjects. So, we have adopted an alternative unsupervised approach to subject stratification based on their trajectories. We could then identify patterns of similar trajectories of cognitive decline and also highlight the potential problem of a large heterogeneity of the profiles, maybe due to the final endpoint considered.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.24733v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work. A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.25119v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: It is known that listeners lose the ability to discriminate the direction of motion of a revolving sound (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) beyond a critical velocity (\"the upper limit\"), primarily due to degraded front-back discrimination. Little is known about how this ability is affected by simultaneously present distractor sounds, despite the real-life importance of tracking moving sounds in the presence of distractors. We hypothesized that the presence of a static distractor sound would impair the perception of moving target sounds and reduce the upper limit, and show that this is indeed the case. A distractor on the right was as effective as a distractor at the front in reducing the upper limit despite the importance of resolving front-back confusions. By manipulating the spectral content of both the target and distractor, we found that the upper limit was reduced if and only if the distractor spectrally overlaps with the target in the frequency range relevant for front/back discrimination; energetic masking thus explains the upper limit reduction by the distractor. We did not find any evidence for informational masking by the distractor. Our findings form the first steps towards a better understanding of the tracking of multiple sounds in the presence of distractors.",

Building upon previous works, where a field approach to activity--connectivity dynamics, formation of collective states and effective fields of collective states were successively introduced, the present paper synthesizes and extends these results toward a general description of multiple hierarchical collective structures. Starting with the dynamical system representing collective states in terms of connections, activity levels, and internal frequencies, we analyze its stability, emphasizing the possibility of transitions between configurations. Then, turning to the field formalism of collective states, we extend this framework to include substructures (subobjects) participating in larger assemblies while retaining intrinsic properties. We define activation classes describing compatible or independent activity patterns between objects and subobjects, and study stability conditions arising from their alignment or mismatch. The global system is described as the collection of landscapes of coexisting and interacting collective states, each characterized both by continuous (activity, frequency) and discrete (class) variables. A corresponding field formalism is developed, with an action functional incorporating both internal dynamics and interaction terms. This nonlinear field model captures cascading transitions between collective states and the formation of composite structures, providing a coherent theoretical basis for emergent neuronal assemblies and their mutual couplings.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.24741v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have the potential to provide new insights into psychiatric disorders. Here we create a DRL model of schizophrenia: a complex psychotic disorder characterized by anhedonia, avoidance, temporal discounting, catatonia, and hallucinations. Schizophrenia's causes are not well understood: dopaminergic theories emphasize dopamine system dysfunction, while neurodevelopmental theories emphasize abnormal connectivity, including excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance in the brain. In this study, we suppressed positive (excitatory) connections within an artificial neural network to simulate E/I imbalance. Interestingly, this is insufficient to create behavioral changes; the network simply compensates for the imbalance. But in doing so it becomes more sensitive to noise. Injecting noise into the network then creates a range of schizophrenic-like behaviours. These findings point to an interesting potential pathology of schizophrenia: E/I imbalance leads to a compensatory response by the network to increase the excitability of neurons, which increases susceptibility to noise. This suggests that the combination of E/I imbalance and neural noise may be key in the emergence of schizophrenic symptoms. We further notice altered response to reward prediction error in our model, and thus propose that E/I imbalance plus noise can account for both schizophrenia symptoms and dopamine system dysfunction: potentially unifying dopaminergic and neurodevelopmental theories of schizophrenia pathology.",

    "title": "Non-invasive prediction of conduction velocities in the human brain from MRI-derived microstructure features at 7 Tesla",
    "content": "The conduction velocity of neuronal signals along axons is a key neurophysiological property that can be altered in various disease processes. While cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) can be measured in presurgical assessment to provide information about conduction delay between a subset of brain regions, it is currently not possible to efficiently and systematically estimate conduction velocity in vivo across the whole brain. Given the established link between conduction velocity and axon morphology (most notably axon diameter but also myelination), mapping a reliable and quantitative metric linked to axon properties could fill the gap of inferring conduction velocity across the entire human brain. By integrating multiple MRI-derived microstructural measures - including axon radius, axonal water fraction, extra-axonal perpendicular diffusivity, and longitudinal relaxation time - and conduction velocity estimates obtained from a large database of CCEPs, we developed a whole-brain prediction model of conduction velocity. Our multivariate MRI-based model explained 29% of variance in neurophysiological conduction velocity, making it possible to partially predict whole-brain conduction velocity and delay matrices along connections for which no direct measurement is commonly available from epilepsy surgery investigations. This integrative MRI-based approach could provide a non-invasive framework for comprehensively characterising conduction delays in vivo across the human brain white matter.",

    "title": "Palmitoylation of death receptor p75NTR contributes to Alzheimer's Disease progression by regulating APP trafficking and degradation",
    "content": "Although protein palmitoylation has been associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), it remains unclear whether or how palmitoylation of specific proteins contributes to any of the pathological features of AD. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) contributes to AD progression by regulating the intracellular trafficking and amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). p75NTR is palmitoylated at a juxtamembrane cysteine but it is currently unknown whether this has any effect on its role in AD. Here, we report that 5xFAD mice, an animal model of AD, expressing a palmitoylation-deficient mutant of p75NTR (p75C281A) display significantly attenuated neuropathology and cognitive deficits. p75C281A showed enhanced internalization, trafficking to Rab5/Rab7 endosomes and lysosomal-mediated degradation. In mutant p75C281A neurons, APP displayed accelerated co-internalization with p75NTR, increased trafficking to late endosomes and lysosome, and enhanced degradation, thereby limiting neuronal Abeta; production. Interestingly, the brain of 5xFAD mice shows increased levels of p75NTR palmitoylation. These results indicate that palmitoylation of p75NTR enhances its stability and, indirectly, that of APP by reducing their trafficking to the lysosome, resulting in increased Abeta; accumulation and neuropathology in the AD brain. Selective inhibitors of p75NTR palmitoylation may find applications in the treatment of AD.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",
