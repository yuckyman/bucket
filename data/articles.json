    "title": "High-frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Can Improve Attentional Control Under Stress: Behavioral and Electrophysiological Evidence",
    "content": "Psychological stress impairs cognition, forcing attention toward stressor-related information. However, stress may reallocate limited cognitive resources in adaptive ways. How stress modulates the attentional control remains unclear. In this study, the stress-related changes in both target processing and distractor interference were investigated in Experiment 1, where an additional singleton task was employed with a stress group and a control group. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with both stress responses and attentional control. The role of the left DLPFC in regulating attention control under stress was investigated using repetitive TMS in Experiment 2, which included control-vertex, stress-vertex, and stress-DLPFC groups. Electroencephalography was recorded. The results showed that (1) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited increased RT attentional capture effect and greater distractor-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, indicating increased distractor interference under stress; (2) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited a greater target-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, suggesting enhanced target processing under stress; and (3) compared with the stress-vertex group, the stress-DLPFC group exhibited greater target-elicited N2pc effect, but a similar distractor-elicited N2pc effect, suggesting that left-DLPFC stimulation improved target processing but exerted no influence on distractor processing. In addition, faster RTs, along with a reduced RT attentional capture effect, were found for the stress-DLPFC group, implying that the target processing following left-DLPFC stimulation might be less affected by the distractor due to the heightened target processing. The left DLPFC may play a crucial role in modulating attentional control under stress.",

    "title": "A Role of Pupil-linked Arousal, Cingulo-insular Cortex, and Intralaminar Thalamus for Auditory Near-threshold Perception",
    "content": "The perception of near-threshold tones varies strongly across trials, likely because of fluctuations in sustained attention or arousal. We used parallel fMRI and pupillometry to study the role of attention networks for the detection of near-threshold tones in three phases: (1) passive listening, (2) active detection of salient tones, and (3) active detection of near-threshold tones. Results confirmed previous findings from magnetoencephalography that auditory cortex activity and pupil-dilation responses for near-threshold tones were only observed when task-relevant, stronger for hit trials, but also present for miss trials. We then sought which attention-related areas show a similar response pattern, and found it in insular cortex, anterior midcingulate cortex, and inferior precentral sulcus. Moreover, activity in the insula was already stronger for hit than miss trials in the prestimulus interval. Activity for hit trials was also observed in a number of subcortical nuclei, including thalamus, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, and the colliculi. Like insula, activity in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus additionally showed activity for miss trials and stronger activity for hit trials in the baseline. Finally, BOLD activity correlated to spontaneous pupil fluctuations was evaluated and revealed biphasic activation and deactivation in a widespread cortical network, with a maximum 3 sec and minimum 7 sec after pupil dilation. The cortical networks included insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, retro-splenial, and sensory cortex. Overall, these data identify the cingulo-insular network and the intralaminar thalamic nuclei as potential sources of fluctuations in auditory cortex activity in the context of near-threshold tone detection.",

    "title": "Spatial grouping modulates the link between individual alpha frequency and temporal integration windows in crowding",
    "content": "Previous research has linked endogenous alpha oscillations (~7-13 Hz) to temporal integration windows in visual perception, with higher individual alpha frequency (IAF) predicting improved temporal segregation. Here, we investigated whether alpha-rhythmic temporal integration is a factor in visual crowding and whether this relationship is mediated by spatial grouping mechanisms. 47 participants performed a Vernier discrimination task, in which we manipulated both the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between flankers and targets, and the spatial configuration of the flankers. Specifically, flankers were arranged to either induce crowding or \"uncrowding\", through the manipulation of good-Gestalt properties. Our results show that crowding has a temporal integration period of around 170 ms but this varies substantially across individuals. Importantly, resting-state IAF predicted individual variance in temporal integration windows: individuals with faster endogenous alpha rhythms could begin to segregate targets from distractors at shorter SOAs. Crucially, this effect was specific for crowding-inducing flankers and disappeared when flankers led to uncrowding. These results suggest that top-down spatial grouping can overwrite the temporal integration constraint imposed by alpha oscillations, highlighting both the relevance of alpha for understanding limits on peripheral visual processing as well as the flexible and context-dependent role of alpha in temporal integration.",

    "title": "Fast spiking interneurons autonomously generate fast gamma oscillations in the medial entorhinal cortex with excitation strength tuning ING-PING transitions",
    "content": "Gamma oscillations (40-140 Hz) play a fundamental role in neural coordination, facilitating communication and cognitive functions in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). While previous studies suggest that pyramidal-interneuron network gamma (PING) and interneuron network gamma (ING) mechanisms contribute to these oscillations, the precise role of inhibitory circuits remains unclear. Using optogenetic stimulation and whole-cell electrophysiology in acute mouse brain slices, we examined synaptic input and spike timing in neurons across layer II/III mEC. We found that fast-spiking interneurons exhibited robust gamma-frequency firing, while excitatory neurons engaged in gamma cycle skipping. Stellate and pyramidal cells received minimal recurrent excitation, whereas fast-spiking interneurons received strong excitatory input. Both excitatory neurons and fast-spiking interneurons received gamma frequency inhibition, emphasizing the role of recurrent inhibition in gamma rhythm generation. Notably, gamma activity persisted after AMPA/kainate receptor blockade, indicating that interneurons can sustain gamma oscillations independently through an ING mechanism. Selective activation of PV+ interneurons confirmed their ability to sustain fast gamma inhibition autonomously. To further assess the interplay of excitation and inhibition, we developed computational network models constrained by our experimental data. Simulations revealed that weak excitatory input to interneurons supports fast ING-dominated rhythms (~100-140 Hz), while strengthening excitatory drive induces a transition to slower PING-dominated oscillations (60-80 Hz). These findings highlight the dominant role of inhibitory circuits in sustaining gamma rhythms, demonstrate how excitation strength tunes the oscillatory regime, and refine models of entorhinal gamma oscillations critical for spatial memory processing.",

    "title": "Knockout of Perilipin 2 in Microglia Alters Lipid Droplet Accumulation and Response to Alzheimer's Disease Stimuli",
    "content": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are emerging as critical regulators of cellular metabolism and inflammation, with their accumulation in microglia linked to aging and neurodegeneration. Perilipin 2 (Plin2) is a ubiquitously expressed LD associated protein that stabilizes lipid stores, and in peripheral tissues, its upregulation promotes lipid retention, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. However, the role of Plin2 in brain-resident microglia remains undefined. Here, we used CRISPR engineered Plin2 knockout (KO) BV2 microglia to investigate the contribution of Plin2 to lipid accumulation, bioenergetics, and immune function. Compared to wild-type (WT) cells, Plin2 KO microglia exhibited markedly reduced LD burden under both basal and oleic acid loaded conditions. Functionally, this was associated with enhanced phagocytosis of zymosan particles, even after lipid loading, indicating improved clearance capacity in the absence of Plin2. Transcriptomic analyses revealed genotype specific responses to amyloid beta (AB), particularly in pathways related to mitochondrial metabolism. Seahorse assays confirmed that Plin2 KO cells exhibit a distinct bioenergetic profile, characterized by reduced basal respiration and glycolysis, yet preserved mitochondrial capacity, increased spare respiratory reserve, and a blunted glycolytic response to AB. Together, these findings identify Plin2 as a regulator of microglial lipid storage and metabolic state, with its loss alleviating lipid accumulation, improving phagocytic function, and altering AB induced metabolic reprogramming. Targeting Plin2 may therefore represent a potential strategy to modulate microglial metabolism and function in aging and neurodegeneration.",

    "content": "Neuroinflammation is a major pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the regulation of neuroinflammation is critical to therapeutic development. We report here that dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1), well-recognized for its role in mitochondrial fission, is a transcription factor that regulates neuroinflammation. Using multiple inflammatory models, we provide evidence demonstrating that DRP1, when challenged with pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides, translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus, then binds to the promoter region of Rela (encoding NF-{kappa}B) to activate its gene products and other downstream inflammatory cytokines. Our data also demonstrate the significant role of the proinflammatory lipocalin 2 in the brain. In combination, this study highlights a previously unidentified function of DRP1 in mediating neuroinflammation via the NF-{kappa}B-lipocalin 2 axis. Through such mechanisms of DRP1, this study also provides potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases and other conditions linked to inflammation.",

While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>",

Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>",

    "title": "Potentiation of Nigra-Striatal Dopaminergic Projection Underpins Core Autism-Like Behaviors in Valproate-Exposed Mice",
    "content": "<p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the underlying neural circuit dysfunction that accounts for these coexisting symptoms in autism remains poorly understood. Here we revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced functional alterations of dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Specifically, we observed enhanced excitatory input and increased excitability in SNc-&gt;DMS dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in a basal state of potentiation. This potentiated baseline activity blunted the phasic responses of SNc-&gt;DMS projections, as evidenced by reduction of transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DA signaling during social interaction and expression of repetitive behaviors in valproate-exposed male mice. We then utilized chronic chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to selectively manipulate the abnormal basal activity of SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling. This targeted intervention successfully rectified the dysfunction in D1R-expressed medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) associated with social deficits, while simultaneously restoring the functionality of D2-MSNs linked to repetitive behaviors. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that prenatal valproate exposure disrupts SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling, which mediates the coexistence of two core autism-like behaviors by reshaping the dynamics of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moreover, these results highlight potential therapeutic targets for developing interventions for both core symptoms of autism.</p>",

    "title": "Stimulus Contingency and Task Context Encoding within the Anterior Cingulate-Amygdala-Cerebellum Associative Learning Network",
    "content": "<p>Cerebellum (CB) interactions with forebrain systems contribute to learning cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and CB. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and CB are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning CS&ndash;US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. Here, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS&ndash;US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS&ndash;US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, during both stimuli and the intertrial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired trials, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.</p>",

    "title": "Optical Recordings of Unitary Synaptic Connections Reveal High and Random Local Connectivity between CA3 Pyramidal Cells",
    "content": "<p>The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of either sex to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3,078 tested CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch-clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch-clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.</p>",

    "title": "Asymmetries in Foveal Vision",
    "content": "<p>Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human&rsquo;s visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the  foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea in 12 human observers (both sexes). Although the tested foveolar locations were only  away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, the asymmetry is reversed: stimuli presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~ away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.</p>",

In this study, we present a dataset comprising axon imaging volumes along with corresponding annotations to facilitate the evaluation and development of axon reconstruction algorithms. This dataset, derived from 11 mouse brain samples imaged using fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography, contains carefully selected 852 volume images sized at 192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192 voxels. These images exhibit substantial variations in terms of axon density, image intensity, and signal-to-noise ratios, even within localized regions. Conventional methods often struggle when processing such complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a distance field-supervised segmentation network designed to enhance image signals effectively. Our results demonstrate significantly improved axon detection rates across both state-of-the-art and traditional methodologies. The released dataset and benchmark algorithm provide a data foundation for advancing novel axon reconstruction methods and are valuable for accelerating the reconstruction of long-range axonal projections.",

    "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
    "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy.

The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

EEGNetv4 outperformed among other EEG tailored models, and upon utilizing the hybrid fusion techniques it achieves 97.1% accuracy using only 1,609 parameters and less than 1 MB of memory, demonstrating high efficiency. Moreover, FL using FedAvg is implemented across five stratified clients, achieving 96.9% accuracy on the hybrid fused EEGNetV4 model while preserving data privacy.

    "content": "Diaphragm dysfunction represents a significant complication in elderly patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, often resulting in extended intensive care stays, unsuccessful weaning attempts, and increased healthcare expenditures. To address the deficiency of precise, real-time decision support in this context, a novel artificial intelligence framework is proposed, integrating imaging, physiological signals, and ventilator parameters. Initially, a hierarchical Transformer encoder is employed to extract modality-specific embeddings, followed by an attention-guided cross-modal fusion module and a temporal network for dynamic trend prediction. The framework was assessed using three public datasets, which are, the MIMIC-IV, eICU, and Chest X-ray. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy (92.3% on MIMIC-IV, 91.8% on eICU, 92.0% on Chest X-ray) and surpassed all baselines in precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, the model's probability estimates were well-calibrated, and its SHAP-based explainability analysis identified ventilator volume and key imaging features as primary predictors. The clinical implications of this study are significant. By providing precise and interpretable predictions, the proposed model has the potential to transform critical care practices by offering a pathway to more effective and personalized interventions for high-risk patients.",

    "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "title": "Autonomous retrieval for continuous learning in associative memory networks",
    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

    "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThe neuropathological mechanisms specific to male insomnia disorder (ID) remain underexplored, particularly regarding intrinsic brain activity patterns. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study aims to investigate the characteristics of amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) in male patients with primary ID, and to explore the correlations between these neuroimaging indicators and sleep scale scores.MethodsA total of 30 male patients diagnosed with ID and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. All participants underwent standardized assessments with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was utilized to assess regional brain activity abnormalities in male insomnia patients through amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) analyses. Statistical correlations between aberrant ALFF/ReHo values and clinical scale scores were subsequently examined.ResultsPatients with ID showed significantly higher scores on the PSQI, HAMD Rating Scale score, and the ISI, compared with HCs. fMRI results revealed that, relative to HCs, ID patients exhibited reduced ALFF in the Precentral_R and increased ALFF in the Cerebelum_6_R and Temporal_Inf_L (p\u202f<\u202f0.05, cluster level-FWE corrected). Regarding ReHo, patients displayed elevated ReHo values in the Temporal_Inf_L, Cerebelum_6_R, and Hippocampus_R, whereas decreased ReHo values were observed in the Putamen_L, Insula_R, and Calcarine_R (p\u202f<\u202f0.05, cluster level-FWE corrected). However, neither ALFF nor ReHo measures demonstrated significant correlations with clinical scale scores (p\u202f>\u202f0.05).ConclusionMale patients with ID exhibit functional abnormalities in the cerebellum-limbic system circuit and the sensorimotor network. These alterations are accompanied by impaired motor coordination, dysregulated emotional processing, and deficits in sensory integration. Although ALFF and ReHo metrics show no significant correlation with the severity of clinical symptoms, the regional distribution patterns of these indicators across different brain areas suggest that they may serve as an index for ID, rather than a direct reflection of symptomatic manifestations.",

    "title": "Identifying robust neural signatures of acupuncture modulation in healthy brains: a multimodal meta-analysis mapping core network",
    "content": "Acupuncture, a cornerstone of Chinese integrative medicine, demonstrates clinical efficacy for pain- and inflammation-related conditions through extensive clinical practices. Using multimodal neuroimaging techniques (fMRI and PET), numerous studies have investigated acupuncture\u2019s impact on brain structure and function. However, a systematic integration of these findings is still lacking. To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach to identify brain regions that consistently modulated by verum acupuncture in both healthy populations and patients. Critically, establishing neural signatures in healthy populations provides a foundational baseline for normative brain responses, which is essential to detect pathological deviations in patient cohorts. Subsequent behavioral domain analyses elucidated the functional profiles of these significant clusters. To characterize whole brain functional connectivity architecture that associated with identified regions, we employed meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses. Our analyses consistently implicated the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (extending into postcentral gyrus) and right thalamus, key regions within the somatosensory pain processing network, as core neural substrates that modulated by acupuncture in healthy populations. Functional connectivity analyses further demonstrated that these brain clusters engaged a distributed pain-processing network, including bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and insular cortex. Taken together, these findings provide a mechanistic neurobiological basis for acupuncture-induced pain processing and identify potential therapeutic targets within the pain-associated neural circuitry.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024562566, identifier CRD42024562566.",

    "title": "Exploring neurodevelopment through oscillatory and aperiodic EEG activity: methodological and clinical consideration",
    "content": "Understanding the neural dynamics that characterize early brain development is a central goal in neuroscience. Electroencephalography (EEG), is particularly well suited for studying the developing brain, given to its non-invasive nature and high temporal resolution. Spectral analysis of EEG signals reveals two key components: oscillatory activity associated with cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and perception; and aperiodic activity that reflects scale-free neural processes. While traditionally neglected, the aperiodic component has recently emerged as a crucial feature in understanding both typical and atypical brain functioning. This narrative review provides an overview of the most recent evidence regarding these EEG spectral features with a focus on their developmental trajectories and clinical significance. The review is structured into three main sections: (i) methodological considerations for analyzing oscillatory and aperiodic components of EEG spectrum; (ii) developmental changes in EEG spectral features during early childhood; (iii) alterations in spectral activity in children with developmental disorders. By highlighting recent findings and identifying gaps in the literature, this review aims to advance our understanding of how spectral EEG analysis can inform both basic and clinical neuroscience in early development. We emphasize the importance of considering both oscillatory and aperiodic components as a complementary feature of the spectral characteristic of the EEG signal contributing specifically to the characterization of brain functioning. In sum, this review offers updated and comprehensive support for researchers and clinicians working in developmental neuroscience serving both as a starting point for new studies and a bridge toward more effective EEG-based clinical tools.",

    "title": "The human cerebellum encodes temporally sensitive reinforcement learning signals",
    "content": "In addition to supervised motor learning, the cerebellum also supports nonmotor forms of learning, including reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies in animal models have identified core RL signals related to reward processing, reward prediction, and prediction errors in specific regions in cerebellar cortex. However, the computational constraints on these signals remain poorly understood, particularly in humans. Here, we investigated cerebellar RL signals in a computationally-driven fMRI study. Human participants performed an RL task with no low-level sensorimotor contingencies. We observed robust RL signals related to reward processing and reward prediction errors in cognitive regions of the cerebellum (Crus I and II). These signals were not explained by oculomotor or physiological confounds. By manipulating the delay between choices and reward outcomes, we discovered that cerebellar RL signals are temporally sensitive, becoming undetectable at supra-second feedback delays. Similar delay effects were not found in other areas implicated in reward processing, including the ventral striatum and hippocampus. Connectivity analyses revealed that during RL feedback, cognitive areas of the cerebellum coactivate with a network that includes the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus. Together, these results highlight a temporally constrained contribution of the human cerebellum to a cognitive learning task.",

    "title": "Neural computations of visual, semantic, and memorability features in the human brain",
    "content": "Object recognition requires integrated processing that extends beyond the visual cortex, incorporating semantic and memory-related processes. However, it remains unclear how different attributes, such as visual, semantic, and memorability features, are encoded and interact during perception. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography from 5143 channels while participants viewed natural object images. We systematically characterized the spatiotemporal patterns of neural encoding for visual, semantic, and memorability attributes and showed that memorability was encoded in a distributed manner, which can be dissociated from visual and semantic coding. While the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) was engaged in encoding all three attributes, the representations were dissociable. Interestingly, memorability representations in the prefrontal cortex appeared to arise from integrated visual and semantic signals from the VTC; and memorability influenced early stages of visual and semantic processing. Our results were corroborated by high-resolution 7T fMRI, which revealed continuous encoding across the brain, and further validated using a separate dataset featuring within-category object variability. Lastly, single-neuron recordings confirmed semantic and memorability coding in the medial temporal lobe. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of how visual, semantic, and memorability attributes are dynamically encoded across the brain, highlighting the complex interplay between these attributes that collectively shape object recognition and memory formation.",

    "title": "Language laterality and cognitive skills: does anatomy matter?",
    "content": "Brain anatomy, particularly white matter microstructure, is thought to play a critical role in the relationships between cognitive function and language lateralisation. This study investigates whether white matter microstructural parameters of the arcuate fasciculus and corpus callosum is associated with cognitive performance across distinct language lateralisation groups. Neuroimaging and cognitive data from 279 healthy adults were sourced from the BIL&amp;GIN database. Participants completed a sentence production fMRI task, diffusion MRI, and cognitive tasks assessing verbal, visuospatial, and arithmetic skills. Significant positive associations were observed in strongly atypical individuals between fractional anisotropy in the splenium and working memory (R2 = 0.96, pFDR = 0.042) and between FA in the genu and visuospatial attention (R2 = 0.92, pFDR = 0.042). ANCOVA revealed that cross-dominant individuals had significantly lower visuospatial attention scores compared to consistently lateralised individuals (pFDR = 0.02). These findings challenge the notion that atypical lateralisation is inherently maladaptive and suggest that white matter pathways may serve as an alternative mechanism for supporting cognitive function in individuals with rightward language dominance. Furthermore, the results highlight the cognitive disadvantages of crossed dominance, implicating disrupted interhemispheric communication as a potential underlying mechanism.",

    "title": "Brain structure-function coupling - relationship with language lateralisation",
    "content": "Language is one of the most extensively studied lateralised cognitive functions in the human brain, predominantly relying on the left hemisphere in most individuals. However, the mechanisms by which a stable white matter architecture underpins individual language functions remain unclear. Previous studies have employed structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) coupling for individual fingerprinting and task decoding, suggesting that variability in brain entropy may serve as a distinguishing characteristic for language lateralisation. We examined a large cohort of healthy adults (n = 285) to investigate SC-FC coupling and identify markers distinguishing different language laterality groups. Functional connectivity was measured using resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) time-series data, while structural connectivity was determined via probabilistic fibre tractography. SC-FC coupling was investigated using the SENSAAS language atlas and defined as the Pearson correlation between non-zero elements of regional structural and functional connectivity profiles. Group differences were assessed using the PALM toolbox in FSL. Our findings revealed that increased SC-FC coupling in the left precentral sulcus was associated with typical language lateralisation, while increased coupling in the right middle temporal gyrus and left anterior insula was observed in individuals with atypical language lateralisation (pFDR < 0.05). Non-lateralised individuals exhibited increased coupling in the left anterior insula compared to lateralised (pFDR<0.05). SC-FC coupling offers a promising framework to uncover functional and anatomical differences among individuals with varying language lateralisation. This regional specificity indicates that typical, atypical, and non-lateralised profiles rely on different structural-functional alignments, likely reflecting the recruitment of alternative pathways for language processing.",

    "content": "IntroductionMotion sickness often causes passengers to experience negative emotions such as tension, which in turn triggers symptoms like dizziness and nausea, seriously affecting the travel experience of passengers. Previous studies have shown that music can alleviate negative emotions such as tension, but its effect on motion sickness remains unclear, and the differences in the alleviation effect of different types of music on motion sickness need to be quantitatively evaluated.MethodsWe collected Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 30 subjects in a simulated driving environment and constructed a motion sickness recognition model by combining time-and frequency-domain features (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, power spectral density) with classification algorithms. The model achieved accurate identification of passenger motion sickness states. Based on this model, the intervention effects of four types of music (joyful, sad, stirring, and soft) on motion sickness were further evaluated and compared with the control group (taking natural recovery measures).ResultsThe results showed that soft and joyful music had better intervention effects (average reduction of 56.7 and 57.3%, respectively), followed by passionate and sad music (average reduction of 48.3 and 40%, respectively), among which the alleviation effect of sad music was lower than that of the control group (average reduction of 43.3%). In addition, it was verified that the EEG Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity in the occipital region was significantly negatively correlated with the motion sickness grade p = \u22120.625, p < 0.005).DiscussionThe study suggests that personalized music intervention strategies may effectively alleviate motion sickness symptoms of passengers, thereby increasing cabin comfort and improving the travel experience of passengers.",

    "content": "BackgroundThis study presents a novel paradigm termed Contrasting Routines Affecting Bereitschaftspotential (C.R.A.B.), designed to analyze readiness potential (RP) waveforms preceding movements across varying experimental settings. This paradigm continues Libet's work on decision-making, with an emphasis on the motor planning component like in classical Libet experiment. However, existing paradigms for studying RP work poorly across ages (requiring different instructions) and do not accurately identify the components associated with RP formation.New methodThe C.R.A.B. paradigm enables modeling the when-decision through indirect measurements, thereby avoiding reliance on participants' introspective reports. We believe that this framework can isolate the motor planning component from decision-making and is also suitable for implementation with children of different ages and disorders.ResultsAs a proof of concept, we employed the C.R.A.B. paradigm with healthy adult participants to validate its effectiveness. Our findings revealed distinct RP waveform variations across different trial conditions. Comparison with existing methods C.R.A.B. paradigm has several advantages over traditional methods: the design of the experiment provides for the assessment of different components of RP\u2014motor planning, attention level, and spontaneity of decision-making since the design of the experiment is developed in a game form, it is suitable for both children and adults.ConclusionsThe C.R.A.B. paradigm effectively demonstrated differences in RP waveforms across trial types; therefore, this paradigm can be used to study the various components of the RP in detail. Since this paradigm represents a game interface, it is possible to study the RP in children, including children with various disorders.",

    "content": "PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on cognitive flexibility under different levels of task complexity. The hypothesis was that taVNS would enhance cognitive flexibility more effectively under demanding task conditions.MethodA within-subject design was used, involving 24 healthy adults who completed a Dimensional Change Card Sorting task combined with an auditory task of varying difficulty levels (low, medium, high). Participants underwent both active and sham taVNS conditions while performing the tasks. The complexity of the auditory task served to reduce cognitive resources available for the cognitive flexibility task, allowing an assessment of how taVNS modulates cognitive flexibility under different task difficulty conditions.ResultsThe results show that switch costs in the Dimensional Change Card Sorting task increase with task difficulty. In addition, active taVNS reduced switch costs significantly in the high complexity condition, while no differences were observed in the low and medium complexity conditions. This indicates that taVNS is particularly effective in conditions of higher cognitive demand.ConclusionThe findings suggest that taVNS enhances cognitive flexibility, especially in more complex tasks, providing a better understanding of the effects of taVNS on cognitive control.",

    "title": "The slowest timescales of neural synchronization reveal the strongest influence of auditory distraction",
    "content": "IntroductionAmong all the sounds occurring at any given time, people are often interested in listening to just one. Some competing sounds are merely background noise, whereas others distract attention from target sounds and are less easily suppressed. During active listening, the central auditory pathway unmixes target and distractor sounds based on temporal differences across three orders of magnitude \u2013 from millisecond differences in acoustic temporal fine structure to slower perceptual grouping factors that stretch out to multiple seconds. We developed an approach to directly measure central auditory encoding of multiplexed target and distractor sound features in human listeners to determine which timescales are most impacted by the presence of distracting sounds.MethodsTarget sounds contained nested features along four timescales, including temporal fine structure (~500 Hz), temporal envelope (~25\u201380 Hz), envelope changes (~7 Hz), and slower changes reflecting whether target stimuli were randomly arranged or formed a repeating pattern (~0.5 Hz). Targets were presented with competing sounds that provided variable distraction levels: either a highly distracting melody or a less distracting noise. Neural synchronization to each timescale was simultaneously measured for target and distractor sounds from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during a listening task.ResultsSustained shifts from random to regular sequence arrangements were reliably perceived, yet did not evoke a pattern recognition potential, nor neural synchronization changes at any timescale. Synchronization to relatively slow changes in envelope transitions of the target sound deteriorated with the addition of more distracting sounds while synchronization to more rapid fluctuations in the fine structure or envelope were unaffected by varying distraction level. Categorizing trials by task performance revealed a conjunction of enhanced entrainment to slower temporal features in the distractor sound and reduced synchronization to the target sound on error trials.DiscussionBy designing a stimulus paradigm that leveraged the temporal processing capabilities of the auditory nervous system, we were able to simultaneously quantify multiple target and distractor sound features reproduced in the EEG. This paradigm identified synchronization processes which may prove valuable for research on clinical populations who report difficulty suppressing awareness of distracting sounds.",

    "content": "The Japanese language has a unique writing system that consists of kanji (morphograms, derived from Chinese characters) and kana (phonograms, a simplified form of kanji representing syllables). A kanji character has two distinct ways of reading: on-reading (Chinese-style pronunciation) and kun-reading (native Japanese pronunciation). Some kanji words have irregular kun-reading called jukujikun. Furthermore, kana characters have two script forms: hiragana (cursive form) and katakana (square form), each of which is used for different purposes. Because of these features, Japanese individuals with alexia and agraphia show characteristic symptoms. Lesion-to-symptom analyses and functional imaging studies developed beginning in the 1970s have reported the following findings: (1) kanji\u2013kana dissociation in alexia/agraphia: pure alexia for kanji or kana, lexical agraphia for kanji, and phonological agraphia for kana; (2) on-kun dissociation in alexia: predominant kun-reading and jukujikun reading impairment in semantic dementia and selective on-reading impairment in the extensive posterior middle temporal gyrus lesion; and (3) allographic agraphia between hiragana and katakana.",

    "title": "Predicting attachment style from EEG data on the Flanker task",
    "content": "Bowlby's attachment theory describes the differences that people exhibit in the way they form emotional bonds with others. The dimensional measure of attachment describes it by the magnitude of anxiety and an avoidance dimension, which are currently measured using a self-report questionnaire. Recent advances in neurophysiological methods have started exploring the neural underpinnings of attachment styles. Nonetheless, a conspicuous gap remains: the underexplored realm of predictive models for predicting attachment styles based on objective physiological data. With that in mind, we have constructed a model for inferring individual attachment profiles, based solely on their brain signals recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG). For that aim, we recorded EEG data of 27 participants engaged in the Flanker task and receiving either positive or negative feedback following each trial. We then utilized the recently developed ROCKET algorithm (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) to automatically extract 20,000 time-series features from the EEG data. Next, we applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reduced the number of features to 87 individual components that were used to construct regression models predicting participants' anxiety and avoidance scores, as measured by the ECR-R questionnaire. Our results show, for the first time, that individual attachment profiles can be inferred from EEG data, allowing post hoc categorization into the four canonical attachment styles. This offers two key contributions: first, it provides an objective alternative to traditional self-report questionnaires, helping reduce subjectivity bias in attachment assessment. Second, it highlights the value of using automatically generated features over the limited set of hand-crafted features typically found in the literature.",

    "title": "A robust and effective framework for 3D scene reconstruction and high-quality rendering in nasal endoscopy surgery",
    "content": "In nasal endoscopic surgery, the narrow nasal cavity restricts the surgical field of view and the manipulation of surgical instruments. Therefore, precise real-time intraoperative navigation, which can provide precise 3D information, plays a crucial role in avoiding critical areas with dense blood vessels and nerves. Although significant progress has been made in endoscopic 3D reconstruction methods, their application in nasal scenarios still faces numerous challenges. On the one hand, there is a lack of high-quality, annotated nasal endoscopy datasets. On the other hand, issues such as motion blur and soft tissue deformations complicate the nasal endoscopy reconstruction process. To tackle these challenges, a series of nasal endoscopy examination videos are collected, and the pose information for each frame is recorded. Additionally, a novel model named Mip-EndoGS is proposed, which integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction and rendering and a diffusion module to reduce image blurring in endoscopic data. Meanwhile, by incorporating an adaptive low-pass filter into the rendering pipeline, the aliasing artifacts (jagged edges) are mitigated, which occur during the rendering process. Extensive quantitative and visual experiments show that the proposed model is capable of reconstructing 3D scenes within the nasal cavity in real-time, thereby offering surgeons more detailed and precise information about the surgical scene. Moreover, the proposed approach holds great potential for integration with AR-based surgical navigation systems to enhance intraoperative guidance.",

    "title": "Design and analysis of combined discrete-time zeroing neural network for solving time-varying nonlinear equation with robot application",
    "content": "Zeroing neural network (ZNN) is viewed as an effective solution to time-varying nonlinear equation (TVNE). In this paper, a further study is shown by proposing a novel combined discrete-time ZNN (CDTZNN) model for solving TVNE. Specifically, a new difference formula, which is called the Taylor difference formula, is constructed for first-order derivative approximation by following Taylor series expansion. The Taylor difference formula is then used to discretize the continuous-time ZNN model in the previous study. The corresponding DTZNN model is obtained, where the direct Jacobian matrix inversion is required (being time consuming). Another DTZNN model for computing the inverse of Jacobian matrix is established to solve the aforementioned limitation. The novel CDTZNN model for solving the TVNE is thus developed by combining the two models. Theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed CDTZNN model. The CDTZNN applicability is further indicated by applying the proposed model to the motion planning of robot manipulators.",

    "content": "Myoelectric control systems translate electromyographic signals (EMG) from muscles into movement intentions, allowing control over various interfaces, such as prosthetics, wearable devices, and robotics. However, a major challenge lies in enhancing the system's ability to generalize, personalize, and adapt to the high variability of EMG signals. Artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks, has shown promising decoding performance when applied to large datasets. However, highly parameterized deep neural networks usually require extensive user-specific data with ground truth labels to learn individual unique EMG patterns. However, the characteristics of the EMG signal can change significantly over time, even for the same user, leading to performance degradation during extended use. In this work, we propose an innovative three-stage neural network training scheme designed to progressively develop an adaptive workflow, improving and maintaining the network performance on 28 subjects over 2 days. Experiments demonstrate the importance and necessity of each stage in the proposed framework.",

    "title": "Integrated neural network framework for multi-object detection and recognition using UAV imagery",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate vehicle analysis from aerial imagery has become increasingly vital for emerging technologies and public service applications such as intelligent traffic management, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and military surveillance. However, analyzing UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep learning\u2013driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV platforms.MethodThe framework suggests using today\u2019s best neural networks that are made to solve different problems in aerial vehicle analysis. RetinexNet is used in preprocessing to make the lighting of each input frame consistent. Using HRNet for semantic segmentation allows for accurate splitting between vehicles and their surroundings. YOLOv11 provides high precision and quick vehicle detection and Deep SORT allows reliable tracking without losing track of individual cars. CSRNet are used for vehicle counting that is unaffected by obstacles or traffic jams. LSTM models capture how a car moves in time to forecast future positions. Combining DenseNet and SuperPoint embeddings that were improved with an AutoEncoder is done during feature extraction. In the end, using an attention function, Vision Transformer-based models classify vehicles seen from above. Every part of the system is developed and included to give the improved performance when the UAV is being used in real life.ResultsOur proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of vehicle analysis from UAV imagery. Our pipeline was rigorously evaluated on two famous datasets, AU-AIR and Roundabout. On the AU-AIR dataset, the system achieved a detection accuracy of 97.8%, a tracking accuracy of 96.5%, and a classification accuracy of 98.4%. Similarly, on the Roundabout dataset, it reached 96.9% detection accuracy, 94.4% tracking accuracy, and 97.7% classification accuracy. These results surpass previous benchmarks, demonstrating the system\u2019s robust performance across diverse aerial traffic scenarios. The integration of advanced models, YOLOv11 for detection, HRNet for segmentation, Deep SORT for tracking, CSRNet for counting, LSTM for trajectory prediction, and Vision Transformers for classification enables the framework to maintain high accuracy even under challenging conditions like occlusion, variable lighting, and scale variations.DiscussionThe outcomes show that the chosen deep learning system is powerful enough to deal with the challenges of aerial vehicle analysis and gives reliable and precise results in all the aforementioned tasks. Combining several advanced models ensures that the system works smoothly even when dealing with problems like people being covered up and varying sizes.",

    "content": "In deep-sea areas, the hoisting operation of offshore wind turbines is seriously affected by waves, and the secondary impact is prone to occur between the turbine and the pile foundation. To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated wave compensation system for offshore wind turbines based on a neuromorphic vision (NeuroVI) camera. The system employs a NeuroVI camera to achieve non-contact, high-precision, and low-latency displacement detection of hydraulic cylinders, overcoming the limitations of traditional magnetostrictive displacement sensors, which exhibit slow response and susceptibility to interference in harsh marine conditions. A dynamic simulation model was developed using AMESim-Simulink co-simulation to analyze the compensation performance of the NeuroVI-based system under step and sinusoidal wave disturbances. Comparative results demonstrate that the NeuroVI feedback system achieves faster response times and superior stability over conventional sensors. Laboratory-scale model tests and real-world application in the installation of a 5.2\u202fMW offshore wind turbine validated the system\u2019s feasibility and robustness, enabling real-time collaborative control of turbine and cylinder displacement to effectively mitigate multi-impact risks. This research provides an innovative approach for deploying neural perception technology in complex marine scenarios and advances the development of neuro-robotic systems in ocean engineering.",

    "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

    "content": "BackgroundMyalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multisystemic disease characterized by exertional intolerance and fatigue which is often accompanied by muscle weakness and fatiguability. A study showed efficacy of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine on cardiac output in ME/CFS patients. Pyridostigmine is currently used off-label in ME/CFS and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.MethodsWe evaluated the effect of pyridostigmine on hand grip strength in 20 patients with post-infectious ME/CFS. Hand grip strength testing was performed ten times using an electric dynamometer and was repeated after 1\u202fh. In a second test, 30\u202fmg of pyridostigmine was given immediately after the first measurement. Orthostatic function was assessed using a passive standing test. Neurological examination and autoantibody testing were performed to rule out a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.ResultsAll patients had reduced maximum hand grip strength with a median of 16.45\u202fkg (IQR: 11.45\u202fkg\u201322.8\u202fkg). Hand grip strength was diminished by a median of 4.65\u202fkg after 1 h. In contrast, 1 h after pyridostigmine administration, patients showed an improvement in maximum hand grip strength with a median increase of 2.6\u202fkg. The maximum hand grip strength after exertion was about 1.5-fold higher with then without pyridostigmine (p\u202f= 0.01). The increase in heart rate from lying to standing was median 17 beats per minute without pyridostigmine (IQR: 13 beats per minute \u2013 23 beats per minute) and 13 beats per minute (IQR: 9 beats per minute \u2013 20 beats per minute) (p\u202f=\u202f0.017) with pyridostigmine. None of the patients tested positive for myasthenia gravis specific autoantibodies.ConclusionPyridostigmine exerts an immediate effect on muscle strength and orthostatic function. This may be attributed to increased acetylcholine availability at neuromuscular junctions, and its augmentation of parasympathetic tone.",

Nevertheless, the precise pathological mechanisms underlying CPBP remain elusive. The present study seeks to investigate microstructural changes in gray matter among individuals with CPBP and to evaluate associations between these changes and clinical scale scores via voxel-based morphometry (VBM).Materials and methodsWe recruited 20 people having CPBP and 20 healthy controls (HCs) who were of the same sex and age. T1-weighted imaging in three dimensions (3D-T1WI) was performed on each participant. Using VBM, volumes of gray matter in each region were measured. Volume differences between groups were measured, and it was methodically examined how the volume in particular brain regions correlated with clinical markers.ResultsWe found no discernible age difference between the groups (P > 0.05). Compared with HCs, patients with CPBP showed reduced gray matter volume across multiple brain regions (P < 0.05). These regions encompassed the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, right medial frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left cerebellum posterior lobe, left fusiform gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left cuneus, inferior parietal lobule, right medial frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus.

    "title": "Advances in HD-EMG interfaces and spatial algorithms for upper limb prosthetic control",
    "content": "Upper limb amputation significantly affects daily functioning and quality of life. Although myoelectric prostheses offer a promising avenue for restoring motor capabilities, high rates of device abandonment underscore challenges in control performance and user integration. Recent advances in high-density electromyography (HD-EMG) and machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown potential to enhance prosthetic dexterity. HD-EMG interfaces capture richer spatial and temporal muscle activation data, while ML algorithms exploit this information to improve intention detection and motion control. This mini-review explores advancements in HD-EMG acquisition systems, including both interface designs and recording technologies, as well as ML algorithms leveraging spatial information. In addition to summarizing the current state of the art, we discuss the challenges and the opportunities of embedding these technologies in prosthetic systems, with the objective of facilitating the translation of laboratory research into clinical applications.",

    "title": "Ineffectiveness of pioglitazone in cognitive impairment induced by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil via oxidative stress and neuroinflammation",
    "content": "Research objectiveChemotherapy is frequently linked to enduring cognitive impairments in individuals who have survived cancer. The cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) regimen is a standard protocol in cancer treatment. Pioglitazone (PGZ), an oral medication used to treat diabetes, has demonstrated neuroprotective effects against certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PGZ in mitigating cognitive dysfunction caused by CMF.Materials and methodsForty male rats were allocated into four distinct groups: control, CMF-treated, PGZ-treated, and CMF\u202f+\u202fPGZ-treated, to evaluate survival rates, body weights, and cognitive performance using the Y-maze, novel object recognition test (NORT), and fear conditioning memory assessments. Furthermore, the investigation included an analysis of mitochondrial complex I activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) within the hippocampus.ResultsThe CMF and CMF\u202f+\u202fPGZ groups exhibited decreased survival rates (50 and 40%, respectively) and reductions in body weight (16 and 11%, respectively). The Y-maze showed fewer entries and less time in the novel arm, but total entries were unchanged. The NORT revealed less exploration of the novel object in both CMF and CMF\u202f+\u202fPGZ groups. In fear conditioning, both groups showed reduced freezing time versus control, indicating memory impairment. Furthermore, mitochondrial complex I activity was diminished, and levels of ROS, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 were elevated in CMF; however, co-treatment with PGZ did not ameliorate these alterations.ConclusionThe CMF treatment resulted in cognitive dysfunction, and the addition of PGZ did not alleviate this neurotoxicity.",

    "title": "The enhancement of nodal properties in the dorsal visual pathway is associated with compensatory mechanisms of visuospatial cognitive abilities following total sleep deprivation",
    "content": "IntroductionVision is the most critical sensory perception in humans, however, total sleep deprivation (TSD) impairs visuospatial cognitive abilities. While evidence suggests that the brain actively counteracts the adverse effects of TSD to preserve visual cognition, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood.MethodsTo explore the compensatory mechanisms of TSD on visuospatial cognition, we collected resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 24 participants at baseline state (BS) and after 36 h of TSD, along with behavioral data from a mental rotation task. Graph theory-based analyses were employed to assess global and nodal network properties.ResultsBehaviorally, reaction time (RT) significantly increased under TSD compared to BS, indicating impaired spatial cognition. In contrast, accuracy (ACC) for mirrored 120\u00b0 trials significantly improved under TSD, suggesting that participants invested greater effort in more demanding tasks and adopted a strategy of prolonged RT to maintain ACC. EEG findings revealed a significant increase in the small-worldness index (sigma) after TSD, which positively correlated with the improvement in ACC for mirrored 120\u00b0 trials. Nodal properties in the dorsal visual pathway, particularly in parietal regions, were significantly enhanced following TSD. Similarly, nodal properties in the left middle frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus were significantly strengthened, and these enhancements were positively associated with the increase of ACC in mirrored 120\u00b0 trials.DiscussionThese results demonstrate that individuals compensate for TSD-induced visual cognitive deficits by enhancing small-world network property and information transfer efficiency in the dorsal visual pathway. Additionally, top-down control is mediated by the middle frontal gyrus, while bottom-up information integration is facilitated by the superior temporal gyrus.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe neural mechanisms underlying somatosensory processing in individuals with acquired single-sided deafness (SSD) and potential central neuronal cross-modal reorganization remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the impact of SSD on somatosensory perception and attentional processing.MethodsElectrophysiological responses using EEG, and behavioral measures (discrimination thresholds, hit rates and reaction times) were assessed in adults with acquired SSD and normal-hearing (NH) controls for vibrotactile stimulation at two distinct frequencies. Differences in cortical somatosensory evoked potentials between adults with acquired SSD and normal-hearing (NH) controls, focusing on peak amplitudes and peak times of key event-related potential components (P50, N70, P100, N140, and P3b) and their cortical generators were assessed.ResultsWhile both groups exhibited comparable behavioral performance, significant differences emerged in electrophysiological responses. Individuals with SSD showed increased P3b amplitude (albeit non-significant) and significantly delayed P3b peak times, indicating that individuals with acquired SSD exhibit alterations in attentional mechanisms associated with somatosensory perception. In addition, source localization analysis of the P50 component using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) revealed group differences in cortical activation patterns, with SSD individual showing additional recruitment of auditory-related areas, including the superior temporal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus and the insula. This further supports the notion of compensatory neuroplasticity in auditory pathways following severe to profound unilateral hearing loss.ConclusionOur results indicate that SSD is associated with neural reorganization in somatosensory and auditory pathways. The observed modifications in both early and late somatosensory responses, coupled with alterations in source activity, suggest that individuals with SSD engage alternative neural mechanisms when processing vibrotactile stimuli, differing from the typical patterns observed in NH individuals. Understanding these changes prior to cochlear implantation will facilitate the development of personalized auditory rehabilitation strategies following cochlear implantation.",

    "title": "Molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease onset in a mouse model: effects of cannabidiol treatment",
    "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative condition involving a complex blend of disturbances in synaptic development and maintenance, neurovascular cross-talk, ionic and nutrient transport, and mitochondrial metabolism. The precise molecular profile of AD onset with insight for major pathological contributors remains unclear with corresponding impedances in therapeutic development. The current study sought two objectives, as (i) to resolve the molecular pathogenesis from cognitive impairment to the onset of AD-like neuropathology and (ii) whether the novel agent cannabidiol (CBD), noted for its neuroprotective effects, influences the molecular transition associated with AD onset.MethodsDietary CBD was administered daily (80\u2013100 mg/kg/day) in male 3xTg-AD mice and wild-type B6129SF2/J animals from 4.5 to 6.5 mo of age with inclusion of vehicle controls. RNA sequencing encompassed longitudinal and cross-sectional blood and brain samples, respectively. Metabolomics and behavioral analyses examined brain regions (cortex, hippocampus) and associated integrated neurocircuitry.Results and discussionThere were >1,000 differentially expressed markers of AD onset, whereby >75% were either eliminated or reversed in the direction of expression in response to CBD. Signaling pathways encompassed synaptic development and plasticity (e.g., Foxp2), neurovascular interactions (Smad9, Angptl6), receptors and ion channels (Gria4, Chrna2, Rgs7/Rgs7bp), mitochondrial genes (Ndufa7, Cox7a2), immunity (Ncr1), oxidation-reduction (Esr1), lipid synthesis (Fasn, ApoE), and carbohydrate metabolism (Mafa, Mlxipl). As potentially addressable with CBD treatment, AD onset represents molecular integration of neurovascular interactions, channelopathies, metabolic disturbances, and aberrations in developmental genes with involvement of major pathological contributors such as inflammation, oxidative signaling, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.",

    "title": "Computational analysis of optogenetic inhibition of CA1 neurons using a data-efficient and interpretable potassium and chloride conducting opsin model",
    "content": "Objective. Optogenetic inhibition of excitatory neuronal populations has emerged as a potential strategy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. However, achieving effective seizure suppression in animal models using optogenetic techniques has proven challenging. This difficulty can be attributed to a suboptimal stimulation method that involves numerous complex variables. This study aims to examine how various stimulation parameters and opsin characteristics influence the efficacy of optogenetic inhibition protocols. Additionally, a new opsin model is introduced that permits easy implementation of the experimentally derived parameters describing the opsin\u2019s opening and closing dynamics. Approach. The mathematical description of a chloride and potassium conducting opsin was combined with a conductance-based model of a pyramidal CA1 neuron. Simulations with varying parameters were conducted to explore the effects of the stimulation paradigm and the neuronal environment on inhibition. A simplified, adaptable opsin model was used to test the robustness of these results and explore the impact of variations in opsin characteristics. Main results. Stronger inhibition was achieved with higher illumination intensities, pulse repetition frequencies, and duty cycles. Potassium conducting opsins were found to be more stable than chloride conducting ones. These findings were independent of the opsin\u2019s parameters. Additionally, changes in the opsin\u2019s dynamics had negligible impact when the opening and closing time constants were varied by factors between 0.5 and 2. Significance. This study provides key insights into the stimulation and physiological parameters that affect optogenetic inhibition. The findings highlight the importance of choosing the right stimulation protocol and opsin for optimizing optogenetic strategies. The newly developed opsin model also offers a new, valuable tool that will facilitate future research into the development of an improved optogenetic modulation protocol for seizure suppression.",

    "title": "Towards a closed loop retinal prosthesis: measuring electrically evoked retinal responses using large electrodes",
    "content": "Objective. Sensory prostheses use arrays of electrodes to stimulate neural tissue and restore a sense of vision or hearing. At perceptible levels of stimulation, the current from each electrode spreads and causes overlapping regions of neural activation. This lack of specificity results in perceptual deficits. Methods to overcome this reduced specificity, such as a closed loop stimulation approach require measurement of the neural response to stimulation. This investigation tests the possibility of using the large stimulating electrodes such as those required by some subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal implants to measure the neural response to stimulation, an approach similar to Evoked Compound Action Potentials measurements used in cochlear implants. Approach. Ex vivo tissue samples from Long Evans rats with healthy retinas and Royal College of Surgeon rats with retinal degeneration were used to investigate both stimulating and recording from electrodes of the same array. A hexagonal array was used with 20 platinum electrodes with 500 \u03bcm diameter and 700 \u03bcm pitch. Post-stimulus voltage decay was reduced with appropriate tuning of a triphasic stimulation pulse and in post-analysis with a high-pass filter. A method using alternating polarities of biphasic pulses was also trialed. A cocktail of synaptic and ion channel blockers was used to block all neural response including action potentials and thus confirm the biological origin of the signal. Main Results. It was found that a neural signal was observable on electrode that were sufficiently distant from the stimulating electrodes. The signal appeared to be due to direct activation of ganglion cells or possibly mediated via inner retinal neurons. Significance. This result confirms that recording usable neural signals from large electrodes is possible, which is an essential step in implementing a closed loop stimulation strategy for a subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis.",

    "title": "Deep brain stimulation-induced local evoked potentials outperform spectral features in spatial and clinical STN mapping",
    "content": "Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Yet, optimizing lead placement and stimulation programming remains challenging. Current techniques rely on imaging and intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MER), while programming relies on trial-and-error clinical testing, which can be time-consuming. DBS-induced local evoked potentials (DLEP), also known as evoked resonant neural activity, have emerged as a potential alternative electrophysiological marker for mapping. However, direct comparisons with traditional spectral features, such as beta-band, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and aperiodic component are lacking. Approach. We evaluated DLEP across 39 STN DBS leads in 31 subjects with PD undergoing DBS surgery, using both a single-pulse and high-frequency (HF) burst stimulation paradigms. We developed a novel artifact-removal method to enable monopolar DLEP recovery, including estimating the DLEP amplitudes at stimulated contacts, further enhancing spatial sampling of DLEP. We evaluated spectral features and DLEP in respect to imaging-based and MER-based localization, and its predictive power for post-operative programming. Main results. DLEP showed great spatial consistency, maximizing within STN with 100% accuracy for single-pulse and 84.62% for burst stimulation, surpassing spectral measures including beta (89.74%) and HFO (82.05%). DLEP better correlated with clinical outcomes (single-pulses \u03c1 = \u22120.33, HF bursts \u03c1 = \u22120.26), than spectral measures (beta \u03c1 = \u22120.25, HFO \u03c1 = 0.05). Furthermore, single-pulses at low-frequencies are sufficient for DLEP-based mapping. Significance. We show how DLEP provide higher STN-spatial specificity and correlation with postoperative programming compared to spectral features. To support clinical translation of DLEP, we developed two methods aimed to recover artifact-free DLEP and estimating DLEP amplitudes at stimulating contacts. DLEP appear distinct from beta and HFO activity, yet strongly tied to aperiodic spectral components, suggesting that DLEP amplitude reflects underlying STN excitability. This study highlights that DLEP are a robust and clinically valuable marker for DBS targeting and programming.",

    "title": "Refining signal localization: a transcranial magnetic stimulation motor mapping approach to functional near-infrared spectroscopy",
    "content": "Objective. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising brain imaging tool due to its cost-effectiveness and balance between spatial and temporal resolution. However, its reliance on the 10-20 EEG coordinate system for probe placement introduces potential inaccuracies in cortical localization. Despite concerns regarding its spatial precision, the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with fNIRS for validating signal localization has not been systematically explored. This study aimed to demonstrate the interindividual variability in hand motor representations and how it influences the precision of fNIRS recordings during motor tasks. Approach. Neuronavigated TMS was employed on 18 neurotypical adults to map the motor representations of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and fourth dorsal interosseous (4DI) muscles. Center-of-gravity (CoG) coordinates from TMS-evoked motor maps were compared with fNIRS channel locations, including the theoretical hand channel defined by the 10-20 EEG system. FNIRS signals were recorded during a hand-grasp motor task, and the subject-specific hand channel was determined by identifying the fNIRS channel closest to the individual\u2019s TMS CoG. Main Results. TMS motor mapping revealed substantial interindividual variability, with 56% of participants demonstrating deviations from the theoretical fNIRS hand channel. TMS motor maps showed that the FDI and 4DI representations were closely positioned, with the 4DI representation slightly anterior to the FDI (p = 0.022). Analysis of fNIRS signals indicated that subject-specific hand channels exhibited significantly higher hemodynamic response amplitudes compared to the theoretical hand channel (p = 0.0004), suggesting enhanced signal sensitivity when using individualized cortical mapping. Additionally, fNIRS signal variance was significantly higher in the theoretical channel, indicating greater signal variability and lower signal robustness. Significance. These findings highlight the limitations of rigidly applying the 10-20 EEG system for spatial localization in fNIRS-based motor studies and show the benefits of integrating TMS-derived cortical mapping for improved signal accuracy and robustness.",

    "content": "Objective. The precise mapping of speech-related functions is crucial for successful neurosurgical interventions in epilepsy and brain tumor cases. Traditional methods like electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) are effective but carry a significant risk of inducing seizures. Methods. To address this, we have prepared a comprehensive ESM\u2009+\u2009electrocorticographic mapping (ECM) dataset from 14 patients with chronically implanted stereo-EEG electrodes. Then we explored several compact machine learning (ML) approaches to convert the ECM signals to the ground truth derived from the risky ESM procedure. Both procedures involved the standard picture naming task. As features, we used gamma-band power within successive temporal windows in the data averaged with respect to picture and voice onsets. We focused on a range of classifiers, including XGBoost, linear support vector classification (SVC), regularized logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, multi-Layer perceptron, AdaBoost and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers and equipped them with confidence interval estimates, crucial in a real-life application. We validated the ML approaches using a leave-one-patient-out procedure and computed ROC and Precision\u2013Recall curves for various feature combinations. Results. For linear SVC we achieved ROC-AUC and PR-AUC scores of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, which effectively distinguishes speech-related from non-related iEEG channels. We have also observed that the use of information on the voice onset moment notably improved the classification accuracy. Significance. We have for the first time rigorously compared the ECM and ESM results and mimicked a real-life use of the ECM technology.

    "title": "Instantaneous recognition method for lower limb continuous motion based on onset-window surface electromyography data",
    "content": "Objective. Human\u2013robot collaboration in lower-limb rehabilitation devices imposes stringent requirements on both the recognition accuracy of motion intention and real-time responsiveness. The precise recognition of lower limb motion based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has always been a primary focus of study. However, achieving low-delay recognition in lower limb continuous motion while maintaining accuracy remains a challenge, which is key to unlocking the full potential for the effective deployment and widespread application of robots. Approach. An innovative recognition method in lower limb continuous motion was presented in this paper, which investigated the instantaneous recognition network (IRN) and continuous recognition (CR) model. Main results. The comparative analysis revealed that by utilizing an optimal length of 210 for the onset-window sEMG data, the proposed IRN could substantially reduce the time delay from 300 ms/350 ms to 60 ms at the methodological level. The implementation of the class-balanced method enhanced motion recognition accuracy by an additional 4.83% within the onset window. The CR model was validated across seven scenarios, comprehensively covering all potential situations in daily continuous movements, and achieved an average accuracy of 96.31%. Significance. This study demonstrates the potential of the proposed instantaneous recognition method to enhance performance in lower limb continuous motion, providing an innovative approach for research on human\u2013robot synchronization.",

    "title": "Extracting robust single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials for non-invasive brain computer interfaces",
    "content": "Objective. Reliable extraction of single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) is essential for developing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications to support rehabilitation after brain injury. For real-time feedback, these responses must be extracted prospectively on every trial, with minimal post-processing and artifact correction. However, noninvasive SEPs elicited by electrical stimulation at recommended parameter settings (0.1\u20130.2 msec pulse width, stimulation at or below motor threshold, 2\u20135 Hz frequency) are typically small and variable, often requiring averaging across multiple trials or extensive processing. Here, we describe and evaluate ways to optimize the stimulation setup to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of noninvasive single-trial SEPs, enabling more reliable extraction. Approach. SEPs were recorded with scalp electroencephalography in tibial nerve stimulation in thirteen healthy people, and two people with CNS injuries. Three stimulation frequencies (lower than recommended: 0.2 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz) with a pulse width longer than recommended (1 msec), at a stimulation intensity based on H-reflex and M-wave at Soleus muscle were evaluated. Detectability of single-trial SEPs relative to background noise was tested offline and in a pseudo-online analysis, followed by a real-time demonstration. Mainresults. SEP N70 was observed predominantly at the central scalp regions. Online decoding performance was significantly higher with Laplacian filter. Generalization performance showed an expected degradation, at all frequencies, with an average decrease of 5.9% (multivariate) and 6.5% (univariate), with an AUC score ranging from 0.78\u20130.90. The difference across stimulation frequencies was not significant. In individuals with injuries, AUC of 0.86 (incomplete spinal cord injury) and 0.81 (stroke) was feasible. Real-time demonstration showed SEP detection with AUC of 0.89. Significance. This study describes and evaluates a system for extracting single-trial SEPs in real-time, suitable for a BCI-based operant conditioning. It enhances SNR of individual SEPs by alternate electrical stimulation parameters, dry headset, and optimized signal processing.",

    "title": "Unveiling functional heterogeneity in anatomical functional areas: a framework for fine-grained functional connectivity analysis of wide-field calcium imaging data",
    "content": "Objective. Conventional functional connectivity (FC) analysis of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data relies on the assumption of homogeneity within predefined anatomical functional areas (FAs), where the signal averaged within each FA serves as the foundation for inter-FA connectivity modeling. However, accumulating evidence suggested significant intra-FA functional heterogeneity with functionally distinct subregions. This study aims to systematically examine the existence of the heterogeneity and the consequences of violating the homogeneity assumption on the FC analysis. Approach. We propose a three-step approach: (1) The spatiotemporal clustering of pixels with similar activity dynamics into functional parcels (FPs). (2) Classifying FPs according to their cortex-wide connectivity profiles into four categories: cross-hemispheric (CH), unihemispheric (UH), cross-modal (CM) and unimodal (UM). (3) Gauging the consequences and utility of above analysis. Main results. Analysis of adult mice WFCI data (n = 6) shows that pixels can be reliably clustered into FPs, and that FPs fall into different categories and form distinct subregions, unveiling the functional heterogeneity within each FA. Crucially, fine-grained FC analysis for different categories of subregions uncovered significant differences compared to the results from the conventional method. Application of the analysis to longitudinal WFCI data on mouse brain development (n = 17) demonstrates increases in CM and CH subregions and decreases in UM and UH subregions over time, in line with expectations based on prior research into neurodevelopment and network reorganization. Significance. The present study develops a fine-grained FC analysis framework, leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution of WFCI to more precisely characterize large-scale cortical network dynamics. The observed differences between FCs derived using the proposed framework and those from conventional methods highlight the need for caution regarding the functional homogeneity assumption in conventional FC analysis. Furthermore, the developmental regularities revealed in longitudinal mouse brain data demonstrate the utility of fine-grained FC analysis.",

    "content": "Objectives. Reconstruction of visual perception from brain signals has emerged as a promising research topic. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a kind of high-quality intracranial signal with good spatiotemporal resolution that offers some new opportunities. However, according to our knowledge, there are no studies to reconstruct the perceived images from human ECoG signals at present. Approach. We have conducted the pioneering work and developed a novel pipeline that integrates Talairach coordinate alignment masked autoencoders (TA-MAE) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our approach exploits the spatiotemporal dynamics of human ECoG signals, enabling the restoration of details in high-resolution. Main results. Experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of appearance, structure, signal-noise ratio, and semantic consistency. Additionally, our study indicated that unsupervised learning-based signal reconstruction outperforms manually annotated label-guided feature recognition in capturing the low-dimensional representation of brain signals, potentially facilitating the exploration of vision\u2019s intrinsic mechanisms. Significance. These results highlight the advantages of unsupervised decoding and provide a generalizable framework for human ECoG-based visual reconstruction.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

For teleoperation systems to replicate these real-life interactions, tactile sensation must be presented and distributed across the entire fingertip. Thus, understanding the distribution of tactile acuity at the fingertip is imperative. Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA).

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: There is a need for effective cognitive assessment tools to evaluate the development of very young children in resource-limited low- and middle-income country settings. Our objective was to evaluate the field usability of a computer-based attention test and its concurrent validity with a caregiver-reported screener of neurodevelopment in rural, Ecuadorian children. Method: To assess a computer-based attention test in a resource-limited setting, 41 Ecuadorian children between 2 and 4 years of age were evaluated once with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention adapted to eye-tracking instrumentation. To evaluate the validity of the ECVT, results were compared with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133, measured 3\u20134 times between 21 and 48 months of age. Results: ECVT measures were collected successfully for 97.6% of children (40/41), suggesting good field usability of the test in this resource-limited setting. An increase in 1 SD in child attention, as measured by the ECVT average fixation duration, was associated with a 7.9-point increase in the overall Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133 score (95% CI [1.5, 14.2], <em>p</em> = .015). Conclusions: A computer-based attention assessment in early childhood was usable in a resource-limited setting and predictive of a caregiver-reported screener of child neurodevelopment. The ECVT, therefore, can be used to assess the effects of early risk factors and resilience in brain/behavior development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index \u201cspeed\u201d potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination.

Results: There was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the <em>tau</em> parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD and among children with low working memory capacity (regardless of ADHD status). Variance in <em>tau</em> was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory.

Here, we determine whether familiarizing individuals with self-appraisal with daily memory testing for 7 days provide a more accurate estimate of cognitive functioning and mood. Method: Two hundred twenty-five participants (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> \u00b1 <em>SD</em>: 74.1 \u00b1 8.3 years; 66% female; median education 16.0 years) completed the online Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health, which included two associative memory tasks, for seven consecutive days. Each day, participants self-appraised their performance. At baseline, they completed various cognitive and mood measures. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between task performance and self-appraisal on Days 1 and 7 and used linear models to examine the relationship between self-appraisal scores and clinical measures. Results: Accuracy (Day 1: 0.44 \u00b1 0.12; Day 7: 0.81 \u00b1 0.16) and self-appraisal (Day 1: 0.36 \u00b1 0.15; Day 7: 0.70 \u00b1 0.21) increased, as did the association between accuracy and self-appraisal, Day 1: correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [0.09, 0.34], <em>p</em> = .001; Day 7: <em>r</em> = 0.69, 95% CI [0.62, 0.76], <em>p</em> < .001. Self-appraisal scores on Day 7, but not Day 1, showed significant relationships with in-clinic measures. Conclusions: Repeated remote cognitive assessments may help elucidate individuals\u2019 capacities to refine their self-perception of cognitive performance during multiday learning. The weak association between accuracy and test-na\u00efve self-appraisal warrants caution about using this metric cross-sectionally. Experienced self-appraisal could be especially relevant at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when subtle learning difficulties emerge and could improve our capacity to detect early meta-cognitive changes.

However, longitudinal data are limited, and conventional approaches do not account for biomarkers to exclude underlying Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, reducing sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive decline in preclinical AD. To address these limitations, this research provides robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms derived from Spanish individuals with nonpathological levels of AD biomarkers. Method: We analyzed 3-year follow-up data from 350 cognitively unimpaired individuals (Alzheimer\u2019s and Families+ cohort). A subset of 228 individuals with normal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242/40, phosphorylated-tau181, and total-tau biomarkers defined the robust reference group. Neuropsychological assessment encompassed the Trail Making Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Memory Binding Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013IV, Wechsler Memory Scale\u2013IV, Semantic Fluency Test, and Judgment of Line Orientation from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Using the Reliable Change Index and Standardized Regression-Based methods, robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms were derived from the reference group. Validation analysis assessed the sensitivity of robust versus conventional normative procedures. Results: Models, equations, percentiles, and cutoffs for identifying significant cognitive decline were provided. Robust norms showed modestly greater sensitivity in certain measures, particularly in episodic memory. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: Total Free Delayed Recall showed the most notable result at the 5th percentile in Reliable Change Index (\u03c7\u00b2 = 16.06, <em>p</em> = 6.15E-05). Conclusions: Robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms may improve the detection of subtle cognitive decline, modestly enhancing sensitivity at the lower ends of distributions.

    "title": "Posttraumatic stress symptomatology rather than mild traumatic brain injury is related to atypical early neural processing during cognitive control.",
    "content": "Objective: Many veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) report disruptions in cognition; however, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these cognitive difficulties are not well understood. It is also unknown whether PTSD symptomatology or past mTBIs uniquely impact functions important to adaptation such as cognitive control. Method: We examined event-related potentials elicited by a flanker task to evaluate brain responses during conflict monitoring in a sample of 192 U.S. military veterans with combat-zone experience and exposure to explosive blasts. Clinical assessments characterized diagnoses as well as the severity of PTSD symptoms and mTBI so that we could parse overlapping syndromes and directly contrast effects of the two conditions. Results: Across groups, participants performed worse on conflict trials (Incongruent distractors), particularly when preceded by a no-conflict (Congruent distractors) trial. We found that greater dysphoric PTSD symptomatology was related to a reduced early perceptual response (P1), while greater avoidance PTSD symptomatology predicted a larger early visual attention response (N1). Although late cognitive processes (N2, P3) were sensitive to cognitive control demands of the flanker task, posttraumatic symptomatology and mTBI severity were unrelated to them. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the Avoidance and Dysphoria domains of PTSD symptomatology may differentially relate to early neural functions of perception and visual attention rather than later cognitive responses. Rehabilitation and treatment of individuals with PTSD and mTBI may be most productive when focused on perceptual and attentional processing, which could improve cognitive control.

    "title": "Acquired crowding dyslexia: A peripheral reading deficit other than neglect dyslexia.",
    "content": "Objectives: Crowding refers to the phenomenon whereby small visual objects above the acuity threshold are detected but unrecognizable when surrounded by nearby stimuli. It affects reading in healthy individuals and can be enhanced in reading impairments. By increasing the interletter space, crowding decreases. Previous evidence on patients with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and peripheral dyslexia has shown a dissociation in sensitivity to spacing manipulation between those who mainly produced omissions and those characterized by substitutions in reading. Here, we wanted to verify the hypothesis that the reading impairment mainly characterized by substitutions is dissociated from USN, unlike the one characterized by omissions. Method: In a retrospective study, we collected 38 right-brain-damaged patients, 21 with USN. We analyzed the number and types of errors in reading single words and pseudowords, spaced and unspaced, comparing patients with and without USN. Results: USN patients showed significantly more omissions than patients without USN and increased omissions with letter spacing. Substitutions were more frequent in USN patients but did not increase with spacing. Performance of patients mainly characterized by substitutions revealed a reduction of errors with spaced pseudowords and a double dissociation from USN. Lesion overlap analysis suggested that the two deficits could depend on different components of visuospatial attention networks. Conclusions: We claim that proper neglect dyslexia is characterized by omission errors and has USN as a necessary mechanism, even if not sufficient. Conversely, acquired crowding dyslexia is a different reading deficit, characterized by substitutions due to an enhanced crowding phenomenon, independent of USN.

    "content": "Objective: Cannabis has become increasingly accessible to populations living with chronic health conditions such as HIV. Many people living with HIV are turning to cannabis for symptom relief despite the unclear risks to neurocognitive health. Our study sought to replicate and extend prior research by examining global and domain-specific neurocognitive performance between four groups stratified by use of cannabis (CB; CB+/CB\u2212) and HIV serostatus (HIV+/HIV\u2212). Method: Our demographically diverse community sample (<em>N</em> = 269) underwent exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the effects of cannabis use (CU) and HIV on neurocognition. We explored between-group comparisons of neurocognitive performance, probability of neurocognitive impairment, and interactive effects of CU/HIV serostatus. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed nonsignificant differences in global or domain-specific neurocognitive performance. However, the CB+/HIV+ group was three times (99% CI [1.18, 9.57]) more likely to be labeled with a memory impairment compared to the control (CB-/HIV\u2212), and the CB+/HIV\u2212 group was twice (99% CI [.14, 7.47]) as likely to be labeled with an executive functioning impairment compared to the control. We also identified an interactive effect between the past 30-day CU and HIV serostatus for global (<em>b</em> = \u2212.026, 99% CI [\u2212.04, \u2212.01]) and motor (<em>b</em> = \u2212.052, 99% CI [\u2212.07, \u2212.03]) neurocognitive performance. Findings support a nuanced relationship between CU and HIV, which may partly explain mixed literature. Conclusions: Although we conclude that recent and heavy CU poses risk of neurocognitive decline among people living with HIVs, this effect is modest. Physicians and patients must weigh a possible decrease in global and motor neurocognition against the severity of symptoms being treated.

    "content": "There are dream metaphors that express waking-life experiences indirectly. Animals in dreams have been speculated to be related to dream metaphors. Here, we explored if there was any relationship between waking-life experiences related to elder relatives with both dreaming about elder relatives and dreaming about animals. For 1 day, 270 participants recorded waking-life experiences in daily diaries before sleeping and recorded their dreams upon waking. Two external judges rated if there was any content related to elder relatives or animals in both daily diaries and dreams. The most three frequent animals in dreams were dogs, cats, and snakes, or fishes, or birds. The frequency of waking-life experiences related to elder relatives was correlated with both the frequency of dreaming about elder relatives and the frequency of dreaming about animals. Yet, the latter two variables were not correlated with each other. The results supported the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. In addition, the results may suggest that some animals in dreams represented elder relatives in waking life metaphorically. Moreover, the results may support Carl Jung\u2019s idea that the image of animals in dreams may be a symbol of parents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

A questionnaire was administered to 384 participants (mean age = 20.63 years, SD = 1.21; 205 females, 179 males), revealing that over half of them reported having sexual dreams, with a higher prevalence among males. The sexual dream group scored higher than the nonsexual dream group on aggressiveness, neuroticism, and sensation seeking. Furthermore, negative emotions, sensation seeking, activity, and extraversion play an important role in the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences among sexual dreamers.

The present, brief report is a post hoc analysis of previously unanalyzed items from two studies of bereaved individuals. One study focused on loss following the death of a romantic partner (n = 268) and the other following the death of a dog or cat (n = 199). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had dreamed of the deceased or had a waking experience of seeing, hearing, or feeling the touch of the deceased in the prior month. Consistent with prior research, a substantial portion of each sample (50.7% of the partner loss participants and 32.2% of the pet loss) reported at least one waking experience of seeing, hearing, and/or feeling the deceased. When dreaming of the deceased and/or having a waking experience of the deceased were combined, it was found to be 82.5% for partner loss and 68.2% for pet loss. Furthermore, dreaming about the deceased was related to having such waking experiences. These preliminary, exploratory findings contribute to the growing recognition that we need more research and theory into the function of such experiences for the bereaved and for those facing end of life.

    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "title": "Deep brain stimulation of nucleus basalis of meynert: Effect of stimulation mode and duration on learning in rat model of dementia.",
    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "Cross-region neuron co-firing mediated by ripple oscillations supports distributed working memory representations.",
    "content": "High-frequency (~90Hz) ripple oscillations may promote integrative processing in mammalian brains. Previous work has demonstrated that the co-occurrence of these ripple oscillations is associated with enhanced temporal binding of neural activity between human cortical neurons separated by up to 12mm. However, it remains unclear whether co-ripple facilitation of neuronal coupling supports cognitive processing, or if it occurs at greater distances. Here, we analyze intracranial recordings from patients implanted with microwire electrodes in the hippocampus, amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and pre-supplementary motor area, bilaterally, during a working memory task. We demonstrate that ripple oscillations significantly increase in all recorded regions, during encoding, maintenance and retrieval. Furthermore, co-occurrence of ripples increases between brain regions, associated with ~30% increases in cross-region co-firing, both without decrement over distances up to 220 mm. These increases in cross-regional co-rippling and associated co-firing scale with memory load during maintenance and retrieval. Critically, during retrieval, co-ripples promote the reinstatement of the stimulus-specific long-distance co-firing patterns observed during encoding, especially during rapid recognition. Our findings reveal that ripple oscillations orchestrate long-range neural communication that supports distributed neural representations during human cognition.",

    "title": "TBK1 activity regulates the directionality of axonal transport of signalling endosomes",
    "content": "The polarised and complex morphology of neurons pose massive challenges for efficient cargo delivery between the axon and soma, a process termed axonal transport. We have previously shown that the retrograde axonal transport of pro-survival, neurotrophic signalling endosomes relies on Rab7 in motor neurons, and that their trafficking is impaired in the early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. Here, we report the effect of Rab7 phosphorylation on the transport of these signalling endosomes. We show that the ALS-linked kinase TBK1 phosphorylates Rab7 at S72 in neurons, altering its binding to cytoplasmic dynein adaptors. Accordingly, both TBK1 knockdown and the expression of a loss-of-function Rab7 mutant (S72E) induce aberrant bidirectional movement of signalling endosomes without modifying neuronal polarity or endosomal sorting. This alteration is specific for signalling endosomes, as axonal transport of lysosomes and mitochondria remain unaffected. We have therefore discovered a new TBK1 function that ensures the unidirectional transport of signalling endosomes, suggesting that reduced TBK1 activity determines retrograde transport dysfunctions and long-range signalling impairments.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

While near heterophoria shifted towards esophoria, participants' ability to counteract this was also diminished by a reduction in NFV. This suggests that the near heterophoria and fusional reserves of children using 0.05% atropine for myopia control should be monitored closely.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

The library is Python based and makes use of <a href=\"https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">PyVisa </a>library for communction with electronic eqipment supporting <a href=\"https://www.ivifoundation.org/About-IVI/scpi.html\">SCPI </a>standard.</p> <p>The library also includes some <a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html\">pytest-fixtures</a> which makes it nice to use in automated testing environment.</p> <p>Below I share summary of the hardware used and developed python library as well as some example results for an automated DC-DC converter measurements. You can find all the details in my <a href=\"https://ak-experiments.blogspot.com/2025/09/automating-power-supply-measurements.html\">blog post</a></p> <p><strong>Hardware:</strong></p> <p>I had access to the following instruments:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.keysight.com/us/en/support/U3606B/multimeter-dc-power-supply.html\">Keysight U3606B</a>: Combination of a 5.5 digit digital multimeter and 30-W power supply in a single unit<br /> <a href=\"https://www.keysight.com/us/en/products/source-measure-units-smu/u2722a-u2723a-usb-modular-source-measure-units-smu.html\">Keysight U2723A:</a> Modular source measure unit (SMU) Four-quadrant operation (\u00b1 120 mA/\u00b1 20 V)</p> <p><strong>Software:</strong></p> <p>The developd library contain wrapper classes that implement the control and measurement functions of the above instruments.</p> <p>The exposed functions by the SCPI interface are normally documented in the programming manuals of the equipment published online. So it was just a matter of going through the manuals to get the required <a href=\"https://www.ivifoundation.org/About-IVI/scpi.html\">SCPI</a> commands / queries for a given instrument function and then sending it over to the instrument using <a href=\"https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">PyVisa</a> write and query functions.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong></p> <p>A classical example application with a power supply and source measure unit is to evaluate the efficiency of DC-DC conversion for a given system.

    "content": "BackgroundC-tactile (CT) afferents preferentially activate in response to slow caress-like touch, evoking a diffuse pleasant sensation and promoting autonomic regulation. According to Braak's classic model, the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) only affects somatosensory cortices in advanced disease stages; however, the processing of complex sensory stimuli, such as CT-mediated Affective Touch, may be impacted in earlier phases.ObjectiveThe present study aimed to assess the...",
