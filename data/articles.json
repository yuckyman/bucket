    "content": "The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas provides gene expression data for over 20,000 genes and has been extensively used in neuroscience. However, it is constrained by a resolution of 200 {micro}m3. We improved this to 25 {micro}m3 for 4,083 genes by re-registering 401,660 sections to atlas space. From this, we produced an atlas with regions defined by shared molecular signatures and built an interactive online platform allowing exploration of gene expression patterns.",

    "title": "Phosphatidylserine exposure by developing astrocytes initiates microglia-mediated developmental cell death",
    "content": "Developmental cell death is classically attributed to apoptosis, yet in mammalian retina, large numbers of developing astrocytes die non-apoptotically during a defined developmental window. Astrocyte death is important for patterning a cellular template that guides angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that healthy developing astrocytes initiate their own elimination by recruiting microglia via regulated exposure of the membrane lipid phosphatidylserine. Experimentally increasing phosphatidylserine exposure in astrocytes, but not neurons, accelerates their removal by microglia without changing how many astrocytes ultimately survive. This acceleration causes profound vascular defects resembling pathological features of retinopathy of prematurity. Genetic disruption of MFGE8, a phosphatidylserine-binding protein, suppresses microglia-mediated astrocyte killing and prevents vascular pathology despite continued phosphatidylserine exposure. This mechanism extends beyond the retina, because phosphatidylserine also initiates astrocyte death in developing cerebral cortex. Together, these findings identify phosphatidylserine exposure as a developmental signal that times microglia-mediated astrocyte elimination, with essential consequences for neurovascular development.",

    "title": "Preferential vulnerability of cortical GABAergic interneurons to Nalcn deficiency",
    "content": "Neuronal resting membrane potential (RMP) reflects the balance of leak conductances and varies systematically across cortical cell types. Many GABAergic interneurons exhibit more depolarized RMPs than neighbouring excitatory neurons, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these systematic differences in intrinsic excitability remain incompletely defined. The sodium leak channel non-selective (NALCN) mediates a major fraction of basal sodium conductance and cause neurodevelopmental syndromes characterized by developmental delay and cognitive impairment. Here we define NALCN contribution to cortical circuit development and function with cell-type precision. Using Nalcn-GFP reporter line, we map Nalcn expression across cortical types revealing enrichment in GABAergic hippocampal interneurons relative to hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Using conditional mouse models, we selectively deleted Nalcn in cortical glutamatergic lineages or forebrain GABAergic cells from early embryogenesis. Electrophysiological analysis show that developmental loss of Nalcn preferentially reduces intrinsic excitability across GABAergic interneuron subtypes while sparing pyramidal neurons. To understand the impact of a depolarized GABAergic RMP on brain function, we assessed the behavioral performance of Nalcn-deficient mice that revealed persistent deficits in contextual adaptation and spatial short-term memory. These findings reveal a neuron type-specific function of NALCN in the cerebral cortex and position NALCN as a crucial ion channel regulating basal excitability of GABAergic inhibitory circuits and cortical circuit function.",

    "title": "Axonal theta oscillations evoke bursting in target hippocampal subregions",
    "content": "Local field potentials (LFPs) measured in the extracellular matrix of the brain are postulated to arise from the integration of synaptic ionic currents and spread by volume conduction. However, there is a lack of consensus on whether these spatiotemporal voltage gradients are just an epiphenomenon of spiking or if the LFPs play a functional role in information processing. To examine a potential functional role of LFPs in information processing, we developed a microfluidic device that allows neurons from the hippocampal formation to self-wire through microfluidic channels, effectively isolating the activity of single axons between subregions of the network. We recorded spontaneous theta-band activity (4-10 Hz) in these axons whose power spectra were independent of simultaneous spiking activity. A sparse set of axons from the CA3 into the CA1 had the highest theta amplitudes. Source neurons for the axonal theta were identified through cross correlation. Functionally, sparse axonal theta phase and amplitude correlated with target subregional spiking and more strongly with burst length. These results suggest that theta voltage oscillations in axons may contribute to activation of slow voltage-gated calcium channels to drive stronger synaptic release of transmitter to coordinate hippocampal activity between subregions. We propose that theta oscillations are controlled by specific ion channels distinct from those that generate spikes, a multiplex coding mechanism for inter-regional communication with implications for routing, executive control, disease states and artificial neural networks.",

    "title": "Coordinated pre- and postsynaptic protein dynamics underlie rapid Sema4D-mediated inhibitory synapse assembly",
    "content": "In the mammalian hippocampus, synapses are either excitatory or inhibitory as defined by the presynaptic neurotransmitter (glutamate or GABA, respectively) and the specific ligand-gated ion channel receptors localized to the postsynaptic specialization. While numerous studies explore the formation of excitatory synapses, the process of inhibitory synapse formation is less understood. Using both loss- and gain-of-function approaches, our lab previously identified the class 4 Semaphorin Sema4D as a key regulator of inhibitory synaptogenesis. Here, using recombinant Sema4D protein as a tool to rapidly induce GABAergic synapse formation in cultured hippocampal neurons, we employ two-channel live imaging to identify changes to pre- and postsynaptic protein dynamics during inhibitory synapse formation. We find that Sema4D treatment promotes the mobility of presynaptic GAD65 protein assemblies while having a negligible effect on the behavior of the postsynaptic gephyrin scaffold, leading to increased colocalization of these proteins. In addition, Sema4D treatment promotes the recruitment of GABAAR{gamma}2 subunits to immature gephyrin scaffolds, suggesting that Sema4D primes these scaffolds for receptor recruitment. Surprisingly, we observe new colocalization events between existing gephyrin and GABAAR puncta, suggesting that clustering of either the gephyrin scaffold or the GABAAR is sufficient to nucleate assembly of the postsynaptic specialization. Overall our results support a model in which Sema4D signaling coordinates dynamic changes in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments to assemble inhibitory synapses on rapid timescales.",

It\u2019s an attempt to explain how Python\u2019s typing system behaves <em>as a system</em> \u2014 how inference, narrowing, boundaries, and async typing interact, and how typing can be used as a way of reasoning about code rather than just silencing linters.</p> <p>It\u2019s long, but modular; you can drop into any section. The main chunks are:</p> <ul> <li>What Python typing is (and is not) good at</li> <li>How checkers resolve ambiguity and refine types (and why inference fails)</li> <li>Typing data at boundaries (TypedDict vs parsing)</li> <li>Structural typing, guards, match, and resolution</li> <li>Async typing and control flow</li> <li>Generics (TypeVar, ParamSpec, higher-order functions)</li> <li>Architectural patterns and tradeoffs</li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019ve ever felt that typing \u201cmostly works but feels opaque,\u201d this is aimed at that gap.</p> <p>If you notice errors, confusing explanations, or places where it breaks down in real usage, I\u2019d appreciate hearing about it \u2014 even partial or section-level feedback helps.</p> <p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/JBogEsq/python_type_hinting_guide\">https://github.com/JBogEsq/python_type_hinting_guide</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JoelBEsq\"> /u/JoelBEsq </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjkwnx/understanding_pythons_typing_system_draft_guide/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjkwnx/understanding_pythons_typing_system_draft_guide/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

    "title": "Brain Age in Conduct Disorder: A Mega-Analysis of the ENIGMA Antisocial Behavior Working Group",
    "content": "Conduct disorder (CD) is the leading global cause of mental health burden in children and adolescents and has recently been hypothesized to be a neurodevelopmental disorder. Although prior research has identified neuroanatomical differences associated with CD, it remains unclear whether these differences reflect atypical brain development. Here, we investigated the difference between an individual's brain age and chronological age as a proxy for variations in brain maturation. Using a pretrained model, we estimated brain age from structural neuroimaging data obtained from 1,119 youth with CD and 1,183 typically developing controls across 14 international cohorts participating in the ENIGMA-Antisocial Behavior Working Group. Youth with CD exhibited a statistically robust but small acceleration in brain age compared to typically developing youth (around 0.50 years), which was restricted to the adolescence-onset subtype of the disorder. Our large-scale, coordinated analysis provides the first evidence of accelerated neurodevelopment as a potential mechanism underlying CD.",

    "title": "Organization, Neuronal Composition, and Dynamics of Neuronal Ensembles in the Songbird Auditory Forebrain",
    "content": "Auditory learning is a key component of vocal learning and communication. Neurons involved in auditory learning are typically examined as single encoders, but there is increasing evidence that the coincident activity of groups of neurons, or ensembles, is important for the processing and transmission of sensory information. In songbirds, a forebrain region analogous to mammalian secondary auditory cortex, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), is crucial for representing and learning auditory signals. In the awake state, NCM neurons exhibit stimulus-specific adaptation in response to repeated presentation of song stimuli, considered a form of auditory working memory. Yet, how complex stimuli like song are encoded by networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is essentially unknown. Using in-vivo single-unit electrophysiology, we systematically unveiled neuronal ensembles that operate at high temporal precision (< 10 ms) across the NCM of awake zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Our data show that multiple ensembles are concurrently activated by song with high temporal precision, and that their neuronal composition is heterogeneous, topographically proximate, and biased towards excitatory members. NCM ensembles adapt to song playback and, notably, become more stimulus selective over tens of minutes, accompanied by fast remodeling (membership gain and/or loss) during adaptation. Altogether, our results suggest that song representations in the forebrain can be conveyed by multiple, dynamic network ensembles in parallel. These findings advance our knowledge of the composition, dynamics, and neuronal network reorganization of ensembles as complex sensory stimuli become increasingly familiar.",

    "title": "Chemogenetic activation induces persistent transcriptomic remodeling and functional plasticity in cultured astrocytes",
    "content": "Astrocytes are essential regulators of neuronal function and brain homeostasis. Recent methodological advances have increasingly revealed their active roles through precise manipulation of astrocyte function in the brain. While chemogenetic strategies, such as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), have been widely used to recapitulate endogenous G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling and selectively modulate astrocyte activity, the molecular mechanisms accompanying DREADD activation remain incompletely understood. Here, we characterized the transcriptional responses of cultured cortical astrocytes and found that DREADD activation induces profound changes in astrocytic gene expression profiles. Activation of Gi-, Gq-, and Gs-coupled DREADDs elicited distinct transcriptomic responses. Transcription factor activity profiling further revealed that each DREADD subtype selectively modulates a distinct set of transcription factors that collectively shape astrocytic transcriptomic responses, thereby indicating subtype-specific transcriptional mechanisms. Importantly, DREADD activation induced persistent changes in the astrocytic transcriptome that remained detectable even three days after stimulation. These transcriptomic alterations were associated with sustained changes in astrocytic calcium responses to extracellular ATP, indicating plastic changes in astrocytic physiological function. Together, these findings provide a molecular framework for interpreting astrocytic DREADD manipulations and reveal a mechanistic basis for functional plasticity and heterogeneity of astrocytes.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

    "title": "Abnormal functional activity in the cerebellar crus can distinguish patients with migraine with comorbid insomnia",
    "content": "BackgroundMigraine is a prevalent neurological disorder that is frequently observed in clinical practice and is commonly comorbid with insomnia. Insomnia can exacerbate and precipitate migraine attacks, with both conditions exerting a reciprocal influence on one another. The cerebellar crus is significantly associated with the pathophysiology of migraine and insomnia. The relationship between cerebellar crus functional alterations and migraine-associated insomnia remains unclear. This study utilizes resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to examine functional alterations in the cerebellar crus of patients with migraine and concurrent insomnia.MethodsParticipants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subsequently, the disparity in amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) values among groups was analyzed, followed by functional connectivity (FC) investigations employing the cerebellum crus as seed regions.ResultsMigraine patients frequently experience neuropsychological disorders and insomnia, which are interconnected. Both migraine with insomnia (MwI) and migraine without insomnia (MwoI) groups demonstrated elevated amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the left Crus I and II compared to the healthy controls (HC) group, with the MwI group exhibiting more pronounced alterations. Additionally, both patient groups showed decreased FC between the left Crus I and the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) relative to the HC group. The MwoI group showed significantly lower FC compared to both the HC and MwI groups. A significant negative correlation was observed between ALFF in the left Crus I/II and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores in the MwoI group. Conversely, in the combined migraine cohort, FC between the left Crus I and the right MTG/ITG showed a positive correlation with PSQI scores.ConclusionThis study identified a correlation between aberrant functional activity in the left Crus I/II and migraine comorbidity with insomnia. These findings provide fresh perspectives on the neural mechanisms underlying the migraine-insomnia relationship, thereby facilitating the identification of potential neuroimaging biomarkers and the exploration of targeted interventions for this patient subgroup.",

    "title": "The effects of electrical stimulation on neurons and glia of the central nervous system",
    "content": "Objective. This review paper focuses on how both direct current (DC) stimulation and alternating current (AC) stimulation affects the central nervous system\u2019s (CNSs) cells and its potential as a neurotherapeutic. Furthermore, addressing the promise of combinatorial approaches that utilize other treatments alongside electrical stimulation (ES) and how ES has shaped clinical approaches as a new rehabilitation treatment. Approach. Authors conducted this review to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation; 124 manuscripts were identified through Google Scholar for insights into ES effects on neurons and glia in both in vitro and in vivo models. Main results. The review summarizes findings from DC and AC stimulation paradigms applied to in vitro or in vivo preclinical models and summarizes the promise of ES when applied clinically. Generally, DC stimulation promotes axonal extension towards the cathode, while axons retract at the anode, limiting regeneration. AC stimulation alternates electrode polarity, enabling axonal extension in both directions. The intensity and duration of ES significantly affects the extent of neurite outgrowth. For astrocytes and microglia, ES\u2014whether AC or DC\u2014downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting A2 or M2 reactive states conducive to regeneration, respectively. Regarding oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), both DC and AC stimulation enhance OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes, increasing myelin content and supporting axonal myelination. ES, when combined with stem cell treatments, drug delivery approaches, or with electroactive biomaterials, facilitate greater efficacy of these approaches. Clinically, short-single sessions of ES have shown long-term improvement. More specifically, preliminary efforts have been implemented to restore gait, hand tremors, and speech in spinal cord injuries, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and stroke patients, respectively. Significance. ES is an evolving neurotherapeutic strategy for CNS related disease or injuries. Understanding how ES modulates neurons and glia is critical for optimizing its application in the clinic.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot.

As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "content": "Pupil diameter provides a powerful, non-invasive biomarker of brain state, correlating with arousal, attention, cognitive processing, and level of consciousness. Despite its widespread use, pupillometry remains limited by software tools that lack scalability, robustness, and flexibility across experimental conditions. Here we introduce Pupil-DLC, an open-source, DeepLabCut-based pipeline for scalable, markerless tracking of pupil dynamics. Pupil-DLC is trained on 19,500 manually annotated frames selected from over 130 pupil videos of head-fixed mice spanning wakefulness to diverse drug-induced states of consciousness, including psychedelics, and anesthesia. The pipeline robustly captures state-dependent pupil dynamics, achieving high agreement with human-annotated ground truth data and outperforming an established automated method in both accuracy and detection reliability, while maintaining computational efficiency. Pupil-DLC incorporates a dual-model framework comprising a General Model (GM) for high-throughput analysis of infra-red recorded mice pupils and an Individual Model (IM) tailored for session-specific optimization, as well as interpretable confidence metrics that enable principled trade-offs between accuracy and data retention. Notably, the model generalizes, without retraining, to human infrared pupil recordings, supporting cross-species pupillometry. Pupil-DLC provides a flexible, reproducible platform for quantifying pupil-linked brain state dynamics across diverse experimental paradigms and species.",

    "title": "Modelling ferroptosis in a human microglial line by sequential exposure to iron and GPX4 inhibition",
    "content": "Excessive iron accumulation is a pathological feature of several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and a growing body of evidence suggests that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death (RCD) driven by lipid peroxidation, is implicated in their pathogenesis. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, buffer iron overload but become susceptible to ferroptotic death, exacerbating neuroinflammation and neuronal loss. To uncover the molecular events leading to microglial ferroptosis, we established a human microglial ferroptosis model using the HMC3 cell line. This model recapitulates core features of ferroptosis, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxidation of lipids at the membrane, both rescued by Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). We used this model to perform integrated multi-omics profiling and identified significant dysregulation in lipid species, notably an accumulation of sterols, including oxysterols such as the 7-oxo-cholesterol, alongside the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) characteristic of ferroptosis. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses corroborated these findings, revealing the upregulation of genes and proteins involved in the mevalonate pathway and cholesterol metabolism. Importantly, the increased expression of some of these key metabolic genes was also reversed by Fer-1 treatment, indicating their role in a pre-ferroptotic signature. Our model provides a novel platform for investigating early molecular events in microglia ferroptosis. Integrating these findings into future investigations could uncover new protective mechanisms against microglia ferroptosis at the crossroad between ROS level mitigation and sterol metabolism.",

    "title": "Case Report: Effective management of a Meige syndrome patient with subthalamic stimulation-induced dyskinesia through timed stimulation programming of different contacts",
    "content": "IntroductionMeige syndrome is a rare adult-onset segmental dystonia characterized by blepharospasms and oromandibular dystonia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment, but it can lead to stimulation-induced dyskinesia (SID) in some patients. Refractory SID in Meige syndrome after STN-DBS is clinically challenging. We report a case of a Meige syndrome patient who developed refractory SID following STN-DBS and was successfully managed using a novel timed-stimulation programming strategy employing different contacts.Case descriptionA 47-year-old female with a two-year history of Meige syndrome developed refractory SID after the treatment of STN-DBS. Various programming strategies were attempted, including monopolar stimulation, interleaved stimulation, bipolar stimulation et al., but none achieved a balance between symptom control and SID. A novel approach involving timed alternation between ventral contacts (contacts 3 and 7) and dorsal contacts (contacts 4 and 8) was implemented. The stimulation was gradually programmed, the duration of ventral stimulation was increased while decreasing dorsal stimulation. Eventually, the patient achieved significant symptom improvement without SID. The reconstruction of the volume of tissue activated (VTA) revealed that this stimulation strategy likely modulates the neural circuits of pallidothalamic fibers (PTF) to suppress SID.ConclusionThis case demonstrates that this noval timed stimulation programming can effectively manage refractory SID in Meige syndrome patients, offering a viable alternative when conventional methods fail. The findings suggest that PTF stimulation plays a key role in SID suppression, and this strategy warrants further investigation in larger cohorts.",

    "content": "Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome (BRPS, OMIM #615485) is a rare, heterogeneous autosomal dominant genetic disease that is mainly characterized by intellectual disability (ID) of varying degrees, developmental delay (DD), language impairments, failure to thrive, behavioral issues, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and distinctive craniofacial features. It is caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in the additional sex combs-like 3 (ASXL3, OMIM #615115) gene. In this study, four Chinese patients were diagnosed with BRPS caused by ASXL3 variants through whole exome sequencing. We detected two novel and two previously reported variants of the ASXL3 gene (NM_030632.3) in these 4 unrelated Chinese patients: two novel variants, namely, c.1276del (p.Val426*) and c.3750del (p.Glu1251Asnfs*5), and two recurrent variants, namely, c.4330C>T (p.Arg1444*) and c.4336_4337delAG (p.Arg1446fs*2). All four patients had a clinical profile similar to that associated with BRPS. Compared with previously reported cases of BRPS, these patients exhibited novel complications, including long eyelashes, congenital laryngeal cartilage hypoplasia and dextrocardia. These findings broaden our understanding of the mutational and clinical spectrum of BRPS, emphasizing the importance of long-term monitoring and vigilance regarding potential complications, such as cardiac abnormalities, in BRPS patients.",

While MIA-induced changes in the gut bacterial communities of offspring and their metabolites have been linked to behavioral abnormalities, the effects of MIA on the gut fungal communities and their mycotoxin-associated metabolites in offspring remain poorly characterized.MethodsIn this study, MIA was modeled in pregnant rats through intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg Poly I:C on gestational day 15. The model\u2019s efficacy was validated using behavioral assessments, including the open-field test, elevated plus maze, and Morris water maze. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis were employed to detect the alterations of gut fungal microbiota and mycotoxin levels.ResultsPoly I:C-exposed offspring exhibited increased anxiety and cognitive deficits. Meanwhile, Poly I:C induces sex-related differences in gut fungal communities and mycotoxin levels in juvenile offspring rats. Several fungal genera and mycotoxins were significantly correlated with variations in anxiety-like behaviors and spatial learning performance.DiscussionOur findings suggest that MIA-induced behavioral deficits in offspring are accompanied by sex-specific disruptions in gut fungal composition and mycotoxin metabolism, which highlights the need for further intervention studies to establish causality and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of gut fungi and mycotoxins in NDDs.",

    "title": "Cortical excitability and brain function in patients with insomnia: a pilot transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional near-infrared spectroscopy study",
    "content": "BackgroundInsomnia significantly impairs well-being, cognitive function, and social functioning, yet subjective psychological assessments often yield equivocal results regarding the extent of this impairment. Neural function may underlie this discrepancy and offer a more precise foundation for guiding treatment. This study therefore employed non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate cortical excitability and brain activity patterns in patients with short-term insomnia disorder (SID) and chronic insomnia disorder (CID), aiming to identify associated neural function changes.MethodsWe recruited 30 patients with SID and 30 with CID. For all participants, cortical excitability was assessed by measuring the resting motor threshold (RMT) via single-pulse TMS. fNIRS was utilized to measure the concentrations of oxy-hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) and functional connectivity in the cerebral cortex during a verbal fluency task (VFT).ResultsOur study revealed that patients with SID had significantly lower RMT and higher cortical activation in the hemodynamic responses of Oxy-Hb in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the right temporal lobe (TL) than CID patients during the 60\u202fs task period. The CID group showed significantly lower average inter-channel connectivity strength compared to the SID group. Moreover, the CID group exhibited significantly lower connectivity from the right DLPFC to the left DLPFC and the left mPFC compared to the SID group. For the SID patient group, we found that the RMT was negatively correlated with mean Oxy-Hb changes in the left mPFC. Conversely, functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and TL showed a positive correlation with RMT. Furthermore, diminished connectivity between the left TL and mPFC was associated with elevated cortical excitability.ConclusionPatients with CID demonstrated lower cortical excitability, decreased brain activity, and reduced task-related functional connectivity relative to the SID group. This finding indicates distinct neurological profiles between short-term and chronic insomnia, a distinction that will be critical for tailoring effective neuromodulatory interventions.",

    "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
    "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

    "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

    "title": "A pretrained foundation model for headache disorders based on magnetoencephalography",
    "content": "Objective. Foundation models have demonstrated transformative potential in medical artificial intelligence but remain underexplored in functional neuroimaging, particularly magnetoencephalography (MEG). This study aims to develop a domain-specific, self-supervised MEG clinical foundation model tailored for headache disorders to address the challenges of high-dimensional data and limited labeled datasets in clinical research. Approach. We developed a transformer-based model pretrained on a large-scale dataset comprising multi-state MEG recordings (resting-state, auditory, and somatosensory stimulation) from 416 participants (362 headache patients and 54 healthy controls). The model utilized a self-supervised masked-signal reconstruction strategy to learn latent spatiotemporal representations of neural activity. We evaluated the model\u2019s performance through signal reconstruction, visualization of attention weights, and downstream classification tasks comparing model-derived features against original MEG signals for migraine diagnosis. Main results. The pretrained model successfully reconstructed both continuous MEG signals and stimulus-specific evoked responses, effectively capturing intrinsic spatiotemporal brain dynamics. Visualization of the model\u2019s attention weights demonstrated spatial alignment with corresponding sensory brain regions, confirming its neurophysiological interpretability. Furthermore, classifiers trained on features extracted from the pretrained model significantly outperformed those using original MEG signals in identifying migraine patients, revealing distinct neural response patterns. Significance. This study introduces a scalable, data-efficient framework for clinical MEG analysis that significantly reduces reliance on manual feature extraction and labeled data. It demonstrates the efficacy of foundation models in decoding complex neural dynamics, offering promising implications for understanding neuropathology and facilitating precision diagnostics in neurology.",

    "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

    "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

    "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

Although prior research has demonstrated the utility of patient-generated data in mental healthcare, significant challenges remain in effectively presenting these data streams along with clinical data (e.g., clinical notes) for clinical decision-making. Through co-design sessions with five clinicians, we propose MIND, a large language model-powered dashboard designed to present clinically relevant multimodal data insights for mental healthcare. MIND presents multimodal insights through narrative text, complemented by charts communicating underlying data. Our user study (N=16) demonstrates that clinicians perceive MIND as a significant improvement over baseline methods, reporting improved performance to reveal hidden and clinically relevant data insights (p<.001) and support their decision-making (p=.004). Grounded in the study results, we discuss future research opportunities to integrate data narratives in broader clinical practices.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.14639v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective collaboration between designers and users is important for fashion design, which can increase the user acceptance of fashion products and thereby create value. However, it remains an enduring challenge, as traditional designer-centric approaches restrict meaningful user participation, while user-driven methods demand design proficiency, often marginalizing professional creative judgment. Current co-design practices, including workshops and AI-assisted frameworks, struggle with low user engagement, inefficient preference collection, and difficulties in balancing user feedback with design considerations. To address these challenges, we conducted a formative study with designers and users experienced in co-design (N=7), identifying critical challenges for current collaboration between designers and users in the co-design process, and their requirements. Informed by these insights, we introduce DesignBridge, a multi-platform AI-enhanced interactive system that bridges designer expertise and user preferences through three stages: (1) Initial Design Framing, where designers define initial concepts. (2) Preference Expression Collection, where users intuitively articulate preferences via interactive tools. (3) Preference-Integrated Design, where designers use AI-assisted analytics to integrate feedback into cohesive designs. A user study demonstrates that DesignBridge significantly enhances user preference collection and analysis, enabling designers to integrate diverse preferences with professional expertise.",

This paper investigates how source transparency design shapes interactive information seeking, trust, and critical engagement. We conducted a controlled between-subjects experiment (N=372) comparing four source presentation interfaces - Collapsible, Hover Card, Footer, and Aligned Sidebar - varying in visibility and accessibility. Using fine-grained behavioral analysis and automated critical thinking assessment, we found that interface design fundamentally alters exploration strategies and evidence integration. While the Hover Card interface facilitated seamless, on-demand verification during the task, the Aligned Sidebar uniquely mitigated the negative effects of information overload: as citation density increased, Sidebar users demonstrated significantly higher critical thinking and synthesis scores compared to other conditions. Our results highlight a trade-off between designs that support workflow fluency and those that enforce reflective verification, offering practical implications for designing adaptive and responsible conversational AI that fosters critical engagement with AI generated content.",

To explore a complementary approach that prioritizes self-reflection, we design KRIYA, an AI wellbeing companion that supports co-interpretive engagement with personal wellbeing data. KRIYA aims to collaborate with users to explore questions, explanations, and future scenarios through features such as Comfort Zone, Detective Mode, and What-If Planning. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 college students interacting with a KRIYA prototype using hypothetical data. Our findings show that through KRIYA interaction, users framed engaging with wellbeing data as interpretation rather than performance, experienced reflection as supportive or pressuring depending on emotional framing, and developed trust through transparency. We discuss design implications for AI companions that support curiosity, self-compassion, and reflective sensemaking of personal health data.",

However, robots remain largely black boxes, offering users little insight into their evolving capabilities and limitations. To address this gap, we present explainable object-oriented HRI (X-OOHRI), an augmented reality (AR) interface that conveys robot action possibilities and constraints through visual signifiers, radial menus, color coding, and explanation tags. Our system encodes object properties and robot limits into object-oriented structures using a vision-language model, allowing explanation generation on the fly and direct manipulation of virtual twins spatially aligned within a simulated environment. We integrate the end-to-end pipeline with a physical robot and showcase diverse use cases ranging from low-level pick-and-place to high-level instructions. Finally, we evaluate X-OOHRI through a user study and find that participants effectively issue object-oriented commands, develop accurate mental models of robot limitations, and engage in mixed-initiative resolution.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.14566v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Supply chains (SCs), complex networks spanning from raw material acquisition to product delivery, with enterprises as interconnected nodes, play a pivotal role in organizational success. However, optimizing SCs remains challenging, particularly in partner selection, a key bottleneck shaped by competitive and cooperative dynamics. This challenge constitutes a multi-objective dynamic game requiring a synergistic integration of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making and Game Theory. Traditional approaches, grounded in mathematical simplifications and managerial heuristics, fail to capture real-world intricacies and risk introducing subjective biases. Multi-agent simulation offers promise, but prior research has largely relied on fixed, uniform agent logic, limiting practical applicability. Recent advances in LLMs create opportunities to represent complex SC requirements and hybrid game logic. However, challenges persist in modeling dynamic SC relationships, ensuring interpretability, and balancing agent autonomy with expert control. We present SCSimulator, a visual analytics framework that integrates LLM-driven MAS with human-in-the-loop collaboration for SC partner selection. It simulates SC evolution via adaptive network structures and enterprise behaviors, which are visualized via interpretable interfaces. By combining CoT reasoning with XAI techniques, it generates multi-faceted, transparent explanations of decision trade-offs. Users can iteratively adjust simulation settings to explore outcomes aligned with their expectations and strategic priorities. Developed through iterative co-design with SC experts and industry managers, SCSimulator serves as a proof-of-concept, offering methodological contributions and practical insights for future research on SC decision-making and interactive AI-driven analytics. Usage scenarios and a user study demonstrate the system's effectiveness and usability.",

However, as visual complexity increases, perceptual performance declines, making it more difficult to detect changes quickly and accurately. This study examines how visual features, known for facilitating preattentive processing, impact a change detection task in immersive 3D environments, with a focus on visual complexity, object attributes, and spatial proximity. Our results demonstrate that preattentive processing enhances change detection, particularly when the altered object is spatially isolated and not perceptually grouped with similar surrounding objects. Changes to isolated objects were detected more reliably, suggesting that perceptual isolation reduces cognitive load and draws more attention. Conversely, when a changed object was surrounded by visually similar elements, participants were less likely to detect the change, indicating that perceptual grouping hinders individual object recognition in complex scenes. These results provide guidelines for designing VR applications that strategically utilize spatial isolation and visual features to improve the user experience.",

Prior work derived a definition of \"spiritual support\" through co-design workshops with stakeholders in online health communities. This paper contributes: (1) a revision of that definition through member checking with professional spiritual care providers (SCPs); (2) a novel design framework -- SPIRIT -- which can help to expand models of delivery for spiritual care using digital technologies. Through re-analysis of previous data and new interviews with SCPs, we identify three prerequisites for meaningful spiritual care: openness to care, safe space, and the ability to discern and articulate spiritual needs. We also propose six design dimensions: loving presence, meaning-making, appropriate degree of technology use, location, degree of relational closeness, and temporality. We discuss how SPIRIT offers guidance for designing impactful digital spiritual care intervention systems within and beyond clinical settings.",

We investigate how emotional and psycholinguistic responses differ between financial and non-financial communities, and the extent to which the type of financial event affects user behavior during the two case study periods. To examine the effect of these events on expressed language, we analyze daily sentiment, emotion, and LIWC counts using quasi-experimental methods: Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Causal Impact analyses during a financial boom and a financial crash. Overall, we find coherent, negative shifts in emotional responses during financial crashes, but weaker, mixed responses during booms, consistent with loss aversion.

However, little is known about the characteristics of these GenAI-based chatbots and their user interactions. Drawing on the functional theory of NSFW on social media, this study analyzes 376 NSFW chatbots and 307 public conversation sessions on FlowGPT. Findings identify four chatbot types: roleplay characters, story generators, image generators, and do-anything-now bots. AI Characters portraying fantasy personas and enabling hangout-style interactions are most common, often using explicit avatar images to invite engagement. Sexual, violent, and insulting content appears in both user prompts and chatbot outputs, with some chatbots generating explicit material even when users do not create erotic prompts. In sum, the NSFW experience on FlowGPT can be understood as a combination of virtual intimacy, sexual delusion, violent thought expression, and unsafe content acquisition. We conclude with implications for chatbot design, creator support, user safety, and content moderation.",

    "title": "Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.24709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a quadratic similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in DINO, CLIP, and ImageNet-supervised ViTs, but is markedly weaker in MAE, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of \"which parts belong together\" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.10397v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is often regarded as a presynaptic filter of spikes, independent of postsynaptic activity. Recent experiments, however, indicate an associative STP that depends on pre- and postsynaptic coactivation. We develop a normative, information-theoretic theory of associative STP. Extending Fisher-information-based learning to Tsodyks-Markram synapses, we derive learning rules for baseline weight and release probability that maximize stimulus information under resource constraints. The rules split into a postsynaptic term tracking local firing and a presynaptic, phase-advanced term that selectively detects stimulus onset. For slowly varying inputs, this onset sensitivity favors anti-causal connectivity and enhances response offset during drive and reverse replay after drive removal in recurrent circuits. Linear-response analysis shows that STP yields frequency-dependent phase selectivity and that release-probability constraints tune temporal asymmetry. These results identify release-probability plasticity as a principled substrate for rapidly reconfigurable temporal coding.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.10221v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Learning, inference, and emergence in biological and artificial systems are often studied within disparate theoretical frameworks, ranging from energy-based models to recurrent and attention-based architectures. Here we develop a unified dynamical field theory in which learning and inference are governed by a minimal stochastic dynamical equation admitting a Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--de Dominicis formulation. Within this framework, inference corresponds to saddle-point trajectories of the associated action, while fluctuation-induced loop corrections render collective modes dynamically emergent and generate nontrivial dynamical time scales. A central result of this work is that cognitive function is controlled not by microscopic units or precise activity patterns, but by the collective organization of dynamical time scales. We introduce the \\emph{time-scale density of states} (TDOS) as a compact diagnostic of the distribution of collective relaxation modes governing inference dynamics. Learning and homeostatic regulation are naturally interpreted as processes that reshape both the effective potential and the underlying state-space geometry, thereby reorganizing the TDOS and selectively stabilizing slow collective modes that support stable inference, memory, and context-dependent computation despite stochasticity and structural irregularity. This framework unifies energy-based models, recurrent neural networks, transformer architectures, and biologically motivated homeostatic dynamics within a single physical description, and provides a principled route toward understanding cognition as an emergent dynamical phenomenon.",

Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with \"rich-get-richer\" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood.

Here, we present a \"Just-in-Time\" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures.

Notably, we employ a large language model (LLM) to assist in discovering the underlying functional relationships among these variables, and compare its performance against traditional methods such as linear and polynomial fitting. Experimental results show that classification accuracy follows a power-law scaling primarily with the number of categories, while the effects of neuron count and stimulus nodes are relatively minor. A key advantage of the LLM-based approach is its ability to propose plausible functional forms beyond pre-defined equation templates, often leading to more concise or accurate mathematical descriptions of the observed scaling laws.

A better understanding of these factors could be provided by cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age (TEA). Objective: To investigate, through cerebral TEA-MRIs, the relationship between the main perinatal factors, the occurrence of cerebral anomalies, and cerebral volumetry. Methods: We assembled a cohort of preterm babies born before 32 weeks of gestation who underwent a cerebral TEA-MRI. We assessed cerebral anomalies using a radiological scoring system -- the Kidokoro scoring -- and performed cerebral volumetry. We investigated the relationships between 9 clinical factors (birth characteristics, resuscitation treatments{\\ldots}), Kidokoro scores, and brain volumes. Results: Among 110 preterms who underwent a cerebral MRI at TEA, only 6% suffered moderate-to-severe brain anomalies. We identified mechanical ventilation as a risk factor for cerebral anomalies (adjusted Odds-Ratio aOR = 4.6, 95% Confidence Interval CI [1.7-12.8]) and prolonged parenteral nutrition as a protective factor for white matter anomalies (aOR = 0.2, 95%CI [0.1-0.8]). Mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01) and being born small for gestational age (p < 0.001) were risk factors for the reduction of cerebral volumes. An increase in brain lesion severity was associated with decreased cerebral volumes (p = 0.016). Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of treatment-related perinatal factors on the occurrence of cerebral anomalies in very and extreme preterms, and the interest in using both qualitative (Kidokoro scoring) and quantitative (volumetry) MRI-tools.",

    "title": "Visual Context Influences Lateral Balance While Walking on Winding Paths",
    "content": "Effectively navigating daily environments necessitates achieving adaptability while maintaining stability. This requires integrating sensory feedback, primarily from the visual system, to maintain balance and maneuverability as we walk. This study examined the impact of visual information salience on lateral balance and stepping. Twenty-eight healthy adults (16F/12M; 26.16{+/-}4.23 years) participated. Participants walked along each of two virtual paths (Straight vs. Winding), having each of two path color contrasts (High vs. Low), in each of two environments with differing visual richness (Rich vs. Sparse). We quantified stepping errors as the percentage of steps landing outside designated path boundaries. We computed means () and standard deviations ({sigma}) of the minimum mediolateral margins of stability (MoSL), and we computed lateral Probability of Instability (PoIL) to assess participants' risk of taking unstable (MoSL < 0) steps. On Straight paths, participants made more stepping errors on Low (vs. High) contrast paths for both environments, and exhibited decreased{sigma} (MoSL) in Sparse (vs. Rich) environments on paths of both visual contrasts. On Winding paths, participants made the most stepping errors on Low Contrast paths in Sparse environments. They walked with smaller (MoSL) and exhibited higher PoIL on Low Contrast paths in both environments, and they exhibited higher PoIL in Sparse environments on paths of both visual contrasts. The effects of diminished visual information were far more pronounced on Winding paths (vs. Straight), hindering performance and balance maintenance, as these conditions challenged both mechanical and sensory mechanisms underlying balance control.",

    "content": "Visual search requires flexible coordination of attention, memory, and category representations across distributed cortical networks. Using large-scale recordings from V4, IT, OFC, and LPFC, we identified distinct neural populations selective for attention and category. Population dynamics robustly represented visual categories during cue presentation, sustained cue information across delays, and differentiated categories and attentional states during search. Cue-related activity predicted subsequent search efficiency, linking pre-search processing to behavioral performance. The orthogonal subspace provided a crucial latent representational structure for encoding and maintaining task-relevant information across search stages. Foveal attention enhanced peripheral representations by both increasing pattern separation and reshaping representational geometry in a non-linear, context-dependent manner. Search dynamics further reflected fixation history and target detection, which modulated both response strength and representational structure. Finally, V4 and IT encoded the spatial geometry of the search array, preserving its layout. Together, these findings highlight population-level dynamics as critical mechanisms supporting goal-directed visual search.",

    "title": "Agomelatine drives sex-specific neuroprotection and reduced pathology in rat and human Alzheimer's models",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains without effective disease-modifying therapies, underscoring the need for interventions that target interconnected molecular and cellular processes driving cognitive decline. Leveraging a cross-species translational framework integrating a progressive rat model of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC-derived neurons carrying familial AD mutations, we identify agomelatine (AGO) as a disease-modifying candidate. A clinically used melatonergic agonist and 5-HT2C serotonergic antagonist, we found that AGO acts as a sex-selective modulator of AD-related neuronal and microglial dysfunction with therapeutic relevance across species. TgF344-AD rats and their wildtype littermates received chronic dietary AGO ({approx}10 mg/kg/day) from 5 to 11 months of age and underwent hippocampal-dependent spatial learning assessment, quantitative hippocampal histopathology, and bulk RNA sequencing to evaluate the therapeutic effect on cognition, pathology, and molecular mechanisms. Human isogenic iPSC-derived cortical neurons carrying PSEN2N141I or APPV717I mutations were treated with 20 M AGO followed by bulk RNA sequencing, to define AGO-driven transcriptional pathway modulation in AD neurons. In TgF344-AD rats, AGO produced robust female-specific benefits. AGO selectively restored hippocampal-dependent cognitive performance in female but not male transgenic rats. These improvements were independent of amyloid burden and instead aligned with reductions in microgliosis and pathogenic AT8-positive tau phosphorylation. Additionally, AGO normalized reactive and amoeboid microglial states exclusively in females and enhanced doublecortin-defined neurogenesis without altering mature NeuN neuronal density. This coordinated hippocampal stabilization highlights AGO's capacity to restore plasticity rather than simply suppress pathology. Transcriptomic analyses revealed sex-divergent mechanisms underlying these effects. In females, AGO activated metabolic, oxygen-handling, lipid-processing, neuroimmune, and CREB/IGF-1 signaling pathways while suppressing ER-stress, epigenetic, and ion-channel transcripts, changes consistent with resilience-promoting cellular reprogramming. In males, AGO preferentially modulated mitochondrial redox biology, transcriptional regulators, and extracellular matrix components. Despite these differences, both sexes showed AGO-induced engagement of conserved AD-relevant pathways, including shared induction of synaptic plasticity and hemoglobin/oxygen-transport related genes, suggesting a convergent neuroprotective molecular signature. To translate these findings to a human system, we examined AGO's effects in PSEN2N141I and APPV717I iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Both mutations produced convergent deficits in synaptic integrity, neuronal maturity, trophic signaling, proteostasis, metabolism, and excitability, alongside dysregulated developmental and ECM-remodeling programs. AGO partially reversed these pathogenic transcriptional changes, up-regulating synaptic, metabolic, vesicle-trafficking, and redox-stress resilience genes while suppressing pathological developmental and inflammatory pathways, demonstrating conserved engagement of neuronal recovery programs. Together, these results identify AGO as a promising non-amyloid therapeutic candidate capable of modulating AD-relevant pathways in rodents and human models. The sex-selective efficacy observed in vivo, combined with conserved transcriptional responses across species, underscores the translational relevance of AGO-driven molecular reprogramming in AD.",

    "content": "Objective. Closed-loop responsive neurostimulators, such as the NeuroPace responsive neurostimulation (RNS) system, continuously monitor brain activity and deliver electrical stimulation in response to abnormal electrographic activity in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Practical technical constraints limit the temporal resolution of these devices, reducing the quality of EEG recordings. Approach. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to convert high-resolution intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) obtained from inpatient monitoring into the same format, parameters, and resolution produced by the RNS system, allowing direct comparison of iEEG with RNS system data. We validated this technique using data from patients who had both iEEG and RNS. Electrodes from the iEEG and RNS system were co-registered onto the same 3D coordinate grid, and vector math was applied to determine the iEEG electrodes closest to the operational RNS electrodes. Main results. Through spectral analysis, we derived a transfer function that accounts for all filtering and data processing produced by the RNS system. Comparison of the recorded data using visual and spectral analysis from iEEG and RNS confirmed that EEG characteristics were correctly transformed by the filtering function, allowing analysis of how iEEG signals would appear within the RNS system. We demonstrate two examples from the extreme edges of the spectra, showing how DC shifts and high frequency oscillations would be transformed by the RNS. We provide a tutorial to tune this method to local device parameters, a process that can be applied to other devices as well. Significance. This tool allows researchers and clinicians to extract EEG biomarkers from high-resolution iEEG and determine if/how they can be detected in lower-resolution RNS. This provides an opportunity to develop patient-specific seizure detection parameters and investigate the long-term effects of neurostimulation therapy.",

    "title": "The amplitude and latency of the earliest signal in V1 encode bottom-up saliency by feature conjunction",
    "content": "The neural origin of bottom-up saliency for exogenous attention remains highly controversial. In this study, we investigated whether the earliest activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) encodes saliency signals defined by the eye-of-origin and feature-conjunction information. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the human occipital cortex revealed early responses to eye-of-origin (E) and/or orientation (O) singletons, with larger response amplitudes to the double-feature (EO) singletons. The short onset latency (58-70 ms) and polarity reversal of the responses indicate a V1 origin. Importantly, the latency and amplitude of these responses predicted behavioral detection performance. Together, these findings suggest that the timing and amplitude of the earliest signals in V1 represent the saliency of combined feature contrasts for bottom-up attention. These signals unlikely originate from projections of other proposed source areas of saliency, due to the scarcity of necessary monocular neurons to process eye-of-origin information.",

    "title": "From cognitive abstraction to adaptive behavior: neural bases of concept learning in autistic adolescents",
    "content": "BACKGROUND: Learned knowledge does not consistently generalize to new contexts in autistic individuals, limiting potential for adapting to real-world demands. This challenge is hypothesized to stem from difficulties with forming abstract representations, potentially arising from perceptual processing that favors local details over the gestalt. We tested the prediction that generalization would be primarily based on exemplar-specific representations in autistic youth using computational modelling coupled with neuroimaging. METHODS: Sixty-four autistic adolescents without intellectual disability (69% males; ages 14-18 years) completed a category generalization task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at two time points. Computational models estimated abstract (prototype-based) and specific (exemplar-based) representations and underlying neural correlates. We further examined associations with adaptive functioning and moderation by autistic traits. RESULTS: Contrary to predictions, we observed a consistent prototype-dominant majority, a subgroup who generalized without consistent representational reliance, and a small minority who failed to acquire category structure. Prototypes were represented in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right frontal pole, and right lateral occipital cortex, while exemplars were represented in bilateral cuneus. Better generalization predicted better real-world adaptive functioning. Moreover, greater prototype-related activation in left IPL predicted better adaptive functioning in participants with higher autistic traits. CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the prevailing view that concept learning in autism relies primarily on hyper-specific perceptual processing, identify meaningful variability in representational strategies, and reveal neural pathways through which abstract representation may support real-world adaptive behavior.",

    "content": "Neural cell types are often clustered into inhibitory, excitatory, or neuromodulatory populations. However, the signaling mechanism between two neurons ultimately depends on their neurotransmitter-receptor pairings. Here, we demonstrate an example of a glutamatergic population of neurons that appears to either excite or inhibit their downstream partners depending on the type of glutamate receptor expressed in the downstream cell type. The upstream population encodes a sinusoidal head direction signal. The downstream partners that are excited by glutamate encode the same signal while the downstream partners that are inhibited by glutamate encode a 180$^degree$ phase-shifted copy. The upstream population therefore appears to pass on two different phases of the same signal by making either excitatory or inhibitory connections to different downstream partners.",

    "content": "Erasing outdated memories is crucial for adaptive behavior. Yet once a cue-outcome association is learned, repeated cue exposure without outcome suppresses conditioned behavior without erasing the underlying memory. This allows rapid behavioral recovery when outcomes are reintroduced. Here, we confirm this limitation for standard prospective extinction protocols that present cues without the associated outcome, but show that true memory erasure is achieved by inverting the paradigm: presenting outcomes without associated cues, i.e., retrospective extinction. We demonstrate that orbitofrontal cortex activity at outcome is necessary for the rapid behavioral recovery following prospective extinction, and that mesolimbic dopamine activity at outcome is necessary for retrospective extinction. These findings reconceptualize extinction mechanisms and suggest complementary strategies to mitigate relapse and erase maladaptive memories.",

    "title": "Minimal Mimics and Maps of Natural Light for Mammals",
    "content": "Light drives processes that include perception and the regulation of circadian rhythms, sleep, metabolism, and development. These processes are initiated by photopigment molecules, each preferentially absorbing particular wavelengths. Light of a given spectrum stimulates an animal's set of photopigments in a specific profile. Natural light and its variations produce stimulation profiles that promote normal physiology. To mimic these profiles using artificial light, we consider the thermally stable, photoconvertible states of relevant photopigments: ground states of rhodopsin and cone photopigments, and three states of melanopsin. This gives a high-dimensional representation of illumination. Nevertheless, we find that two wavelengths suffice to closely mimic the effects of natural light for mammals, including humans and mice. Adjusting the wavelength ratio allows mimicry of natural light's variations, such as those from twilight to noon. Ratio adjustments also compensate for light's filtering by elements like the eye's optics and laboratory cages. Adding a third wavelength makes natural light mimicry nearly perfect. By contrast, common artificial lighting--designed for low-dimensional, human color space--stimulates photopigments in unnatural proportions. We conclude by providing species-specific maps of photopigment stimulation profiles under natural and artificial illumination, which make our observations intuitive while providing insight into the diverse visual ecologies of mammals.",

    "title": "EEG-Based Decoding of Color and Visual Category Representations Is Reliable Within and Across Sessions",
    "content": "The human visual system represents stimuli in a rich and detailed manner. Traditional methods of studying visual representations in humans, such as event-related potentials (ERP), revealed numerous distinctions between the brain activity elicited by different categories of stimuli. However, these methods miss the information embedded in the spatial distributions of brain activity, or patterns, and are not always sensitive to study visual representations of different stimuli at the single participant or single trial level. Time-resolved multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA), or Decoding, efficiently extracts the visual representations of stimuli from the EEG topography without a-priori assumptions about the location of the effect in time and space at the single participant level. The rich information this method provides has increased its popularity dramatically in recent years. Yet, different participants show variable quality of decoding performance, and it is unclear if the accuracy of decoding is maintained within participants across multiple sessions, tasks, attentional conditions and visual features. In the current study, participants performed three visual tasks, over two sessions (1-7 days apart). We examined the correlation of decoding accuracy: within the cross-validation set, between sessions, between features (color and category) and to different measurements of the ERP signal and behavioral performance. We also examined how models generalized to different tasks and different attention conditions. We found that decoding accuracies varied substantially across participants, and that decoding accuracy was reliable within participant, over sessions, attention condition and task. This suggests the decodability behaves like an individual trait. Moreover, the spatial patterns underlying the decoding (classification weights) generalized across different tasks, attentional conditions and sessions. This suggests minimal representational drift at the resolution allowed by the EEG. We conclude that EEG decoding is a reliable method, and that visual representations are stable.",

    "title": "Afterimages drive a shared visual motion reversal illusion in Drosophila",
    "content": "Illusions expose core computations in perception. In one visual apparent-motion illusion, perceptual direction is reversed when phase shifted gratings are interleaved with uniform frames. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila exhibits the same direction reversal reported in mammals. Combining behavior, targeted silencing, two photon imaging, and modeling, we localize the origin of this illusion to elementary motion pathways. Silencing direction selective T4/T5 neurons abolishes the reversal, and recordings reveal that downstream wide field neurons invert their directional preference as interleave duration increases. Replacing periodic gratings with random binary patterns preserves the reversal, implicating afterimages rather than spatial periodicity. Imaging neurons upstream of T4/T5 shows signatures of an afterimage, whose emergence depends on interleave luminance. Critically, dark interleaves suppress afterimages and eliminate both the neural and behavioral reversal, whereas light interleaves preserve or enhance it. Thus, afterimages are central to this shared illusion and explain a deficiency of canonical motion energy accounts. These results link a classic apparent motion phenomenon to identified circuit elements and reveal a simple stimulus manipulation that switches an illusion on and off.",

    "title": "Impact of impaired endogenous neurosteroidogenesis on outcomes following chronic alcohol exposure.",
    "content": "Alcohol use disorder is a major public health concern worldwide and there is a high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been implicated in both mood and alcohol use disorders; however, the mechanisms contributing to the shared pathophysiology remain unknown. Extensive evidence indicates that ethanol modulates GABAergic signaling in the BLA, including actions on neurosteroid-sensitive, extrasynaptic {delta} subunit-containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs), which has been suggested to mediate many of the behavioral effects. In fact, several studies have suggested that 5-reduced neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, may mediate some of the behavioral effects of alcohol. Here we demonstrate that chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure impairs endogenous neurosteroidogenesis via downregulation of key neurosteroidogenic enzymes, 5-reductase type 1 and type 2. To examine the impact of impaired endogenous neurosteroidogenesis of the behavioral consequences of chronic alcohol exposure, including withdrawal-induced anxiety and increased alcohol consumption, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockdown of 5-reductase in the BLA. Reduced expression of 5-reductase in the BLA did not impact post-CIE alcohol intake or anxiety-like behaviors during withdrawal, perhaps because endogenous neurosteroidogenesis is already impaired following CIE. Therefore, we examined the impact of enhancing neurosteroid levels, treating mice post-CIE with SGE-516, a synthetic GABAAR positive allosteric modulator, which increased voluntary alcohol intake. These findings implicate endogenous neurosteroidogenesis in behavioral outcomes associated with withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure. Further, this study suggests that targeting endogenous neurosteroidogenesis may be a novel and useful therapeutic target.",

    "title": "Perceptual reaction times are coupled to the gastric electrical rhythm",
    "content": "The gastric rhythm, a slow (0.05 Hz) electrical oscillation continuously generated by the stomach, phase-synchronises neural activity across all sensory and motor cortices. Yet the functional relevance of this coupling remains unknown. We measured in humans the gastric rhythm with electrogastrography in three independent, distinct experiments (total N = 90): a speeded supra-threshold tactile detection task, a self-paced visual exploration task, and an unspeeded near-threshold visual detection task. Leveraging Spline Generalized Linear Modelling to flexibly uncover higher-order phase-amplitude coupling modes, we found perceptual reaction times (RTs) to be coupled to gastric phase across all experiments. Coupling to gastric phase was independent from effects of cardiac and respiratory rhythms' rates and phases. By showing that the gastric rhythm contributes to the internal state shaping perceptual variability on a scale comparable to cardiac and respiratory rhythms, this work opens a new avenue for the understanding of the function of gastric-brain coupling.",

    "title": "How Visual Context Influences Lateral Stepping Regulation While Walking on Winding Paths",
    "content": "Goal-directed walking involves regulating foot placements to achieve specific tasks. This requires visuomotor integration. Perceptual, cognitive, and contextual salience guide attention and motor planning for navigation. Here, we quantified how perceptual salience informs lateral foot placement while walking. Participants walked along prescribed virtual paths (straight or winding), thus keeping contextual salience (the task itself) constant. We manipulated perceptual salience by systematically altering environment richness (rich vs. sparse) and path color contrast (high vs. low). We thus tested the extent to which stepping control is determined only by the walking path (i.e. its shape), or is also influenced by task-relevant salience of the paths (only), and/or the salience of the surrounding environment. We quantified head pitch angle to approximate gaze direction. We quantified lateral stepping regulation from a Goal Equivalent Manifold framework. On winding (vs. straight) paths, participants looked down more (lower mean head pitch) and more consistently (less variable head pitch). They took narrower, more variable steps and corrected stepping errors more strongly. This confirmed the predominant influence of task (contextual salience) on stepping control. On low (vs. high) contrast paths, participants looked down more and exhibited greater variability in lateral position on their path with weaker error correction. Higher contrast paths elicited stronger and more consistent stepping control. Walking in sparse (vs. rich) environments yielded somewhat less consistent, but still significant changes in head pitch and stepping regulation. Salience manipulations affected stepping differently on straight versus winding paths. Therefore, perceptual salience influences step-to-step control during naturalistic walking.",

    "title": "The Vesicular Glutamate Transporter Modulates Sex and Region-Specific Differences in Dopaminergic Neuron \u03b1-Synuclein Toxicity by Modifying Cytosolic Dopamine Levels",
    "content": "Parkinson's disease disproportionately affects males; however, the cause of this sex difference is unknown. We found that expressing mutant -synuclein A53T in Drosophila dopamine neurons recapitulates the sex differences observed in human Parkinson's disease patients. Male flies exhibited greater age-related motor impairment and more severe dopamine neuron degeneration than females. Selective masculinization of female dopamine neurons via knockdown of the sex determination gene Transformer eliminated the observed sex differences in locomotor ability and neurodegeneration by increasing the severity of motor defects and degeneration in females. Transformer knockdown in dopamine neurons also reduced total vesicular glutamate transporter staining in the brain. Direct knockdown of the vesicular glutamate transporter in female dopamine neurons expressing -synuclein A53T exacerbated motor dysfunction, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and accelerated dopamine neuron degeneration. Increasing cytosolic dopamine via knockdown of the vesicular monoamine transporter or increasing total dopamine levels via levodopa treatment phenocopied vesicular glutamate transporter knockdown; furthermore, reducing total dopamine via alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine treatment protected against vesicular glutamate transporter knockdown. These results support a model in which lower VGLUT levels in dopamine neurons result in higher levels of cytosolic dopamine, which leads to dopamine mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to -synuclein A53T toxicity.",

    "title": "Measurement of tau protein and A\u03b2 amyloid plaques in postmortem human brains of Down syndrome and Alzheimers disease by using IBETA autoradiography",
    "content": "The accumulation of tau tangles and A{beta} plaques are prominent neuropathologies that characterize Alzheimers disease (AD) and Down Syndrome (DS). Continuous developments of PET tracers as biomarkers can be supported by autoradiography to validate effectiveness and accuracy of binding properties that elucidate the pathophysiology of DSAD and AD. This in vitro comparative study evaluates [125I]IPPI binding to tau and [125I]IBETA binding to A{beta} plaques in the frontal cortex (FCX) and temporal cortex (TCX) of postmortem human brain slices of AD (n=5), DSAD (n=5), and cognitively normal (CN) (n=5) cases. With anti-tau and anti-A{beta} immunostains confirming the presence of tau and A{beta} plaques, [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA binding in autoradiographic images were significantly higher in DSAD and AD gray matter (GM) compared to CN. When comparing DSAD with AD, FCX and TCX GM binding was similar throughout DSAD and AD except in FCX GM where there was 48% more [125I]IPPI binding in DSAD than AD. In vitro drug inhibition studies revealed that [125I]IPPI binding was significantly inhibited with increasing harmine concentrations (IC50=115{+/-}40 nM) in DSAD FCX and TCX but KuFal194 minimally inhibited [125I]IPPI binding in the same cases. The GM/white matter ratios for DSAD ([125I]IPPI=4.1, [125I]IBETA=2.9) and AD ([125I]IPPI=4.2, [125I]IBETA=2.6) were significantly greater than CN ([125I]IPPI=1.3, [125I]IBETA=1.2). A positive correlation between [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA binding suggests a synergistic relationship between tau and A{beta} plaque in DSAD and AD pathology. This study demonstrates that [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA may serve as novel radiotracers in both DSAD and AD to continue diagnostic investigations in vivo.",

    "title": "The core herpes simplex-1 fusion complex drives cell-to-cell spreading of pathological Tau",
    "content": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by the pathological aggregation of the host-encoded protein Tau into amyloid fibrils. Pathologic protein aggregates composed of Tau are able to spread from cell-to-cell, thereby contributing to disease progression. The exact mechanisms of intercellular dissemination remain ill-defined. Mounting evidence links the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) to the aetiology of AD. HSV-1 is a prevalent neurotropic virus that replicates in epithelial cells at the site of infection, and subsequently establishes lifelong latency in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In the quiescent latent state, AD brains show elevated expression of structural viral proteins in the absence of virus production. We hypothesized that HSV-1 glycoproteins involved in viral attachment and fusion facilitate the intercellular spreading of proteopathic seeds. Using cellular models, we demonstrate that expression of the HSV-1 core fusion complex, essential for viral entry and direct cell-to-cell transmission, is sufficient to promote aggregate dissemination between cells. Moreover, anti-HSV-1 antibodies present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HSV-1 encephalitis efficiently neutralize viral infection, block viral cell-to-cell transmission, and inhibit propagation of pathological Tau. Thus, latent HSV-1 infection of the brain could contribute to neurodegenerative disease progression, and antiviral antibodies may represent a potential therapeutic strategy.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Tony.<p>I built Grov (<a href=\"https://grov.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://grov.dev/</a>) because I hit a wall with current AI coding assistants: they are \"single-player.\" The moment I kill a terminal pane or close a chat session, the high-level reasoning and architectural decisions generated during that session are lost. If a teammate touches that same code an hour later, their agent has to re-derive everything from scratch or read many documentation files for basically any feature implemented or bug fixed.<p>I wanted to stop writing a lot of docs for everything just to give context to my agents or have to re-explain to my agents what my teammate did and why.<p>Grov is an open-source context layer that effectively gives your team's AI agents a shared, persistent memory.<p>Here is the technical approach:<p>1. Decision-grain memory, not document storage: When you sync a memory, Grov structures knowledge at the decision level. We capture the specific aspect (e.g., \"Auth Strategy\"), the choice made (\"JWT\"), and the reasoning (\"Stateless for scaling\"). Crucially, when your codebase evolves, we don't overwrite memories, we mark old decisions as superseded and link them to the new choice. This gives your team an audit trail of architectural evolution, not just the current snapshot.<p>2. Git-like branches for memories: Teams experimenting with different approaches can create memory branches. Memories on a feature branch stay isolated until you are ready to merge. Access control mirrors Git: main is team-wide, while feature branches keep noise isolated. When you merge the branch, those accumulated insights become instantly available to everyone's agents.<p>3. Two-stage injection (Token Optimization): The expensive part of shared memory isn't storage it's the context window. Loading 10 irrelevant memories wastes tokens and confuses the model. Grov uses a \"Preview \u2192 Expand\" strategy:\n Preview: A hybrid semantic/keyword search returns lightweight memory summaries (~100 tokens). \n Expand: The full reasoning traces (~500-1k tokens) are only injected if the agent explicitly requests more detail. This typically results in a 50-70% token reduction per session compared to raw context dumping.<p>The result: Your teammate's agent doesn't waste 5 minutes re-exploring why you chose Postgres over Redis, or re-reading auth middleware. It just knows, because your agent already figured it out and shared it.<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/TonyStef/Grov\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/TonyStef/Grov</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46711958\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46711958</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>",

    "content": "Tonic inhibition and its transient removal are fundamental neural mechanisms for gating activity, suppressing out-of-phase excitation, and enhancing the temporal precision of behavior. However, their roles within locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs) remain poorly understood. Here, we identify A02l neurons - segmentally repeated excitatory interneurons in the Drosophila larval ventral nerve cord (VNC) - that regulate crawling behavior through tonic inhibition. A02l neurons exhibit high baseline activity and are transiently suppressed during motor output. They provide excitatory input to inhibitory premotor networks, enabling widespread silencing of motor neurons to maintain muscle relaxation. Optogenetic activation of A02l neurons reduced crawling frequency, whereas their inhibition induced transient whole-body contractions. Together, these findings reveal a cellular-resolution mechanism for tonic inhibition within the nerve cord and highlight its importance in gating motor output and maintaining motor quiescence.",

We identified a previously unrecognized population of titin-expressing (TTN+) tissue-resident macrophages characterized by coordinated activation of cytoskeletal remodeling, phagocytosis, autophagy, and inflammatory programs. Isoform-specific qPCR, protein immunofluorescence, and single-molecule FISH validated TTN expression in situ. In AD, TTN+ macrophages expand and undergo broad transcriptional rewiring, including activation of MEF2-linked mechanotransduction pathways, elevated senescence signatures, and a loss of ligand-receptor connectivity with epithelial, endothelial, and stromal partners. Collectively, our findings define a mechanosensitive macrophage program at the blood-CSF interface and uncover a TTN-associated shift in macrophage function and microenvironment integration in AD.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Pingram is a lightweight, one-dependency Python library for sending Telegram messages, photos, documents, audio, and video using your bot. It\u2019s focused entirely on outbound alerts, ideal for scripts, bots, or internal tools that need to notify a user or group via Telegram as a free service.</p> <p>No webhook setup, no conversational interface, just direct message delivery using HTTPX under the hood.</p> <p>Example usage:</p> <pre><code>from pingram import Pingram bot = Pingram(token=&quot;&lt;your-token&gt;&quot;) bot.message(chat_id=123456789, text=&quot;Backup complete&quot;) </code></pre> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Pingram is designed for:</p> <ul> <li>Developers who want fast, scriptable messaging without conversational features</li> <li>Users replacing email/SMS alerts in cron jobs, containers, or monitoring tools</li> <li>Python devs looking for a minimal alternative to heavier Telegram bot frameworks</li> <li>Projects that want to embed notifications without requiring stateful servers or polling</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s production-usable for simple alerting use cases but not intended for full-scale bot development.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Compared to python-telegram-bot, Telethon, or aiogram:</p> <ul> <li>Pingram is &lt;100 LOC, no event loop, no polling, no webhooks \u2014 just a clean HTTP client</li> <li>Faster to integrate for one-off use cases like \u201csend this report\u201d or \u201cnotify on job success\u201d</li> <li>Easier to audit, minimal API surface, and no external dependencies beyond httpx</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s more of a messaging transport layer than a full bot framework.</p> <p>Would appreciate thoughts, use cases, or suggestions.

    "title": "Enhancer-based AAV approach for selective AADC delivery reduces motor symptoms and dyskinesia in Parkinson's mouse models",
    "content": "Profound degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons and reduced DA levels in the brain is recognized as an underlying cause of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The standard treatment for PD is levodopa (L-DOPA), but its effectiveness wanes over time and prolonged usage can lead to L-DOPA-induced-dyskinesia (LID). An adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based strategy to overexpress aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the striatum combined with L-DOPA therapy shows promise for symptomatic improvement but requires an invasive delivery approach. Here, we generated enhancer AAVs to drive AADC expression in key cell types and paired them with a blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrant capsid. We characterized the AAVs in mouse following multiple routes of administration and found that cell-type specific viral treatment ameliorated motor deficits and LID in PD disease models. This cell type-specific viral rescue strategy showed similar or better phenotypic rescue compared to a ubiquitous targeting approach and improved mortality. Additionally, we characterized the expression of an AAV-AADC vector capable of mouse phenotypic rescue in non-human primate (NHP) following two routes of administration. This novel therapeutic strategy in combination with L-DOPA may enable a less invasive and better tolerated approach to treat motor deficits in PD patients.",

    "title": "Integrating Acoustic, Prosodic, and Phonological Features for Automatic Alzheimer's Detection",
    "content": "Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for effective intervention. While previous studies have explored speech-based biomarkers for AD, this paper presents the first systematic investigation of acoustic, prosodic, and phonological speech features for detecting this neurocognitive disorder. Our study has two main objectives: (1) to assess the individual impact of AD on a wide range of speech features, and (2) to identify the most informative feature subsets using a combination of four feature ranking methods and seven machine learning classifiers. We conducted our experiments using the publicly available ADReSS Challenge dataset, allowing for direct comparison with prior speech-based approaches. Our analysis focused on continuous acoustic and prosodic measures as well as discrete phonological features, both independently and in combination. The best performance, with an F1-score of 0.89, was achieved using the optimal subset of acoustic features with ensemble learning and by integrating all three feature types, suggesting that combining continuous and categorical speech features offers complementary diagnostic value. This approach surpasses all previous speech-only methods in the ADReSS Challenge and comes close to the best reported overall result from the campaign's dataset, even without using lexical information. The results were further validated through positive outcomes on the Delaware corpus (focused on MCI) and a set of speeches from President Ronald Reagan (who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's). These findings suggest that speech patterns, beyond just the content, are more indicative of Alzheimer's disease than previously thought, underscoring the potential of multi-layered speech analysis for non-invasive AD detection. Keywords: Alzheimer's Disease, acoustics, speech biomarkers, phonology, prosody, non-invasive automatic screening of AD, text & speech mining, neurodegenerative disease",

    "content": "BackgroundChronic low-back pain (CLBP) is a leading cause of disability, with current treatments offering only modest benefits. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) may enhance exercise therapy by modulating cortical excitability and pain-inhibitory pathways. This systematic review and meta-analysis quantified the additive effect of combining tDCS with structured exercise in adults with CLBP.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, CENTRAL, Embase, and CNKI up to 25 September 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing active tDCS plus identical exercise therapy vs. sham tDCS plus the same exercise in adults with CLBP (\u2265 12 weeks) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) were calculated for pain and function, respectively.GRADE was used to assess certainty.ResultsFive RCTs (n = 195) were included. For pain intensity (4 studies, n = 173), tDCS showed a significant additive effect (WMD = \u22120.99, 95% CI: \u22121.68 to \u22120.31, p = 0.006, I2 = 60.1%). For physical function (five studies, n = 195), the effect was favorable but non-significant (SMD = \u22120.65, 95% CI: \u22121.87 to 0.57, p = 0.28, I2 = 90.7%). Meta-regression indicated intervention duration significantly moderated functional outcomes (\u03b2 = 0.56, p < 0.001). GRADE certainty was moderate for pain and low for function.ConclusionAnodal tDCS combined with exercise provides a modest but significant additional reduction in pain intensity for CLBP. Longer intervention duration may enhance functional outcomes. Clinical significance should be interpreted cautiously. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to confirm these findings and optimize stimulation parameters.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251151315, identifier CRD420251151315.",

    "title": "A synaptic locus of song learning",
    "content": "Learning by imitation is the foundation for verbal and musical expression, but its underlying neural basis remains obscure. A juvenile male zebra finch imitates the multisyllabic song of an adult tutor in a process that depends on a song-specialized cortico-basal ganglia circuit, affording a powerful system to identify the synaptic substrates of imitative motor learning. Plasticity at a particular set of cortico-basal ganglia synapses is hypothesized to drive rapid learning-related changes in song before these changes are subsequently consolidated in downstream circuits. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is untested and the synaptic locus where learning initially occurs is unknown. By combining a computational framework to quantify song learning with synapse-specific optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations within and directly downstream of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, we identified the specific cortico-basal ganglia synapses that drive the acquisition and expression of rapid vocal changes during juvenile song learning and characterized the hours-long timescale over which these changes consolidate. Furthermore, transiently augmenting postsynaptic activity in the basal ganglia briefly accelerates learning rates and persistently alters song, demonstrating a direct link between basal ganglia activity and rapid learning. These results localize the specific cortico-basal ganglia synapses that enable a juvenile songbird to learn to sing and reveal the circuit logic and behavioral timescales of this imitative learning paradigm.",

    "content": "Dendrites transform local electrical activity into intracellular Ca2+ signals that drive plasticity [1,2], yet the voltage [-&gt;] Ca2+ mapping during natural behavior remains poorly defined. Here, we measure this transfer function via simultaneous voltage and Ca2+ imaging throughout the dendritic arbors of hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons in behaving mice. Dendritic Ca2+ exhibited a hierarchical activation pattern dominated by back-propagating action potentials: simple spikes primarily drove somatic and proximal Ca2+, whereas complex spikes produced larger somatic Ca2+ signals and propagated farther into distal dendrites, sometimes in a branch-selective manner. Dendrite-restricted co-activation of voltage and Ca2+ without concurrent somatic events was rare. A biophysics-inspired model accurately predicted local Ca2+ transients from local voltage waveforms. Our data and model provide a quantitative understanding of when -- and why -- dendritic Ca2+ signals in CA2 pyramidal cells arise during behavior.",

    "content": "<p>I made this for myself, and it seemed like it might be useful to others. I'd love some feedback, both on the threat model and the tool itself. I hope you find it useful!<p>Backstory: I've been using many agents in parallel as I work on a somewhat ambitious financial analysis tool. I was juggling agents working on epics for the linear solver, the persistence layer, the front-end, and planning for the second-generation solver. I was losing my mind playing whack-a-mole with the permission prompts. YOLO mode felt so tempting. And yet.<p>Then it occurred to me: what if YOLO mode isn't so bad? Decision fatigue is a thing. If I could cap the blast radius of a confused agent, maybe I could just review once. Wouldn't that be safer?<p>So that day, while my kids were taking a nap, I decided to see if I could put YOLO-mode Claude inside a sandbox that blocks exfiltration and regulates git access. The result is yolo-cage.<p>Also: the AI wrote its own containment system from inside the system's own prototype. Which is either very aligned or very meta, depending on how you look at it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706796\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706796</a></p>\n<p>Points: 18</p>\n<p># Comments: 24</p>",

    "title": "Effectiveness of transcranial electrical stimulation combined with dual-task training in stroke, mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson\u2019s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
    "content": "AimIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) or transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) combined with dual task training (DTT) on physical and cognitive functions in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and stroke disorders.MethodWe conducted a systematic search of the Web of Science, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and CINAHL databases for English-language literature on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of tDCS, tACS, or tRNS combined with DTT in adults with MCI, PD, and stroke. The search covered studies from the inception of each database up to November 21, 2025. The initial screening of selected articles was conducted independently by two researchers (YLQ and WLW).ResultsA total of twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising individuals with stroke (n\u202f=\u202f4), MCI (n\u202f=\u202f3), and PD (n\u202f=\u202f5). Meta-analysis revealed that active tDCS+DTT yielded no significant overall improvement in global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): SMD\u202f=\u202f0.09, 95% CI [\u22120.49, 0.66], p =\u202f0.77, I2 =\u202f72%). A large, highly homogeneous benefit was observed for executive function (TMT-B: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.33, 95% CI [\u22122.39, \u22120.27], p =\u202f0.01), driven exclusively by the MCI subgroup (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22122.35, 95% CI [\u22123.20, \u22121.51], I2 =\u202f0%). Timed Up and Go cognitive-motor dual-task (TUG CMDT) cadence improved overall (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.58, 95% CI [0.09, 1.08], p =\u202f0.02, I2 =\u202f39%) in both MCI and stroke subgroups. TUG motor dual task (MDT) speed improved modestly (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.42, 95% CI [0.02, 0.83], p =\u202f0.04, I2 =\u202f34%), and CMDT speed showed a strong trend (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.49, p =\u202f0.09), only significant in stroke (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.42, p =\u202f0.002). However, this generalized finding must be nuanced by specific efficacy observed in individual PD studies, which reported significant gains in force-tremor decoupling, postural stability, and CMDT accuracy.ConclusionThe meta-analysis suggests that the effects of tDCS combined with DTT are remarkable in certain populations and for specific outcomes. While substantial improvements are confirmed for executive function and dual-task gait in MCI and stroke, the overall limited efficacy in PD highlights the critical influence of heterogeneity and intervention specificity. Future research should prioritize disease-specific electrode montages and the integration of tACS or tRNS to optimize outcomes across diverse neurological populations.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've been using Python for a while now and it's my main language. It is such a wonderful language. Guido had wonderful design choices in forcing whitespace to disallow curly braces and discouraging semicolons so much I almost didn't know they existed. There's even a synonym for beautiful; it's called <em>pythonic</em>.</p> <p>I will probably not use the absolute elephant dung that is NodeJS ever again. Everything that JavaScript has is in Python, but better. And whatever exists in JS but not Python is because it didn't need to exist in Python because it's unnecessary. For example, Flask is like Express but better. I'm not stuck in callback hell or dependency hell.</p> <p>The only cross-device difference I've faced is sys.exit working on Linux but not working on Windows. But in web development, you gotta face vendor prefixes, CSS resets, graceful degradation, some browsers not implementing standards right, etc. Somehow, Python is more cross platform than the web is. Hell, Python even runs on the web.</p> <p>I still love web development though, but writing Python code is just the pinnacle of wonderful computer experiences. This is the same language where you can make a website, a programming language, a video game (3d or 2d), a web scraper, a GUI, etc. </p> <p>Whenever I find myself limited, it is never implementation-wise. It's never because there aren't enough functions. I'm only limited by my (temporary) lack of ideas. Python makes me love programming more than I already did.</p> <p>But C, oh, C is cool but a bit limiting IMO because all the higher level stuff you take for granted like lists and whatever aren't there, and that wastes your time and kind of limits what you can do. C++ kinda solves this with the &lt;vector&gt; module but it is still a hassle implementing stuff compared to Python, where it's very simple to just define a list like [1,2,3] where you can easily add more elements without needing a fixed size. </p> <p>The C and C++ language's limitations make me heavily appreciate what Python does, especially as it is coded in C. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JeffTheMasterr\"> /u/JeffTheMasterr </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qirtk9/i_really_enjoy_python_compared_to_other_coding/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qirtk9/i_really_enjoy_python_compared_to_other_coding/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Cortical folding is a defining feature of human brain development, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms that produce regionally specific cortical folding remain incompletely understood. Here we combined high-resolution in-utero T2-weighted and diffusion MRI atlases (23-38 weeks of gestational age) with prenatal transcriptomic profiles to map regional macrostructural and microstructural features of cortical folding to underlying gene expression. We found genes whose expression patterns correlated with cortical curvature were enriched for neurogenesis, progenitor proliferation and radial glia guided neuronal migration, and localized to ventricular zone/subventricular zone progenitor cell subtypes, supporting for the protomap hypothesis of areal specification. By contrast, cortical microstructural markers-associated gene sets were implicated in myelination, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling, and mapped to astrocyte and endothelial cell programs. The microstructure-related gene expression peaked in the early postnatal period and remained high throughout childhood, while the curvature-associated gene expression reduced with age. Several of these cortical folding-related genes overlapped with autism spectrum disorder risk loci (e.g., SCN2A, STXBP1, DVL3). Collectively, these cross-modal findings outline a sequential developmental architecture--early progenitor driven patterning followed by myelin and extracellular matrix consolidation. In addition, we released a high-resolution fetal labeling atlas to facilitate further imaging-genetic studies of early cortical development.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "title": "Pain-regulation circuitry as a predictor of chronic pain phenotypes",
    "content": "Background: Chronic pain is a multidimensional condition in which emotional distress, negative expectations, and functional impairment signal greater disease severity. Standard diagnostic categories often fail to capture clinically meaningful heterogeneity, highlighting the need for mechanistic phenotyping. Methods: We studied 159 individuals with fibromyalgia or chronic low back pain and 72 healthy controls. Participants completed a cue-based expectation task with calibrated thermal stimuli. Principal component and cluster analyses were used to derive high and low pain, disability, and affective distress (PDA) phenotypes. Groups were compared on expectation-induced pain modulation (EIPM) and resting state connectivity of periaqueductal gray (PAG) subregions. Stepwise machine learning models evaluated whether clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging features could classify PDA phenotypes. Results: High PDA patients exhibited impaired pain modulation when positive expectations were violated, particularly under low-threat cues (P<0.05), and reported higher catastrophizing, hypervigilance, and medication use than low PDA patients. Resting-state analyses revealed more negative dorsolateral/lateral PAG to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex coupling in the high PDA group. Machine learning models classified PDA subtypes above chance, with maximal accuracy when PAG connectivity was combined with clinical and behavioral measures. Conclusions: Severe chronic pain characterized by high emotional distress, disability, and pain is associated with disrupted expectation driven modulation and altered PAG connectivity. Integrating symptom profiles with neural and behavioral markers provides a biologically informed framework for identifying phenotypes with distinct treatment needs. These results suggest that expectation-related pain regulation and midbrain circuitry represent complementary mechanistic targets for precision interventions in chronic pain.",

    "title": "Cortico-Hippocampal phase-amplitude coupling is a signature of learned audiovisual associations in humans",
    "content": "Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) has been proposed as an elegant neural mechanism for representing sequential items in memory, coordinating distant brain regions, and parsing complex sensory inputs. Yet, whether PAC carries content-specific, behaviorally meaningful information has not been demonstrated to date. Here, using human intracranial recordings before, during and after an audio-visual associative learning task, we show that PAC is an information-coding mechanism. PAC strength in cortico-hippocampal networks increased linearly during learning and remained significantly stronger post vs. pre-learning. More importantly, PAC comodulograms carried stimulus- and association-specific information: auditory items were decodable in auditory cortex before learning based on PAC features, while learned associations were classified across hippocampo-temporo-frontal networks during and after learning. Post-learning brain decoding confusion matrices closely mirrored behavioral confusion matrices, and PAC patterns were independent of low-level stimulus features. These findings suggest that PAC is an endogenously generated marker that supports perception and associative learning in the human brain.",

    "content": "Overarching conceptualizations propose a critical role of the default mode network (DMN) in self-referential mental time travel, particularly in autobiographical memory retrieval and episodic future thinking, and internal (intrinsic) emotion generation and regulation. However, these conceptualizations have not been directly evaluated. Against this background, the present fMRI study aimed to identify both shared and distinct neural systems underlying autobiographical episodic processing across different temporal contexts - specifically, episodic memory retrieval (EMR) and episodic future thinking (EFT) - and to examine how these systems interact with affective experiences, including valence and arousal. Our findings demonstrated the central role of the DMN - encompassing the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and medial temporal lobe (MTL) - in both EMR and EFT. Importantly, we identified a functional dissociation along both valence and temporal dimensions: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was more strongly associated with positive experiences and simulations, whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was consistently engaged during the processing of negative affect across past and future contexts. Moreover, representational similarity and parametric analyses indicated that the hippocampus supports differential processing of valence and arousal across temporal domains. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence for the involvement of cortical midline core DMN systems in autobiographical processing across time and suggest overlapping and distinct systems for the integration of emotional experiences across mental time travel.",

    "title": "A reproducible human brain tissue model to study physiological and disease-associated microglia phenotypes",
    "content": "Stem-cell-based in vitro models offer promising potential to elucidate human brain cell functions and interactions under physiological and pathological conditions. However, harnessing this potential is impaired by low reproducibility, maturity, or cell-type diversity of existing models. Especially, prolonged incorporation of mature microglia and studies of neuroinflammation have proven challenging. Here, we developed a 3D cortical brain tissue model (3BTM) containing neurons, astrocytes, and microglia with high reproducibility, maturity, and viability. 3BTMs show morphological, functional, and proteomic maturation of all cell types, leading to high similarity to their in vivo counterparts. Incorporated microglia survive for over 6 months and display mature morphology, functions, and gene expression. Importantly, when engineered to model Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, 3BTMs recapitulate key disease hallmarks including amyloid deposition, increased phospho-Tau levels, and neuroinflammation, with microglia shifting their transcriptional landscape to disease-relevant signatures. Treatment of AD 3BTMs with anti-A{beta} immunotherapy cleared deposits and largely reversed disease signatures in glia. Together, our model offers unprecedented possibilities for studying physiological and pathological states of human brain tissue and translational applications.",

    "title": "Medial Olivocochlear Activity Modulates Central Auditory Synapse Structure and Function",
    "content": "In many mammals, the auditory system is immature at birth and undergoes activity-dependent refinement. The medial olivocochlear system (MOC) contributes to the maturation of central auditory connectivity by shaping spontaneous activity in the developing inner ear. Although altered MOC activity has been linked to electrical and synaptic dysfunctions in different central auditory nuclei, an in-depth analysis of the same synapse under conditions of absent versus enhanced MOC activity is lacking. In this work, we set out a physiological and structural analysis of the calyx of Held and the principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (CH-MNTB) synapse at postnatal days 12-14 in three mouse models of either sex: wild-type (WT), 9 knock-in (9KI; with enhanced MOC activity), and 9 knock-out (9KO; which lacks MOC activity). Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices revealed a reduced synaptic strength efficacy in 9KI compared to WT, including smaller excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes, stronger short-term depression during repetitive stimulation and a decrease readily releasable pool size. In contrast, 9KO mice showed minimal synaptic differences relative to WT. Serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) reconstructions demonstrated morphological alterations of the CH in both MOC-manipulated mouse models. However, 9KI mice exhibited the largest deviations, including fewer morphologically complex CHs and increased poly-innervation of MNTB cells. These results indicate that transient, well-regulated efferent control of cochlear activity is crucial for establishing accurate central auditory connectivity. Moreover, the enhancement of MOC activity drives more pronounced developmental changes in brainstem auditory circuitry than its absence.",

    "title": "Replication Challenges in Linking Personality to Resting-State Functional Connectomics",
    "content": "An increasing number of studies are currently focusing on \"personality neuroscience\", a term labeling the research aimed at neuroimaging correlates of inter-individual temperament and character variability. Among other methods, a graph theoretical analysis of the functional connectivity in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was applied in a study by Gao et al (2013), reporting novel functional connectivity correlates of personality traits. The current paper presents an independent validation of the results of this study and discusses the related challenges, including extension of the original statistical methods in order to illustrate the effect of the multiple comparison problem. Five personality dimensions were obtained using the revised \"Big Five\" Personality Inventory, including scores of Extraversion and Neuroticism covered in the original paper. Using a larger sample (84 subjects) with power over eighty percent, we failed to replicate any of the nine specific neuroimaging correlates of personality presented by Gao et al. While acknowledging differences in the experimental procedures, we discuss that the lack of replication might be caused by the relatively liberal control of false positives in the original study. Indeed, the original testing scheme leads to an expected count of about 10 false positive observations among all tests; applying this scheme to our data we observed a similar number of positive tests, albeit for different relations. No significant correlations were found in our data when standard family-wise error control was applied. These results illustrate the importance of combining exploration with independent validation, use of large datasets, as well as appropriate control of multiple comparison problem in order to prevent false alarms in research into neurological substrates of personality differences. Of course, our findings to disprove the existence of link between personality and brain's intrinsic functional architecture; but rather suggest such link might be even more subtle and elusive than previously reported.",

    "title": "Modular Integration of Auditory Instructions and Visual Cues into the Cortical Reach Network",
    "content": "Humans depend on the brain's ability to integrate multisensory cues for 'top-down' motor strategies with 'bottom-up' stimulus attributes. For example, one can be verbally instructed to use different grasp strategies to acquire an object with the same visual attributes. Conversely, failure to integrate such cues, i.e., following brain damage, could greatly impair goal-directed behavior. To understand how such cues are mapped onto action plans, we employed an event-related fMRI paradigm in which visual and auditory cues were presented successively in randomized order. Twelve participants viewed a physical cube presented to their left or right (bottom-up sensory input) and were verbally instructed to perform a horizontal or vertical grip (top-down motor strategy). To map brain activity through the task, we employed univariate activation analysis, region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, graph-theory analysis (GTA) based connectivity analyses, and used GTA features to decode cue-order information. Univariate voxel-wise and ROI analysis confirmed order-dependent activation of visual and auditory cortex, followed by mounting parietofrontal activation as cues accumulated for action. GTA analysis revealed two significant subnetworks (modules): one spanning Occipital-Parietal-Somatomotor Cortex (likely for integrating visual object attributes into the reach plan) and the other spanning Temporal-Frontal-Somatomotor Cortex (likely for integrating instructions into the grasp plan). Cue order influenced modularity, i.e., the module corresponding to the first cue module tended to dominate contralateral motor cortex. A classification model decoded cue order, based primarily on modularity. Local (within module) network hubs occupied traditional cortical action areas and were order-independent, whereas global (between modules) network hubs were more scattered and order-dependent. These results show that sensorimotor integration is modular, depending on cue modality, functional relevance of the cue, and presentation order. The occipital-parietal / temporal-frontal modularity observed here suggests that the brain can flexibly map sensory inputs through different cortical pathways to achieve effective multisensory-motor integration.",

    "title": "Infant cortical tracking of speech shows emerging spatial release from masking in the first year of life",
    "content": "Natural listening environments are filled with competing sounds. One mechanism that helps overcome this challenge is spatial release from masking (SRM), whereby spatial separation between a target signal and interfering sounds improves perception of the target. SRM has been observed in a wide range of species including songbirds, crocodilians, ferrets, and human adults, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved strategy for listening in noise. However, an important question remains: Is an infant's developing brain able to tap into the same mechanism to cope with the noisy world? To address this question, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 7- and 11-month-old infants (N = 53) and adults (N = 20) as they listened to natural speech in quiet, collocated noise, and spatially segregated noise. Our results revealed that both infants and adults showed robust cortical tracking of speech across quiet and noisy listening conditions. For adults, spatial separation between the target speaker and distracting talkers led to enhanced cortical tracking of the target speech, consistent with SRM. Infants also showed SRM, with stronger tracking in segregated than collocated noise, although the effect was confined to a frontal-central region rather than broadly distributed across the scalp as in adults. These findings provide the first neurophysiological evidence that, although still immature, the developing brain can benefit from spatial cues in the first year of life. Together, these results add new insight into how the infant brain solves a fundamental perceptual problem - identifying a relevant voice in a noisy environment - using a mechanism that is evolutionarily grounded.",

    "title": "Cortico-basal ganglia dynamics of global and selective response inhibition in humans",
    "content": "Response inhibition is an important cognitive control mechanism, which enables flexible behavior by stopping inappropriate actions. Intracranial recordings across species have identified a neural circuit that implements response inhibition via the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia. However, this work has been limited to simple tasks, in which unequivocal, salient \"stop\"-signals require the inhibition of all ongoing responses. Notably, response inhibition in the real world is substantially different. Real-world response inhibition is selective: it occurs only after specific salient signals ( stimulus-selectivity) and stops only specific movements, while others continue ( response-selectivity). If and how the fronto-subthalamic system implements selective inhibition is largely unknown. Here, we recorded subthalamic local field potentials and scalp-EEG in humans performing a novel, selective inhibition task. Salient signals either required stopping all initiated responses (global inhibition), stopping only some responses (response-selective inhibition), or continuing all responses - i.e., ignoring the signal (which ensures stimulus-selectivity). All three signals initially triggered a common fronto-subthalamic inhibitory process, signified by a rapid increase in {beta}-burst activity. During global inhibition, subthalamic {beta}-bursting subsequently increased above baseline, persisting for over a second. During response-selective inhibition, this activity was delayed, which enabled a second bout of disinhibition and allowed appropriate responses to continue. Throughout this period, frontal cortical and subthalamic {beta}-band activity was tightly coupled. This shows that selective inhibition is implemented through rapid, context-dependent engagement and release of fronto-subthalamic inhibition. Moreover, subthalamic activity lasted substantially longer than assumed by classic behavioral-computational models. This supports recent theoretical models that assume protracted response inhibition during action-stopping.",

    "title": "Potential of EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation to improve source analysis in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy",
    "content": "Objective. Conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields is a promising method to reduce the uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) and combined EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis due to inter-individual variations of tissue conductivities. Approaches for skull conductivity estimation based on evoked potentials and fields have been proposed in several studies, but the current knowledge about their sensitivity towards uncertainties of other tissue conductivities and the effects on source analysis accuracy is insufficient. In this study, we analyze this sensitivity for EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation and to what extent skull conductivity estimation improves the EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Approach. We simulated EEG and MEG measurements of evoked brain activity and IEDs for randomly assigned tissue conductivities and performed EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation for the simulated measurements. Following, we performed EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of the simulated IEDs and compared the results with and without using the individually estimated skull conductivities. Main results. We find that EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation is more accurate than EEG skull conductivity estimation, especially when considering realistic noise levels, whereas the type of the evoked brain activity only had a minor influence on the accuracy of the conductivity estimation. Both EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation clearly improve source analysis accuracy for EEG and combined EEG/MEG source analysis, reducing the uncertainty of the source localization from a few centimeters to less than one centimeter for most sources. However, we find that the effect of the conductivity estimation is less pronounced for sources at the base of the brain. Significance. EEG and EEG/MEG conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields has the potential to become a valuable tool to reduce uncertainty in source analysis of IEDs, while it only requires little additional measurement effort.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "title": "Genetic diagnosis of three intellectually disabled individuals in a pedigree and insights into fragile X syndrome diagnosis",
    "content": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability (ID). However, its diagnostic rate needs to be improved by screening for specific populations. Here, we determined the genetic cause of three ID patients in the affected pedigree and derived diagnostic insights for FXS. Enrolled at Henan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital in April 2025, the family underwent multiple diagnostic tests. Whole-exome sequencing failed to detect causative variants\u2014consistent with its inability to identify dynamic trinucleotide repeat expansions. Expanded pedigree analysis showed the inheritance did not fit typical autosomal dominant/recessive or X-linked models. This raised suspicion of FXS. Trinucleotide repeat primed PCR with capillary electrophoresis (TP-PCR/CE) confirmed proband III-1 as an FXS full-mutation individual, and comprehensive FXS analysis (CAFXS) validated this result while identifying counselee III-2 as a female pre-mutation carrier. All three ID cases harbored FMR1 full-mutation, with ID severity correlating with CGG repeat length. Notably, the maternal pre-mutation carrier (152 CGG repeats) had offspring with variable repeat dynamics: full-mutation (427 repeats) and reduced pre-mutation (71 repeats in III-2). These findings confirm FXS as the ID etiology and emphasize the clinical necessity of FXS-targeted screening in ID families with atypical inheritance patterns.",

    "title": "Neural substrates of female sexual rejection: hypothalamic pathways to the periaqueductal gray",
    "content": "Selecting an appropriate behavioral response according to the internal state is essential for well-being. Across the reproductive cycle, fluctuating levels of sex hormones align female behavior with reproductive capacity by modulating neuronal circuits that express hormone receptors. Sex hormone receptor-expressing neurons present along the anterior-posterior axis of the ventrolateral region of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) are key regulators of female sexual behavior. While posterior progesterone receptor-expressing neurons of the VMHvl (pVMHvlPR+) are fundamental for female sexual receptivity during the receptive phase of the reproductive cycle, we have recently shown that anterior VMHvlPR+ (aVMHvlPR+) neurons are involved in rejection behavior when non-receptive. Here, we mapped the connectional architecture of aVMHvlPR+ neurons using viral tracing approaches. As expected, these neurons strongly project to several hypothalamic areas. Furthermore, consistent with previous reports, we show that aVMHvlPR+ neurons robustly project to several columns of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) along its anterior-posterior axis. Artificial activation of aVMHvlPR+ somas selectively recruits the dorsomedial PAG (dmPAG). Optogenetic activation of aVMHvlPR+ axons in the dmPAG partially recapitulates the rejection phenotype observed upon activation of aVMHvlPR+ somas, increasing the rate of rejections in receptive females. These findings reveal a putative pathway regulating female rejection behavior within a more complex circuit, ensuring that mating does not occur during non fertile periods.",

    "content": "How does the developing brain, initially equipped only with elementary mathematical intuitions, acquire higher mathematical concepts? Through a longitudinal functional MRI study of children from preschool through first and second grade, we tracked how neural responses to mathematical and non-mathematical statements change in the first two years of formal schooling and use the data to evaluate several theories of developmental change. Before school, when listening to math statements, children already engage an adult-like cortical network, with partial specialization for geometry. Over the first two years of school, we observe an overall increase in math-related activation, a small recruitment of additional neural territory, reduced activation for facts that get better known, and a small overall increase in the dimensionality of representational space. fMRI responses to individual sentences suggest that these mechanisms, particularly in left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral intraparietal sulcus, all contribute to children's growing mastery of mathematical concepts.",

    "title": "Medication and Developmental Stage Shape the Brain-Age Gap in ADHD",
    "content": "Identifying robust biomarkers for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) remains challenging. The brain-age gap (BAG), which is the difference between predicted biological brain age and chronological age, has been proposed as a marker of atypical neurodevelopment, yet findings have been inconsistent across studies, limiting its clinical translation. We hypothesized that two major sources of heterogeneity, medication status and developmental stage, contribute to these discrepancies. To test this, we analyzed structural MRI data from a large multi-site cohort (N = 947; ages 7-26 years). Individuals with ADHD were stratified by medication history (medicated vs. unmedicated) and developmental stage (childhood vs. adolescence) and compared with matched typically developing controls. We estimated global- and network-level BAG using publicly available pretrained models. Our results revealed that BAG differences were contingent on medication status, with abnormalities predominantly observed in unmedicated individuals. Developmental stage further moderated the presence of this effect: BAG abnormalities were present significantly in children with ADHD but not in adolescents. Network-level analyses demonstrated spatial specificity, with significant effects in visual, ventral attention, and dorsal attention networks. Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that BAG in ADHD is both medication- and development-dependent, highlighting the need to account for treatment exposure and developmental stage when evaluating BAG as a biomarker and further underscoring the importance of early intervention during childhood.",

    "title": "A computational neuroimaging account of impulsive premature decision-making",
    "content": "Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct with distinct implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of various neuropsychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders, behavioural addictions, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, psychosis, and personality disorders. One proposed behavioural subtype, premature responding impulsivity (PRI), appears to be influenced by neuromodulatory pathways frequently implicated in these disorders, in particular dopamine neurotransmission, known for its role in contingency learning. Still, the neurobiological basis of PRI in humans remains insufficiently understood. Here, we theorize that PRI reflects the brain's capacity to adapt to environmental uncertainty. To test this hypothesis, twenty-four healthy adults (mean age 22.6 years; 12 females) completed a novel decision-making task featuring alternating stable and volatile probabilistic cue contingencies while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A hierarchical Bayesian model estimated PRI as an urgency-to-respond process, whose parameters were dynamically modulated by volatility. These model-derived indices correlated with established trait impulsivity measures, supporting their construct validity. Model-based fMRI analyses identified a distributed cortico-subcortical network including anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and monoaminergic midbrain regions, whose activity tracked within-trial PRI estimates as they evolved over time. Connectivity analyses further showed that high volatility enhanced interactions between subnetworks typically associated with promoting or inhibiting impulsive action. Together, these results outline a neurocomputational account in which environmental uncertainty modulates PRI through interacting brain circuits, offering a principled framework for further probing the transdiagnostic role of impulsivity across neuropsychiatric and neuropsychopharmacological contexts.",

    "title": "Anterior cingulate cortex activation of claustrum projection neuron subtypes is enhanced by alcohol",
    "content": "Cognitive impairment is a major component of Alcohol Use Disorder. Optimal cognitive performance requires anterior cingulate input activation of the claustrum, a subcortical nucleus that orchestrates cortical activity. Yet the impact of chronic alcohol exposure on the ability for the anterior cingulate cortex to drive activity of claustrum projection neuron subtypes is unknown. In adult male and female mice, we found that the majority of non-burst firing Type 1 claustrum projection neurons did not express the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), while the majority of burst firing Type 2 projection neurons were VGLUT2-expressing. Following chronic intermittent vaporized ethanol exposure (CIE), we found that both Type 1 and VGLUT2-non-expressing neurons exhibited increased responsivity to anterior cingulate cortex input activation that was mediated by increased postsynaptic membrane excitability. In contrast, Type 2 and VGLUT2-expressing projection neurons exhibited increased responsivity to anterior cingulate cortex input due to strengthened pre- and post-synaptic transmission mechanisms. Altogether, we uncovered a hyper-excitatory drive of the claustrum by the anterior cingulate cortex following chronic alcohol exposure. The data provide a foundational resource for the complex effects of chronic alcohol exposure on the claustrum, a critical cognitive control nucleus.",

    "content": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modeling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of RS neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.",

    "title": "Predictive coding in psychopathology: mechanistic model or metaphorical re-description?",
    "content": "Predictive coding (PC) has become a central framework in contemporary cognitive neuroscience, proposing that the brain operates as a hierarchical inference system that continuously minimizes the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory input. Its extension into clinical neuroscience has been accompanied by considerable enthusiasm, yet attempts to translate its computational principles into explanations of psychiatric and neurological disorders have yielded uneven results. The present review critically examines the clinical applicability of PC across three diagnostic domains: schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and mood and anxiety disorders. Drawing on findings from neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and computational modeling, the discussion evaluates how disturbances in prediction error signaling, the precision weighting of sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs, and hierarchical inference have been proposed to relate to core clinical phenomena such as hallucinations, sensory hypersensitivity, and affective dysregulation. Particular attention is given to persistent theoretical tensions, including debates surrounding prior precision, the mapping between neural proxies and behavior, and the inconsistent use of PC terminology across diagnostic contexts. By adopting a structured and comparative approach, this review aims to clarify where predictive coding offers testable mechanistic insight into psychopathology, and where its explanatory scope remains limited or provisional.",

    "title": "A systematic review of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based task paradigms in stroke rehabilitation",
    "content": "Precision in assessing neurological function after stroke is key to optimizing the efficacy of rehabilitation. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides a highly ecologically valid assessment of cortical activation and functional reorganization after stroke by monitoring cortical hemodynamic changes during different tasks. However, the current fNIRS task paradigm lacks systematic integration for standardized design and clinical translation strategies, and fragmented evidence is difficult to converge into actionable practice guidelines. To fill this gap, this paper systematically reviews the application of fNIRS in motor, cognitive, language, and dual-task paradigms in stroke rehabilitation research. It reveals the clinical value of different paradigms for neurological function assessment and proposes adaptive task designs that fit the functional characteristics of patients with stroke. This study emphasizes the importance of personalized and ecological paradigms, providing a theoretical basis and practical reference for subsequent standardized research on fNIRS task paradigms and developing clinical application standards.",

    "content": "Objective. Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease best known for its defining motor symptoms. However, it is also associated with significant cognitive impairment at all stages of the disease, with many patients eventually progressing to dementia. Therefore, there exists a significant need to identify objective functional biomarkers that better predict and monitor cognitive decline. While methods that analyse either spontaneous or evoked electroencephalogram (EEG), due to increasing practical usability and ostensible objectivity, have been investigated, current approaches are limited in that the associated measures are, in the absence of a theoretical basis, purely correlative. Approach. To address this shortcoming, we propose calculating changes in evoked EEG amplitude variability, quantified using information theoretic differential entropy (DE), during a three-level passive auditory oddball task, as it is argued this will directly index functional changes in cognition. We therefore estimate changes in stimulus-evoked DE in cognitively normal PD participants (N = 25), both on and off their medication, and in healthy age-matched controls (N = 25), and find substantial stimulus (standard, target, novel) and group differences. Main results. Notably, we find the time-course of the return of post-stimulus reductions in DE (i.e. information processing) to pre-stimulus levels delayed in PD compared to healthy controls, thus mirroring the assumed bradyphrenia. The observed changes in DE, together with the corollary increases in resting alpha (8\u201313 Hz) band activity seen in PD, are explained in the context of a well-known macroscopic theory of mammalian electrocortical activity, in terms of reduced tonic thalamo-cortical drive. Significance. This method of task-evoked DE EEG amplitude variability is expected to generalise to any situation where the objective determination of cognitive function is sought.",

    "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
    "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

    "content": "Community detection is a crucial task in network research, applicable to social systems, biology, cybersecurity, and knowledge graphs. Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited significant representational capability; yet, they frequently experience instability and erroneous clustering, often referred to as \u201dhallucinations.\u201d These artifacts stem from sensitivity to high-frequency eigenmodes, over-parameterization, and noise amplification, undermining the robustness of learned communities. To mitigate these constraints, we present F2-CommNet, a Fourier\u2013Fractional neural framework that incorporates fractional-order dynamics, spectrum filtering, and Lyapunov-based stability analysis. The fractional operator implements long-memory dampening that mitigates oscillations, whereas Fourier spectral projections selectively attenuate eigenmodes susceptible to hallucination. Theoretical analysis delineates certain stability criteria under Lipschitz non-linearities and constrained disturbances, resulting in a demonstrable expansion of the Lyapunov margin. Experimental validation on synthetic and actual networks indicates that F2-CommNet reliably diminishes hallucination indices, enhances stability margins, and produces interpretable communities in comparison to integer-order GNN baselines. This study integrates fractional calculus, spectral graph theory, and neural network dynamics, providing a systematic method for hallucination-resistant community discovery.",

    "title": "Towards robust probabilistic maps in Deep Brain Stimulation: exploring the impact of patient number, stimulation counts, and statistical approaches",
    "content": "IntroductionProbabilistic Stimulation Maps (PSMs) are increasingly employed to identify brain regions associated with optimal therapeutic outcomes in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). However, their reliability and generalizability are challenged by the limited size of most patient cohorts and the inherent variability introduced by different statistical methods and input data configurations. This study aimed to investigate the geometrical variability of Probabilistic Sweet Spots (PSS) as a function of both the number of patients (nPat) and the number of stimulations per patient (nStim), and to model a stability boundary defining the minimum data requirements for obtaining geometrically stable PSS.MethodsThree statistical approaches\u2013Bayesian t-test, Wilcoxon test with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction, and Wilcoxon test with nonparametric permutation correction\u2013were applied to two patient cohorts: a primary cohort of 36 patients undergoing DBS for Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), and a secondary cohort of 61 patients treated for Essential Tremor (ET), used to assess generalizability. Stimulation test data was collected intra-operatively for the first cohort and post-operatively for the second one. Geometric stability was evaluated based on variability in PSS volume extent and centroid location.ResultsThe analysis revealed a non-linear trade-off between nPat and nStim to yield stable PSS. A stability boundary was defined, representing the minimum combinations of nPat\u2013nStim required for anatomically robust PSS. Among the tested methods, the Bayesian t-test achieved stability with smaller sample sizes (\u223c15 patients) and demonstrated a consistent performance across both cohorts. In contrast, the Wilcoxon-based methods showed variable behavior between cohorts, which differed in symptom type and testing phase (intra-operative testing vs. post-operative screening).DiscussionThe proposed PSS stability boundary provides a practical reference for designing DBS studies and stimulation screening protocols aimed at probabilistic mapping. The Bayesian t-test emerged as a reliable method across both cohorts, supporting its potential in studies with limited sample sizes and scenarios where the method needs to be readily generalized to varying symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of considering both cohort size and stimulation count in probabilistic DBS mapping and call for further investigation into method-specific sensitivities to clinical and procedural factors.",

As a common complication of cancer, CRCI significantly affects patients\u2019 quality of life. In recent years, the neurobiological mechanisms of CRCI have garnered widespread attention. Research indicates that cancer-related therapies lead to CRCI by affecting brain structure, function, metabolism, and blood perfusion. Various neuroimaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and electroencephalography (EEG), have been extensively employed to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of CRCI.

    "content": "Prosthetic knee joints are essential assistive technologies designed to replicate natural gait and improve mobility for individuals with lower-limb loss. This study presents a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of a two-degree-of-freedom prosthetic knee joint and introduces three robust nonlinear control strategies: Integral Sliding Mode Control, Conditional Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control, and Conditional Adaptive Positive Semidefinite Barrier Function-based Sliding Mode Control. These controllers are designed to address the challenges associated with nonlinear joint dynamics, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties during locomotion. To optimize control performance, the gain parameters of each controller were fine-tuned using Red Fox Optimization, a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the intelligent hunting behavior of red foxes. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov theory, and control effectiveness is evaluated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and validated via hardware-in-the-loop testing using a C2000 Delfino F28379D microcontroller. Among the three controllers, the CoBA-based approach demonstrated the highest tracking accuracy, fastest convergence, and smoothest torque profile. The close agreement between simulation and experimental results confirms the practical applicability of the proposed control framework, offering a promising solution for intelligent and adaptive prosthetic knee systems.",

    "title": "Seasonal blood-brain barrier plasticity links environmental cues to migratory behavior in monarch butterflies",
    "content": "Seasonal migration requires animals to reversibly switch behavioral states in response to environmental cues, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these transitions remain poorly understood. Monarch butterflies provide a powerful model, as Eastern North American populations undergo a long-distance southward migration in the fall followed by a cold-dependent reversal in flight orientation after overwintering each spring. Here, we show that cold exposure induces coordinated transcriptional changes in the monarch brain, marked by attenuated integrin-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Cold-exposed monarchs exhibit increased penetration of fluorescent markers into the brain, consistent with increased BBB permeability. Notably, our findings align with previous genomic evidence identifying collagen type IV alpha 1, a major ECM component, as a locus under divergent selection between migratory and non-migratory populations. Together, these results implicate seasonal modulation of BBB permeability as a mechanism linking environmental temperature to plastic migratory behavior and identify the BBB as a dynamic interface through which seasonal cues may reprogram neural function and behavior.",

    "content": "Accurate detection of impending collisions is essential for survival. While multiple subcortical pathways have been found in the detection of looming stimuli, the roles of top-down attention and consciousness in this process remains unclear. Using high-resolution fMRI, we investigated how top-down attention and conscious awareness influence the subcortical processing of collision trajectories in healthy participants and hemianopic patients with cortical blindness. In healthy participants, the superior colliculus (SC)-parabigeminal nucleus (PBGN)-amygdala pathway integrated binocular information for accurate detection of collision trajectories in the upper visual field, but only when participants were paying attention to the looming stimuli. On the other hand, for stimuli presented in the blind visual field of hemianopic patients, effective connectivity analyses revealed collision sensitivity in the SC-pulvinar and SC-ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathways, supporting automatic collision detection even in the absence of visual awareness. Together, these findings suggest that distinct subcortical pathways mediate collision detection in the human brain depending on the presence and absence of attention and conscious awareness.",

    "title": "Progranulin deficiency induces lipid droplet accumulation in microglia via a STAT3-GPAT3 axis",
    "content": "Heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) encoding gene GRN cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD), whereas homozygous GRN mutations lead to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). However, the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration due to PGRN deficiency remain unclear. In the aged brains or under neurodegenerative conditions, the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in microglia contributes to cellular dysfunction and pro-inflammatory responses, exacerbating neurodegenerative pathology. Here, we investigated how PGRN deficiency induces LD accumulation in microglia. We found that PGRN ablation significantly upregulated triglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3 (GPAT3), the first and rate-limiting enzyme for triacylglycerol biosynthesis, and increased LD formation in both Grn-/- BV2 microglial cells and Grn-/- mouse brains. Mechanistic study revealed that PGRN deficiency upregulates GPAT3 via stimulating signal transduction and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) signaling. Silencing Gpat3, inhibiting GPAT3 activity with the small molecule inhibitor FSG67, or PGRN restoration reduced LD accumulation and rescued the cytotoxicity of Grn-/- microglia conditional medium (MCM) toward N2a cells. Notably, intraperitoneal administration of FSG67 or AAV-MG1.2-mCx3cr1-mGrn-eGFP-mediated microglia-specific gene therapy reduced microglial LDs and ameliorated behavior phenotypes in Grn-/- mice. Our study elucidates the role of PGRN loss in microglial lipid homeostasis and identifies the STAT3-GPAT3 axis as a potential therapeutic target for LD-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "title": "Effects of violence on executive function: a neuropsychological and predictive analysis in victims of the armed conflict in Colombia",
    "content": "IntroductionExposure to violence has been associated with alterations in how the brain organizes thought, regulates emotions, and guides behavior. In Colombia, decades of armed conflict have generated heterogeneous patterns of cognitive vulnerability, yet evidence on executive and emotional functioning in adult victims remains limited.MethodsThis cross-sectional study compared executive and emotional functioning between victims and non-victims of the Colombian armed conflict. A total of 300 middle-aged adults from the Department of Bol\u00edvar were assessed using a neuropsychological battery (MMSE, Tower of Hanoi, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test, and Frontal Assessment Battery) and emotional screening instruments (GAD-7 and PHQ-2). Executive function was modeled as a latent construct using confirmatory factor analysis and Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Random Forest was implemented as a complementary, assumption-free analytic strategy.ResultsVictims showed significantly poorer performance in planning, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control (\u03b2 = \u20130.178; p = 0.024). Educational attainment emerged as the strongest predictor of executive functioning (\u03b2 = \u20130.249; p < 0.001). The factorial model showed modest fit (CFI = 0.76), reflecting ecological and educational heterogeneity. Machine learning analyses converged with latent-variable results, identifying exposure to violence and structural inequalities as the strongest predictors of executive variability, whereas emotional factors played a marginal role.DiscussionThe findings delineate a cognitive profile associated with conflict-related victimization, characterized by vulnerabilities in executive control processes. These results underscore the need for clinical and public policy interventions that integrate neuroscientific approaches to strengthen planning and decision-making capacities in populations affected by armed conflict.",

    "title": "The influence of class mobility on pain empathy among the wealthy in collectivist cultures: evidence from ERPs",
    "content": "IntroductionAs a privileged group within the social structure, the wealthy play a significant role in social philanthropy and public welfare initiatives, making their empathic capacity a subject of considerable interest. Previous research has found that wealthy individuals who have experienced upward class mobility paradoxically demonstrate reduced empathy toward the poor. However, these studies were predominantly conducted in individualistic cultural contexts, leaving the collectivist cultural perspective largely unexplored.MethodsThe present study employed a virtual-society paradigm to experimentally simulate class mobility in a collectivist context. Objective mobility direction (upward vs. horizontal) and subjective evaluation of mobility (positive vs. negative) were manipulated to construct four types of wealthy roles (upward-positive, upward-negative, horizontal-positive, horizontal-negative). Chinese university students from a collectivist cultural background were instructed to sequentially adopt each wealthy role and judge painful versus neutral pictures of the same low-status target, while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded.ResultsThe results revealed that in the early N2 component, under upward mobility conditions, pain stimuli elicited significantly smaller N2 amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli, while no significant difference was observed under horizontal mobility conditions. In positive evaluation conditions, pain stimuli evoked significantly smaller N2 amplitudes than neutral stimuli, whereas no significant difference emerged in negative evaluation conditions. For the late LPP component, pain stimuli consistently elicited significantly larger LPP amplitudes than neutral stimuli, regardless of either the objective direction of class mobility or subjective evaluation.DiscussionThese findings suggest that, within this simulated class-mobility context, upward mobility experiences and positive appraisal primarily influence early neural processing of the poor target\u2019s pain, while later evaluative processing remains relatively stable. This study provides neural-level evidence for understanding how class mobility affects pain empathy among the wealthy in collectivist cultures, thereby enriching research on the relationship between social stratification and pain empathy.",

    "content": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common neurological disorder that diminishes neuromotor control. Exercise training provides a nonpharmacological treatment option that may help motor symptom severity and trajectory. In the present case series, we assessed linear and non-linear measures of neuromotor control along with functional measures of mobility in six men living with PD across a year of multimodal exercise training. Our measurements encompassed mobility, balance, strength, and force control metrics and were captured at baseline as well as at defined intervals following exercise engagement. The results appear to indicate a favorable preservation of functional ability and neuromotor control for most of the cohort across the yearlong exercise intervention. Our linear measures of neuromotor control generally remained stable with slight improvements from baseline to month 12, with visually distinct trends for our non-linear measures (Sample Entropy) of neuromotor control suggestive of more adaptive motor control strategies for both postural and force control. These data corroborate reports showing favorable outcomes for people with Parkinson's Disease following exercise engagement. Our year-long assessment of neuromotor control in a cohort of men with Parkinson's disease provides a novel contribution to the trajectory of change in this population while undergoing multimodal exercise training.",

    "content": "Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) is a rare autosomal dominant leukodystrophy primarily caused by mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene, characterized by progressive cognitive and motor decline. We present a case of a 42-year-old Chinese woman with a rapidly progressive syndrome featuring prominent apathy, cognitive impairment, and hypoactivity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive confluent white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas grade 3) predominantly in frontal and parietal lobes, cerebral atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum. Comprehensive genetic testing identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the CSF1R gene (c.2342C\u202f>\u202fT, p.Ala781Val), located within the tyrosine kinase domain, confirming the Diagnosis of HDLS. This case highlights early apathy and hypoactivity as red-flag manifestations of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy in a 42-year-old woman with rapidly progressive cognitive decline. The atypical presentation, initially mimicking psychiatric or demyelinating disease, underscores the need to consider CSF1R sequencing when encountering early-onset cognitive or behavioral deterioration with unexplained white-matter changes, thereby facilitating timely diagnosis and genetic counseling.",

    "content": "BackgroundAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder frequently marked by poor treatment response and chronic progression toward rigid, restrictive behaviors. These features highlight the need for innovative strategies targeting core mechanisms and symptoms of the disorder. This feasibility trial evaluates individualized intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as an adjunct to treatment-as-usual, with the goal of identifying patient-specific targets and paving the way for personalized neuromodulation in AN.MethodsThirty-four adults with AN (\u226518 years, illness \u226512 months, \u22651 prior unsuccessful treatment) will be randomized (1:1) to 20 sessions of real or sham iTBS over 4 weeks. Stimulation will be delivered with a MagPro system and a Cool B70 A/P active/sham coil; motor threshold will be estimated with the Stochastic Approximator (SAMT) and re-checked weekly. Individualized stimulation target will be defined based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to identify the cortical region within the PPC that is maximally functionally connected with the activity of two meta-analytically derived networks representing body representation and implicit behavioral tendencies. Coil placement will be neuronavigated on individual T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Assessments will take place at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), and 4-month follow-up (T2), covering clinical status (body mass index (BMI), psychopathology, and quality of life), experimental tasks (implicit body representation, peripersonal space, approach\u2013avoidance tendencies toward food, interoceptive accuracy, and neurocognitive functioning), and MRI. Feasibility endpoints include recruitment, retention, completion, blinding, and tolerability. Ethics approval: 6168/EST/25; registration: NCT07106645.DiscussionThis trial emphasizes individualized PPC targeting and rigorous motor threshold (MT) estimation to advance personalized neuromodulation in AN. Feasibility and effect-size data will guide a confirmatory randomized clinical trial, while mechanistic analyses will test whether targeted iTBS strengthens body-schema circuits and aligns neural changes with clinical improvement, supporting a precision-psychiatry approach to eating disorders.Trail registrationhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07106645, identifier NCT07106645.",

It parses networks into an intermediate representation, measures per-layer information content using entropy, sensitivity, and redundancy, and computes an Information Density Metric (IDM) to guide optimizations such as adaptive mixed-precision quantization, structural pruning, and architecture-aware compression. By focusing on compressing the least informative components rather than applying uniform rules, ITC achieves high compression ratios with predictable accuracy, producing deployable models without retraining or teacher models, and integrates seamlessly into standard PyTorch workflows for inference.</p> <p><strong>The motivation:</strong><br /> Most optimization tools in ML (quantization, pruning, distillation) treat all parameters as roughly equal. In practice, they aren\u2019t. Some parts of a model carry a lot of <em>meaning</em>, others are largely redundant, but we don\u2019t measure that explicitly.</p> <p><strong>The idea:</strong><br /> ITC treats a neural network as an <strong>information system</strong>, not just a parameter graph. </p> <p><strong>Comparison with existing alternatives</strong></p> <p>Other ML optimisation tools answer:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cHow many parameters can we remove?\u201d</li> </ul> <p>ITC answers:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cHow much information does this part of the model need to preserve?\u201d</li> </ul> <p>That distinction turns compression into a compiler problem, not a post-training hack.</p> <p>To do this, the system computes per-layer (and eventually per-substructure) measures of:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Entropy</strong> (how diverse the information is),</li> <li><strong>Sensitivity</strong> (how much output changes if it\u2019s perturbed),</li> <li><strong>Redundancy</strong> (overlap with other parts),</li> </ul> <p>and combines them into a single score called <strong>Information Density (IDM)</strong>.</p> <p>That score then drives decisions like:</p> <ul> <li>Mixed-precision quantization (not uniform INT8),</li> <li>Structural pruning (not rule-based),</li> <li>Architecture-aware compression.</li> </ul> <p>Conceptually, it\u2019s closer to a <strong>compiler pass</strong> than a post-training trick.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>ITC is <strong>production-ready</strong>, even though it is <strong>not yet a drop-in production replacement</strong> for established toolchains.</p> <p>It is best suited for:</p> <ul> <li>Researchers exploring model compression, efficiency, or information theory</li> <li>Engineers working on edge deployment, constrained inference, or model optimization</li> <li>Developers interested in compiler-style approaches to ML systems</li> </ul> <p>The current implementation is:</p> <ul> <li>Stable and usable via CLI and Python API</li> <li>Suitable for experimentation, benchmarking, and integration into research pipelines</li> <li>Intended as a foundation for future production-grade tooling rather than a finished product</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lower_Painting1036\"> /u/Lower_Painting1036 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qipius/ive_been_working_on_an_informationaware_compiler/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qipius/ive_been_working_on_an_informationaware_compiler/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.11533v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Clinical psychology students frequently report feeling underprepared for the interpersonal demands of therapeutic work, highlighting the need for accessible opportunities to practise core counselling skills before seeing real clients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) now enable simulated interaction partners that may support early skills development. This study examined postgraduate clinical psychology students' perceptions of two AI-based simulations: a text-based chatbot (ChatGPT) and a voice-based avatar (HeyGen). Twenty-four students completed two brief cognitive-behavioural role-plays (counterbalanced), one with each tool, and provided both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on perceived usefulness, skill application, responsiveness and engagement, and perceived skill improvement. Both AI tools were evaluated positively across dimensions. However, the avatar was rated significantly higher than the chatbot for perceived usefulness, skill application, and perceived skill improvement, and qualitative comments highlighted the added value of voice-based interaction for conveying social and emotional cues. These findings suggest that AI-driven simulation may supplement early-stage clinical skills training, with voice-based avatars offering additional benefits. Future work should test whether such simulated interactions translate to objective improvements in real therapeutic performance.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.11531v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Manual creation of IT monitoring dashboard widgets is slow, error-prone, and a barrier for both novice and expert users. We present NOVAID, an interactive chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate IT monitoring widgets directly from natural language queries. Unlike general natural language-to-visualization tools, NOVAID addresses IT operations-specific challenges: specialized widget types like SLO charts, dynamic API-driven data retrieval, and complex contextual filters. The system combines a domain-aware semantic parser, fuzzy entity matching, and schema completion to produce standardized widget JSON specifications. An interactive clarification loop ensures accuracy in underspecified queries. On a curated dataset of 271 realistic queries, NOVAID achieves promising accuracy (up to 94.10% in metric extraction) across multiple LLMs. A user study with IT engineers yielded a System Usability Scale score of 74.2 for NOVAID, indicating good usability. By bridging natural language intent with operational dashboards, NOVAID demonstrates clear potential and a path for deployment in enterprise ITOps monitoring platforms.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.11530v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Young adults today face unprecedented mental health challenges, yet many hesitate to seek support due to barriers such as accessibility, stigma, and time constraints. Bite-sized well-being interventions offer a promising solution to preventing mental distress before it escalates to clinical levels, but have not yet been delivered through personalized, interactive, and scalable technology. We conducted the first multi-institutional, longitudinal, preregistered randomized controlled trial of a generative AI-powered mobile app (\"Flourish\") designed to address this gap. Over six weeks in Fall 2024, 486 undergraduate students from three U.S. institutions were randomized to receive app access or waitlist control. Participants in the treatment condition reported significantly greater positive affect, resilience, and social well-being (i.e., increased belonging, closeness to community, and reduced loneliness) and were buffered against declines in mindfulness and flourishing. These findings suggest that, with purposeful and ethical design, generative AI can deliver proactive, population-level well-being interventions that produce measurable benefits.",

However, LLM-based conversational agents suffer from spatiotemporal distortions when responding to variant user inputs, failing to maintain consistency with provided scenarios. We propose SNAP (Story and Narrative-based Agent with Planning), a framework that structures narratives into Cells with explicit Plans to prevent narrative drift in web environments. By confining context within each Cell and employing detailed plans that specify spatiotemporal settings, character actions, and plot developments, SNAP enables coherent and scenario-consistent dialogues while adapting to diverse user responses. Via automated and human evaluations, we validate SNAP's superiority in narrative controllability, demonstrating effective scenario consistency despite variant user inputs in web-based interactive storytelling.",

This study investigated how people evaluate advice on LLM-generated romantic relationships. Participants rated advice satisfaction, model reliability, and helpfulness, and completed pre- and post-measures of their general attitudes toward LLMs. Overall, the results showed participants' high satisfaction with LLM-generated advice. Greater satisfaction was, in turn, strongly and positively associated with their perceptions of the models' reliability and helpfulness. Importantly, participants' attitudes toward LLMs improved significantly after exposure to the advice, suggesting that supportive and contextually relevant advice can enhance users' trust and openness toward these AI systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.11526v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: LLMs are increasingly being deployed as chatbots, but today's interfaces offer little to no friction: users interact through seamless conversations that conceal when the model is drifting, hallucinating or failing. This lack of transparency fosters blind trust, even as models produce unstable or repetitive outputs. We introduce an interactive demo that surfaces and mitigates cognitive fatigue, a failure mode where LLMs gradually lose coherence during auto-regressive generation. Our system, Chatsparent, instruments real-time, token-level signals of fatigue, including attention-to-prompt decay, embedding drift, and entropy collapse, and visualizes them as a unified fatigue index. When fatigue thresholds are crossed, the interface allows users to activate lightweight interventions such as attention resets, entropy-regularized decoding, and self-reflection checkpoints. The demo streams live text and fatigue signals, allowing users to observe when fatigue arises, how it affects output quality, and how interventions restore stability. By turning passive chatbot interaction into an interactive diagnostic experience, our system empowers users to better understand LLM behavior while improving reliability at inference time.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.11525v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded their multimodal code generation capabilities, yet their ability to generate executable visualization code from plots, especially for complex 3D, animated, plot-to-plot transformations, or multi-library scenarios, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce PlotGen-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating plot-to-code generation under realistic and complex visualization scenarios. The benchmark spans 9 major categories, 30 subcategories, and 3 core tasks-plot replication, plot transformation, and multi-library generation, covering both 2D, 3D and animated plots across 5 widely used visualization libraries. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs, we find that open-source models still lag considerably behind in visual fidelity and semantic consistency, despite achieving comparable code executability. Moreover, all models exhibit substantial degradation on reasoning-intensive tasks such as chart type conversion and animation generation. PlotGen-Bench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing research toward more capable and reliable VLMs for visualization authoring and code synthesis, with all data and code available at https://plotgen.github.io.",

We introduce Clusters in Focus, an interactive visual analytics dashboard designed to address this gap. Clusters in Focus employs a three-panel coordinated view: a Data Panel offers multiple perspectives (tabular, heatmap, condensed with histograms / SHAP values) for initial data exploration; a Selection Panel displays the 2D clustering (K-Means/DBSCAN) for a user-selected feature pair; and a novel Cluster Similarity Panel featuring two switchable views for comparing clusters. A ranked list enables the identification of top-matching feature pairs, while an interactive similarity matrix with reordering capabilities allows for the discovery of global structural patterns and groups of related features. This dual-view design supports both focused querying and broad visual exploration. A use case on a Parkinson's disease speech dataset demonstrates the tool's effectiveness in revealing relationships between different feature pairs characterizing the same patient subgroup.",

With this growth comes a large volume of related data, prompting efforts like the PlayMyData to compile and share structured datasets for academic use. This study utilizes such a dataset to compare user review ratings across four current-generation gaming systems: Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Statistical methods, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), were applied to identify differences in average scores among these platforms. The findings indicate that PC titles tend to receive the most favorable user feedback, followed by Xbox and PlayStation, while Nintendo games showed the lowest average ratings. These patterns suggest that the platform on which a game is released may influence how players evaluate their experience. Such results may be valuable to developers and industry stakeholders in making informed decisions about future investments and development priorities.",

    "title": "Multifaceted neural representation of words in naturalistic language",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.13297v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how the brain represents the multifaceted properties of words in context is essential for explaining the neural architecture of human language. Here, we combine large-scale psycholinguistic modeling with naturalistic fMRI to uncover the latent structure of word properties and their neural representations during narrative comprehension. By analyzing 106 psycholinguistic variables across 13,850 English words, we identified eight interpretable latent dimensions spanning lexical usage, word form, phonology orthography mapping, sublexical regularity, and semantic organization. These factors robustly predicted behavioral performance across lexical decision, naming, recognition, and semantic judgment tasks, demonstrating their cognitive relevance. Parcel-based and multivariate fMRI analyses of narrative listening revealed that these latent dimensions are encoded in overlapping yet functionally differentiated cortical systems. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses further identified four interacting subsystems supporting sensorimotor grounding, controlled semantic retrieval, resolution of lexical competition, and contextual episodic integration. Together, these findings provide a unified neurocognitive framework linking fundamental lexical psycholinguistic dimensions to distributed cortical systems engaged during naturalistic language comprehension.",

    "title": "Polyphonic Intelligence: Constraint-Based Emergence, Pluralistic Inference, and Non-Dominating Integration",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.13182v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Across neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and related fields, dominant models of intelligence typically privilege convergence: uncertainty is reduced, competing explanations are eliminated, and behaviour is governed by the optimisation of a single objective or policy. While this framing has proved powerful in many settings, it sits uneasily with biological and adaptive systems that maintain redundancy, ambiguity, and parallel explanatory processes over extended timescales. Here we propose an alternative perspective, termed polyphonic intelligence, in which coherent behaviour and meaning emerge from the coordination of multiple semi-independent inferential processes operating under shared constraints. Rather than resolving plurality through dominance or collapse, polyphonic systems sustain multiple explanatory trajectories and integrate them through soft alignment, compatibility relations, and bounded influence. We develop this perspective conceptually and formally, introducing a variational framework in which multiple coordinated approximations are maintained without winner-takes-all selection. This formulation makes explicit how plurality can remain stable, tractable, and productive, and clarifies how polyphonic inference differs from ensemble methods, mixture models, and Bayesian model averaging. Through proof-of-principle examples, we demonstrate that non-dominating, pluralistic inference can be implemented in simple computational systems without requiring centralised control or global convergence. We conclude by discussing implications for neuroscience, psychiatry, and artificial intelligence, and by arguing that intelligence may be more fruitfully understood as coordination without command rather than as the elimination of uncertainty.",

Comp. 27 (2015), 1461--1495] proposed a model of a self-organizing neural network with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian synaptic updates that implements an algorithm for principal subspace analysis; however, global stability of the nonlinear synaptic dynamics has not been established. Here, for the case that the feedforward and recurrent weights evolve at the same timescale, we prove global stability of the continuum limit of the synaptic dynamics and show that the dynamics evolve in two phases. In the first phase, the synaptic weights converge to an invariant manifold where the `neural filters' are orthonormal. In the second phase, the synaptic dynamics follow the gradient flow of a non-convex potential function whose minima correspond to neural filters that span the principal subspace of the input data.",

Here, we propose a cognition space approach that replaces narrow, substrate-dependent definitions with a comparative representation based on organizational and informational dimensions. Within this framework, cognition is treated as a graded capacity to sense, process, and act upon information, allowing systems as diverse as cells, brains, artificial agents, and human-AI collectives to be analyzed within a common conceptual landscape. We introduce and examine three cognition spaces -- basal aneural, neural, and human-AI hybrid -- and show that their occupation is highly uneven, with clusters of realized systems separated by large unoccupied regions. We argue that these voids are not accidental but reflect evolutionary contingencies, physical constraints, and design limitations. By focusing on the structure of cognition spaces rather than on categorical definitions, this approach clarifies the diversity of existing cognitive systems and highlights hybrid cognition as a promising frontier for exploring novel forms of complexity beyond those produced by biological evolution.",

However, less is known about why such mechanisms are present in the first place. Theory suggests that primate decision making mechanisms, and their resultant behavioral abilities, emerged to maximize reward in the face of noisy, temporally evolving information. To test this theory, we trained an end-to-end deep recurrent neural network using reinforcement learning on a noisy perceptual discrimination task. Networks learned several key abilities of primate-like decision making including trading off speed for accuracy, and flexibly changing their mind in the face of new information. Internal dynamics of these networks suggest that these abilities were supported by similar decision mechanisms as those observed in primate neurophysiological studies. These results provide experimental support for key pressures that gave rise to the primate ability to make flexible decisions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.12424v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: For 20 years the beautiful structure in the grid cell code has presented an attractive puzzle: what computation do these representations subserve, and why does it manifest so curiously in neurons. The first question quickly attracted an answer: grid cells subserve path-integration, the ability to keep track of one's position as you move about the world. Subsequent work has only solidified this link: bottom-up mechanistic models that perform path-integration match the measured neural responses, while experimental perturbations that selectively disrupt grid cell activity impair performance on path-integration dependent tasks. A more controversial area of work has been top-down normative modelling: why has the brain chosen to compute like this? Floods of ink have been spilt attempting to build a precise link between the population's objective and the measured implementation. The holy grail is a normative link with broad predictive power which generalises to other neural systems. We review this literature and argue that, despite some controversies, the literature largely agrees that grid cells can be explained as a (1) biologically plausible (2) high fidelity, non-linearly decodable code for position that (3) subserves path-integration. As a rare area of neuroscience with mature theoretical and experimental work, this story holds lessons for normative theories of neural computations, and on the risks and rewards of integrating task-optimised neural networks into such theorising.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.12258v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A major goal of computational neuroscience has been to explain how the primate ventral visual stream (VVS) transforms visual input into temporally evolving neural representations that support robust visual perception. Historically, most modeling efforts have assumed static conditions: monkeys fixate a dot, images are briefly flashed, and neural responses are analyzed through time-averaged metrics. Feedforward deep networks trained on static object recognition tasks outperform prior work in approximating these static snapshot-driven VVS responses. However, mounting neurophysiological evidence demonstrates that VVS responses are rich dynamical signals shaped not only by the retinal input but also by intrinsic circuit dynamics, recurrent interactions, and widespread top-down modulation. Moreover, real-world vision is inherently dynamic: objects move, the observer moves, and the eyes actively sample the environment. Here, we review recent progress in modeling dynamic responses in the macaque ventral stream across three domains: (1) intrinsic dynamics elicited by static images, (2) dynamics evoked by dynamic visual stimuli, and (3) dynamics generated by active sensing during eye movements. We argue that accurately modeling VVS dynamics will require representational, circuit-level, and behavioral perspectives, including multi-area recurrence, structured E/I interactions, and temporal objectives that better reflect natural behavior. We outline some key missing ingredients and propose a roadmap toward dynamic, multi-timescale models of the primate VVS.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.12054v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how the brain integrates motor suppression with motivational processes remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. The rostral Pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem structure involved in motor control, has been shown to induce transient motor arrest upon optogenetic or electrical stimulation. However, our current understanding of its potential role in linking motor suppression with motivational or reinforcement-related processes is still insufficient. To further explore the effects induced by PPN stimulations and infer the potential mechanism underlying its role involved in both motor and emotional regulation, we developed a fully automated, low-cost system combining real-time animal tracking with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation, using the OpenMV Cam H7 Plus and embedded neural network models. The system autonomously detects the rat's position and triggers optical stimulation upon entry into a predefined region of interest, enabling unbiased, unsupervised behavioral assays. Optogenetic activation of CaMKIIa-expressing neurons in the rostral PPN reliably induced transient motor arrest. When stimulation was consistently paired with a specific location in a conditioned place preference task. When motor arrest was spatially paired with a defined region of interest, rats developed a robust place preference after limited training. These results suggest that rostral PPN activation can couple motor inhibition with reinforcement-related behavioral circuitry. Together, our work provides both a technical framework for scalable closed-loop neuroscience experiments and preliminary evidence that the rostral PPN may participate in coordinating motor suppression with motivational processes.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.12053v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While foundation models have achieved remarkable results across a diversity of domains, they still rely on human-generated data, such as text, as a fundamental source of knowledge. However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.11653v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI agents are increasingly used in long, multi-turn workflows in both research and enterprise settings. As interactions grow, agent behavior often degrades due to loss of constraint focus, error accumulation, and memory-induced drift. This problem is especially visible in real-world deployments where context evolves, distractions are introduced, and decisions must remain consistent over time. A common practice is to equip agents with persistent memory through transcript replay or retrieval-based mechanisms. While convenient, these approaches introduce unbounded context growth and are vulnerable to noisy recall and memory poisoning, leading to unstable behavior and increased drift. In this work, we introduce the Agent Cognitive Compressor (ACC), a bio-inspired memory controller that replaces transcript replay with a bounded internal state updated online at each turn. ACC separates artifact recall from state commitment, enabling stable conditioning while preventing unverified content from becoming persistent memory. We evaluate ACC using an agent-judge-driven live evaluation framework that measures both task outcomes and memory-driven anomalies across extended interactions. Across scenarios spanning IT operations, cybersecurity response, and healthcare workflows, ACC consistently maintains bounded memory and exhibits more stable multi-turn behavior, with significantly lower hallucination and drift than transcript replay and retrieval-based agents. These results show that cognitive compression provides a practical and effective foundation for reliable memory control in long-horizon AI agents.",

    "title": "Motor unit discharge properties are modestly influenced by menstrual cycle-related fluctuations in sex hormone concentrations",
    "content": "Concentrations of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), the main female sex hormones, exhibit large fluctuations across the menstrual cycle. Due to their receptors throughout the central nervous system, both hormones have the potential to influence motor function by influencing ionotropic and metabotropic inputs to motor pools, which can be estimated through the neural codes extracted from motor unit discharge patterns. To address key methodological limitations in prior menstrual cycle research on motor output, we established the Motor Units and Sex Hormones (MUSH) collaboration. The objective of this multi-site investigation was to determine whether endogenous fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone influence human motor unit activity. We hypothesized that motor unit discharge rates and persistent inward current (PIC)-related contributions to discharge would be greatest during the late follicular phase, when estradiol concentrations were highest. Fifty females completed a comprehensive protocol involving menstrual cycle and ovulation tracking, serum hormone measurement, and high-density surface electromyographic recordings during isometric contractions to quantify motor unit activity in the early follicular, late follicular, and mid luteal phases. After exclusion of 10 females with either atypical hormone concentration profiles or insufficient motor unit yield, 40 remained in the final analysis. There were significant changes in several motor unit discharge variables between menstrual cycle phases and significant associations with hormone concentrations. Increased estradiol was associated with higher peak discharge rates and ascending discharge rate nonlinearity, while increased progesterone was associated with higher peak discharge rates, more discharge rate hysteresis and ascending discharge rate nonlinearity. Despite reaching statistical significance, the magnitudes of these effects (i.e., effect sizes) were small. Overall, these findings indicate that fluctuations in sex hormones influence motor unit behavior, but the effects are subtle, highlighting the need for well-powered and methodologically rigorous menstrual cycle research.",

    "content": "The Calcitonin Related Polypeptide Alpha (Calca) gene is a source of four biologically active peptides with varied physiological roles. Alternative splicing of the Calca messenger RNA generates either prepro calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) or preprocalcitonin encoding transcripts. Proteolytic processing of preprocalcitonin generates procalcitonin, calcitonin and katacalcin. Calcitonin is a ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor calcitonin receptor (CALCR) while CGRP is a ligand for the CGRP receptor (CGRP1R) formed by the calcitonin receptor like receptor (CALCRL)receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) complex. Interestingly, procalcitonin too, is a ligand for the CGRP1R where it can antagonize CGRP. CGRP expression in taste neurons has been documented and is posited to regulate taste signaling. Single cell and bulk RNASeq of taste papillae revealed that the preprocalcitonin but not the CGRP transcript is expressed in Tas1r3- expressing type II taste cells, while Calcrl (but not Calcr) and Ramp1 are expressed in stem/progenitor and type I cells in the circumvallate papillae. The CGRP1R is also expressed by fibroblasts in the lingual mesenchyme. We confirmed this expression pattern using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), RNAScope and immunohistochemistry. qPCR of geniculate and nodose-petrosal ganglia revealed that both express Cgrp and CGRP1R subunit mRNAs, but not procalcitonin and Calcr. This interesting expression patterns suggests that procalcitonin and CGRP might reciprocally regulate the CGRP1R in taste cells and lingual fibroblasts and thereby influence taste signaling, taste cell regeneration and the taste microbiome.",

    "content": "Fast-conducting A{beta} slowly adapting type I low threshold mechanoreceptors (SAI-LTMRs) and A{beta} rapidly adapting type I (RAI-) LTMRs are critical for discriminative touch from glabrous skin. Recent studies used mouse genetic loss-of-function and optogenetic gain-of-function manipulations to determine that signals from these A{beta} LTMRs are integrated subcortically to build the cortical representation of touch. However, the precise influence of each subtype on downstream responses is unclear, in part because previous manipulations lacked the capacity to reproduce physiological firing patterns in individual A{beta} LTMR subtypes. Here, we took advantage of a fast variant of channelrhodopsin, CatCh, which enabled us to generate physiological spiking rates and patterns in either subtype while monitoring responses in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Doing so revealed that propagation of steady-state signals from sustained responses of A{beta} SAI-LTMRs to neural activity (spiking and local field potential) in S1 is dependent on synchronous activation of multiple A{beta} SAI-LTMRs. Asynchronous activation of the same A{beta} SAI-LTMRs rarely produced sustained responses in S1 measured at the level of single unit spiking as well as local field potentials. This suggests that the irregular firing patterns of A{beta} SAI-LTMRs during static indentations contribute to the preponderance of transient cortical responses. By contrast, both synchronous and asynchronous activation of multiple A{beta} RAI-LTMRs resulted in robust S1 responses. Overall, the temporal patterning and synchrony of activity within A{beta} LTMR subtypes govern how well their signals propagate through the ascending somatosensory system.",

    "title": "Neural correlation between swallowing motor imagery and execution: an EEG analysis",
    "content": "Objective. The relationship between swallowing motor imagery (MI) and actual swallowing remains unclear, leading to a lack of physiological basis for the application of swallowing imagery-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) paradigms in rehabilitation. This research explored the link between swallowing execution and imagery, aiming to optimize BCI applications for swallowing rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia. Approach. Thirty healthy participants performed swallowing MI and saliva swallowing tasks under video cues, and electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 64 channels and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the suprahyoid muscles were recorded. This study investigates swallowing onset detection using EMG, and explores neural dynamics during swallowing imagery and execution through EEG-based time\u2013frequency analysis, functional connectivity analysis, and nonlinear dynamic analysis (sample entropy (SampEn)). Main Results. The results revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the central region (CPz, CP1\u2013CP4) and parietal region (Pz, P1\u2013P4) for both swallowing MI and actual swallowing. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis indicated a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0102). The ERD phenomenon during swallowing imagery was more similar to that during the pharyngeal stage, with a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0139). Functional connectivity analysis revealed greater activation of the central region during swallowing imagery than during actual swallowing. In terms of SampEn, swallowing motor execution exhibited higher signal complexity and dynamic characteristics compared to imagery. Significance. This study highlights the similarity in neural activation between swallowing imagery and execution, particularly in the central and parietal regions, supporting the application of the swallowing imagery paradigm in these regions for rehabilitation. Further research is required to enhance BCI applications in swallowing disorders.",

    "title": "Spinal Mechanisms in Post-Activation Potentiation: Facilitation of Presynaptic Inhibition Contrasts H-Reflex Amplitude Reduction",
    "content": "This study investigated the spinal neural mechanisms underlying post-activation potentiation in ten healthy young males (21.9 {+/-} 4.8 years). Participants performed a 10-second maximal isometric plantarflexion, after which we measured twitch torque and assessed spinal excitability using the soleus H-reflex, D1 presynaptic inhibition and heteronymous Ia facilitation (HF). High-density surface EMG was decomposed to track single motor unit responses. The conditioning contraction increased twitch torque by 12.2 Nm (p < 0.001) immediately and returning to baseline within nine minutes. This mechanical potentiation was accompanied by a 29% reduction in H-reflex amplitude (p < 0.001), which recovered within three minutes. Paradoxically, neurophysiological indices of presynaptic inhibition, D1 and HF were significantly increased (D1: p<0.017; HF: p<0.001), resulting in spinal facilitation. Single MU analysis revealed increased discharge probability, particularly in higher-threshold units indicating overall spinal facilitation. These results demonstrate that post-activation potentiation involves a complex dissociation: H-reflex pathway inhibition along facilitation of presynaptic spinal mechanisms. This paradox can be explained by either post-activation depression (caused by depletion of neurotransmitter at the Ia motoneuron synapse) or muscle thixotropy, a contraction history-dependent decrease in muscle spindle sensitivity, which reduces the efficacy of the Ia afferent volley independently of spinal inhibitory mechanisms. Our findings highlight a dissociation between spinal presynaptic facilitation and the depressed H-reflex, underscoring the need for future studies to explicitly test the roles of post-activation depression and muscle thixotropy during post-activation potentiation.",

We hypothesized that neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) could underlie DPN progression. To address this question, we performed multi-omic evaluation on DRGs from otherwise healthy organ donors, donors with diabetes but no neuropathy, and donors with clinically diagnosed DPN. We discovered that the first stages of neurodegeneration begin early in diabetes before the onset of DPN, with Nageotte nodule formation accompanied by apoptotic gene expression and decreased proportion of specific populations of A-fibers in DPN with remodeling of non-neuronal cells. Our findings define DPN as a neurodegenerative disorder of the DRG, identify molecular markers of disease stage, and highlight the need for early intervention to prevent irreversible neurodegeneration.",

    "title": "Evaluating the reliability of functional near-infrared spectroscopy data in the context of a reasoning paradigm",
    "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable, motion-tolerant neuroimaging method particularly well suited for developmental and naturalistic research. To evaluate the utility of fNIRS for studying individual differences and longitudinal changes, we measured activation and functional connectivity during a relational reasoning task in young adults (N = 73). We sought to (1) establish whether fNIRS captures frontoparietal activation patterns consistent with prior fMRI studies using similar paradigms, (2) assess the effect of the amount of data (number of task blocks) on signal strength and precision, (3) assess the paradigm's measurement properties in the form of intra- and interindividual stability of activation and functional connectivity within and across testing sessions, and (4) examine whether grouping channels into anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) conferred benefits to the above. We observed robust task-evoked activation across lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, with effect sizes on par with prior fMRI studies. Generally, we observed diminishing returns in effect size and measurement precision beyond ~7 minutes. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability varied across metrics; while they were very low for a specific task contrast, they were extremely high for functional connectivity, confirming the robustness of channel- and ROI-level connectivity as a stable marker of functional architecture. Exploratory analyses supported prior observations of lower signal quality in participants with darker skin tones and hair, underscoring the need for inclusive methodological strategies. Together, these findings highlight key design considerations for optimizing longitudinal and individual-differences research on higher-level cognition, particularly in diverse and developmentally variable populations.",

    "content": "Nerve Injury-Induced Protein 1 (Ninjurin-1) is an adhesion molecule implicated in inflammation and tissue injury, yet its role in neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) remains poorly defined. Here, we identify Ninjurin-1 as a key mediator of immune activation and CNS infiltration in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE), a model of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Using flow cytometry, gene-expression profiling, and in vivo peptide blockade, we show that Ninjurin-1 is markedly upregulated on CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells during disease progression. Ninjurin-1 myeloid cells display a dual function, as both an adhesion molecule and a marker of inflammatory activation, characterized by increased antigen presentation, cytokine production, and transcriptional enrichment for genes regulating adhesion, migration, and innate immune signaling. Importantly, therapeutic blockade of Ninjurin-1 significantly reduced clinical severity, CNS immune infiltration, and demyelination in RR-EAE. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for Ninjurin-1 in myeloid-driven neuroinflammation and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for relapsing-remitting MS.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

    "title": "PD-1-Dependent Modulation of Sensory Neurons by a Staphylococcus epidermidis Lipoteichoic Acid Drives Analgesia",
    "content": "The immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, traditionally known for suppressing T-cell activation, is also expressed in peripheral sensory neurons where it limits excitability, but the physiological contexts in which neuronal PD-1 is engaged remain poorly defined. We previously identified a purified Staphylococcus epidermidis lipoteichoic acid analog (SELTA) that rapidly alleviates pelvic pain in mice. Here, we investigated whether SELTA functions as an exogenous activator of neuronal PD-1 and whether PD-1 is required for its analgesic effects. SELTA increased Pdcd1 transcripts and PD-1 protein in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and prostate-innervating sensory fibers, and colocalized with TLR2 at neuronal membranes where it enhanced PD-1 Y248 phosphorylation. In primary DRG cultures, SELTA suppressed ATP-evoked calcium responses, indicating reduced neuronal excitability. This effect was abolished by PD-1 neutralization but restored when neutralization was blocked by a PD-1 control peptide, demonstrating both PD-1 dependence and specificity. In male mice with chronic pelvic allodynia induced by experimental autoimmune prostatitis, intraurethral SELTA produced robust, concentration-dependent, and repeatable reductions in tactile hypersensitivity. Sensory neuron-specific PD-1 conditional knockout mice showed normal baseline behavior but failed to respond to SELTA, confirming that PD-1 expression in nociceptors is essential for SELTA-mediated analgesia. These findings identify SELTA as a commensal-derived activator of neuronal PD-1 signaling. Through TLR2 engagement, PD-1 phosphorylation, and suppression of excitatory calcium signaling, SELTA attenuates nociceptor activation and reduces pelvic pain. This mechanism highlights neuronal PD-1 as a modifiable checkpoint pathway and a promising non-opioid target for chronic pain therapy.",

The core is written in Zig with SIMD vectorization.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>astroz is an astrodynamics toolkit, including propagating satellite orbits using the SGP4 algorithm. It writes directly to numpy arrays, so there's very little overhead going between Python and Zig. You can propagate 13,000+ satellites in under 3 seconds.</p> <p>pip install astroz is all you need to get started!</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Anyone doing orbital mechanics, satellite tracking, or space situational awareness work in Python. It's production-ready. I'm using it myself and the API is stable, though I'm still adding more functionality to the Python bindings.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>It's about 2-3x faster than python-sgp4, far and away the most popular sgp4 implementation being used:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Library</th> <th align=\"left\">Throughput</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\">astroz</td> <td align=\"left\">~8M props/sec</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">python-sgp4</td> <td align=\"left\">~3M props/sec</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h1>Demo &amp; Links</h1> <p>If you want to see it in action, I put together a live demo that visualizes all 13,000+ active satellites generated from Python in under 3 seconds: <a href=\"https://attron.github.io/astroz-demo/\">https://attron.github.io/astroz-demo/</a></p> <p>Also wrote a blog post about how the SIMD stuff works under the hood if you're into that, but it's more Zig heavy than Python: <a href=\"https://atempleton.bearblog.dev/i-made-zig-compute-33-million-satellite-positions-in-3-seconds-no-gpu-required/\">https://atempleton.bearblog.dev/i-made-zig-compute-33-million-satellite-positions-in-3-seconds-no-gpu-required/</a></p> <p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/ATTron/astroz\">https://github.com/ATTron/astroz</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Frozen_Poseidon\"> /u/Frozen_Poseidon </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qif5o1/tracking_13000_satellites_in_under_3_seconds_from/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qif5o1/tracking_13000_satellites_in_under_3_seconds_from/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "m6A modification and prion-like domain proteins converge to dysregulate Neuronal RNA Granules in Alzheimer s disease",
    "content": "Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a deadly neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. It is associated with several dysregulated pathways, including axonal transport. The latter supplies synapses with several essential components, including proteins and mRNAs. A proportion of RNAs in neurons is transported from the soma to neuronal extensions along microtubules in highly organized structures, known as Neuronal RNA Granules (NRGs). NRGs have a heterogeneous composition of coding and non-coding RNAs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and components of translational machinery. In this study, we investigate the potential involvement of NRGs in AD pathogenesis, with a particular focus on the N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a key RNA modification, and prion-like domain (PrLD) proteins. Our in-silico analysis revealed that a significant portion of mRNAs in NRGs are likely to be highly methylated. Using transcriptomic data from AD brain, we identify dysregulation of key genes in the m6A-methylation pathway (METTL3, FTO, YTHDF2/3, eIF3m) as well as PrLD-containing proteins associated with NRGs (STAU2, YBX1). We further observe aberrant expression of m6A-methylated mRNAs within both NRGs and synapses. Gene Ontology analysis highlights disruptions in pathways related to NRGs and synaptic function. Together, our findings suggest that impaired NRGs homeostasis may represent a critical and previously underappreciated contributor to AD pathogenesis. By outlining the potential roles of m6A and PrLD proteins in regulating NRGs, this work offers a new conceptual framework to better understand AD and identify NRGs as a potential therapeutic target. Finally, we propose a working model illustrating how dysregulation of NRGs homeostasis may drive neurodegeneration in AD.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I've been working on a project called Dorsal for the last 18 months. It's a way to make unstructured data more queryable and organized, without having to upload files to a cloud bucket or pay for remote compute (my CPU/GPU can almost always handle my workloads).</p> <h1>What my Project Does</h1> <p>Dorsal is a Python library and CLI for generating, validating and managing structured file metadata. It scans files locally to generate validated JSON-serializable records. I personally use it for deduplicating files, adding annotations (structured metadata records) and organizing files by tags.</p> <ul> <li>Core Extraction: Out of the box, it extracts &quot;universal&quot; metadata (Name, Hashes, Media Type; things any file has), as well and format-specific values (e.g., document page counts, video resolution, ebook titles/authors).</li> <li>The Toolkit: It provides the scaffolding to build and plug in your own complex extraction models (like OCR, classification, or entity extraction, where the input is a file). It handles the pipeline execution, dependency management, and file I/O for you.</li> <li>Strict Validation: It enforces Pydantic/JSON Schema on all outputs. If your custom extractor returns a float where a string is expected, Dorsal catches it before it pollutes your index.</li> </ul> <p>Example: a simple custom model for checking PDF files for sensitive words:</p> <pre><code>from dorsal import AnnotationModel from dorsal.file.helpers import build_classification_record from dorsal.file.preprocessing import extract_pdf_text SENSITIVE_LABELS = { &quot;Confidential&quot;: [&quot;confidential&quot;, &quot;do not distribute&quot;, &quot;private&quot;], &quot;Internal&quot;: [&quot;internal use only&quot;, &quot;proprietary&quot;], } class SensitiveDocumentScanner(AnnotationModel): id: str = &quot;github:dorsalhub/annotation-model-examples&quot; version: str = &quot;1.0.0&quot; def main(self) -&gt; dict | None: try: pages = extract_pdf_text(self.file_path) except Exception as err: self.set_error(f&quot;Failed to parse PDF: {err}&quot;) return None matches = set() for text in pages: text = text.lower() for label, keywords in SENSITIVE_LABELS.items(): if any(k in text for k in keywords): matches.add(label) return build_classification_record( labels=list(matches), vocabulary=list(SENSITIVE_LABELS.keys()) ) </code></pre> <p>^ This can be easily integrated into a locally-run linear pipeline, and executed via either the command line (by pointing at a file or directory) or in a python script.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li>ML Engineers / Data Scientists: Dorsal lets you make sure all of your output steps are validated, using a set of robust schemas for many common data engineering tasks (regression, entity extraction, classification etc.).</li> <li>Data Hoarders / Archivists: People with massive local datasets (TB+) who like customizable tools for deduplication, tagging and even cloud querying</li> <li>RAG Pipeline Builders: Turn folders of PDFs and docs into structured JSON chunks for vector embeddings</li> </ul> <h1>Links</h1> <ul> <li>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/dorsalhub/dorsal\">https://github.com/dorsalhub/dorsal</a></li> <li>PyPI: pip install dorsalhub</li> <li>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.dorsalhub.com\">https://docs.dorsalhub.com</a></li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Feature</th> <th align=\"left\">Dorsal</th> <th align=\"left\">Cloud ETL (AWS/GCP)</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Integrity</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Hash-based</td> <td align=\"left\">Upload required</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Validation</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">JSON Schema / Pydantic</td> <td align=\"left\">API Dependent</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Cost</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Free (Local Compute)</td> <td align=\"left\">$$$ (Per Page)</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Workflow</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Standardized Pipeline</td> <td align=\"left\">Vendor Lock-in</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Any and all feedback is extremely welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AverageMechUser\"> /u/AverageMechUser </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qi3zwa/i_built_a_localfirst_file_metadata_extraction/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qi3zwa/i_built_a_localfirst_file_metadata_extraction/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Phase similarity between similar objects indicates representational merging across retrieval training but not sleep",
    "content": "Retrieval training (i.e., cued recall) is theorised to induce rapid memory consolidation, similarly to sleep. Across consolidation, related neural representations become increasingly similar; yet, this representational change has never been directly compared between sleep and retrieval training. In this study, 30 subjects (27F, 18-34, M=22.17) completed four separate sessions in which they (1) learnt object-word pairs, followed by (2) immediate recognition testing, (3) one of four 120-min interventions (retrieval training, restudy, sleep, or wake), and (4) delayed recognition testing. We compared EEG phase similarity between similar and different objects to assess the time, frequency, and anatomical distribution of representational similarity across encoding (learning to immediate recognition), and each intervention (immediate to delayed recognition). We hypothesised that EEG phase patterns for similar objects would become more similar (i.e., representational merging) across retrieval training and sleep interventions, and predict a greater endorsement of similar-object lures. Indeed, we found increased representational similarity between similar objects across the encoding shift in the theta-band and occipital sources. Crucially, additional representational merging was only observed across the retrieval training intervention, in the alpha-band and parieto-occipital sources. Despite retrieval training leading to reduced performance in discriminating similar-objects lures, greater representational merging across retrieval training predicted greater discrimination of similar-object lures. Together, these findings suggest that sleep and retrieval training induce different memory transformations across the same timescale. Retrieval training may generally provoke rapid gist extraction, with greater neocortical integration supporting episodic discrimination. Conversely, sleep may selectively maintain task-relevant episodic and semantic details in the short-term.",

    "title": "Sleep dynamics and epileptogenesis following Kainic acid in epilepsy-susceptible (DBA/2J) and epilepsy-resistant (C57BL/6) mice",
    "content": "Susceptibility to epileptogenesis varies in humans and outbred mouse strains. We hypothesized that baseline sleep abnormalities increase susceptibility to epileptogenesis following Kainic acid (KA) and abnormal circadian rhythm or sleep homeostasis (SH) contribute to worse seizures in epilepsy-susceptible DBAs. Following EEG electrode implantation, C57 and DBA mice underwent repeated low-dose KA or saline treatment. Seizures, interictal spikes and sleep were examined over 8-weeks with continuous electroencephalography (EEG). Seizures were manually scored, and interictal spikes and sleep were analyzed using machine learning algorithms. Slow wave activity (SWA) was derived from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep following Fourier transform, and SH was measured by the decay of SWA during sleep and its rise with preceding wakefulness. The impact of post-KA seizures on circadian rhythm was determined using Cosinor analysis. Seizures were longer and more frequent in KA-treated DBAs than C57s. Interictal spike were much greater in saline-treated DBAs than C57s. SWA across the 24-hours was lower in DBAs at baseline. KA treatment decreased REM and increased SWA activity in DBAs but not in C57s. Cosinor analysis revealed circadian rhythm abnormalities in DBAs but not in C57s. Seizures impaired SH in DBAs, with no increase in SWA with preceding wakefulness and a progressive loss of SWA decay during lights-on over the 8-week recording. These findings suggest that baseline sleep abnormalities, poorly adaptable circadian rhythms and impaired SH are associated with increased vulnerability to epileptogenesis. Therapies enhancing circadian rhythm and SH after an insult may be avenues to mitigate epileptogenesis in vulnerable populations.",

    "title": "FPmotion an Automated Signal Processing and Statistical Analysis Tool for Fiber Photometry Data",
    "content": "Fiber photometry measures neural activity in vivo from genetically encoded indicators. Recordings generate large datasets that require extensive preprocessing and robust statistical methods for meaningful interpretation. However, existing analysis tools demand programming expertise, limiting accessibility. Here we describe FPmotion, a comprehensive, user-friendly software platform for batchwise processing, integration, and statistical analysis of fiber photometry data with or without accompanying behavioral information. FPmotion performs filtering, isosbestic regression, dF/F computation, detrending, and z-scoring. It also extracts detailed peak properties at whole-file, block-level, and individual-peak resolution. When behavioral data is provided, FPmotion automatically identifies behavioral bouts, computes bout-level statistics, performs peri-event signal extraction, and supports multi-group comparisons through ANOVA- and LMEM-based statistical frameworks. All analyses generate publication-ready figures and structured CSV outputs suitable for downstream workflows. FPmotion also introduces a dedicated alignment module for peri-event signal analysis. This module applies dynamic time warping followed by barycenter averaging to realign peri-event traces while preserving the behavioral time anchor, producing cleaner and more temporally coherent peri-event motifs. We demonstrate the capabilities of FPmotion software using the dlight1.1 sensor to measure dopamine responses from ventral striatum in behaving mice before and after amphetamine treatment. Together, FPmotion offers a fully automated framework for FP data analysis that improves interpretability and accessibility while reducing analysis time substantially.",

    "title": "Persistent impairment of spatial hearing and neural binaural interaction after temporary noise-induced hearing loss",
    "content": "Many people have trouble understanding speech in noisy environments despite normal audiometric thresholds, a condition referred to as hidden hearing loss. A leading hypothesis attributes this deficit to inner hair cell synaptic pathology (cochlear synaptopathy), which can persist after recovery from noise-induced temporary elevation of audiometric thresholds. This pathology impairs the temporally precise sound encoding necessary for spatial hearing, but direct evidence in primates, human or nonhuman, is lacking. Here, we show that a single noise exposure, producing only a temporary threshold elevation, induced long-lasting alterations in synaptic morphology, without synapse loss, resulting in persistent spatial hearing deficits for up to 11 months post-exposure in nonhuman primates of both sexes. These perceptual deficits were accompanied by a reduction in a neurophysiological measure of binaural processing - the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the auditory brainstem response (ABR). Both behavioral and neural deficits persisted despite full recovery of audiometric thresholds. Together, these findings provide the first evidence in primates that noise exposure disrupts spatial hearing and binaural neural circuit function without loss of hair cells or synapses. Because spatial hearing tests and the ABR/BIC are clinically accessible, this work also establishes translational biomarkers for early neural dysfunction underlying hidden hearing loss.",

    "title": "Multiple-Context Training Enhances Generalization of Cued Fear Extinction and Requires the Dorsal Hippocampus",
    "content": "BACKGROUND: Multiple-session fear extinction (FE) models exposure therapy, which also occurs over many sessions. In humans, conducting extinction training across multiple contexts improves fear suppression as compared to a single context, but rodent work delineating boundary conditions and neural mechanisms remains sparse. METHODS: We compared single-context FE (SCFE) versus multiple-context FE (MCFE) in 129S1 and C57BL/6J mice, manipulating context familiarity (familiar vs novel FE contexts). Outcomes included FE acquisition and tests for fear relapse such as recent (2 d) and remote (30 d) recall in trained, extinction, and novel contexts, as well as reinstatement tests. We mapped extinction-related neural activity with dual Fos labeling (TRAPxFos immunofluorescence) and graph analyses of regional co-activation, and used chemogenetic inhibition to selectively silence dorsal (dHP) or ventral hippocampus (vHP) during extinction. RESULTS: MCFE produced greater across-session reduction in freezing than SCFE. The MCFE advantage did not require contextual novelty. MCFE also enhanced short- (2 d) and long-term (30 d) recall in a novel context, but did not prevent recovery over time or US-induced reinstatement. Dual-labeling revealed that MCFE strengthened hippocampal-prefrontal co-activation (with relatively weaker prefrontal-amygdala coupling than SCFE). Chemogenetic silencing of dHP, but not vHP, selectively impaired between-session extinction under MCFE and abolished the MCFE benefit; hippocampal silencing did not improve SCFE. CONCLUSIONS: Conducting extinction across multiple contexts enhances acquisition and recall relative to SCFE, without requiring novelty, and engages distinct hippocampal-prefrontal circuit dynamics. dHP activity is necessary for the MCFE-specific improvement, highlighting a circuit mechanism in which distributing extinction across contexts augments fear reduction.",

    "title": "Cortical plasticity of the tactile mirror system in borderline personality disorder",
    "content": "Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) show alterations in empathic abilities, potentially involving automatic simulation processes supported by mirror-like mechanisms in the somatosensory domain. Within the tactile mirror system (TaMS), observing touch on another person's body activates cortical regions involved in tactile perception, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Although mirror-like alterations have been suggested in BPD, the underlying mechanisms of plasticity remain underexplored. Here, we used a cross-modal paired associative stimulation (cm-PAS) protocol to investigate the plasticity mechanisms of TaMS functioning in BPD. Twenty-four individuals with BPD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Empathic abilities were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Participants performed tactile acuity and visuo-tactile spatial congruity (VTSC) tasks before and after a cm-PAS protocol. During cm-PAS, images of a hand being touched were paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the S1. The effects of cm-PAS were assessed on tactile acuity, as an index of S1 activity, and VTSC performance, as an index of TaMS functioning. Preregistered analyses revealed that patients with BPD tended to have lower cognitive empathy than HCs, with no significant cm-PAS effects on tactile acuity or VTSC performance in HCs, precluding between-group comparisons of plasticity effects. Exploratory analyses indicated notable interindividual variability. In HCs, baseline performance predicted cm-PAS-induced changes, and higher cognitive empathy was associated with stronger VTSC interference; this pattern was inconsistent in patients with BPD despite comparable baseline measures. These findings highlight substantial interindividual variability in cm-PAS effects and a disrupted relationship between cognitive empathy and TaMS functioning in BPD.",

    "title": "Long-term Effects of Early Life Adversity On Brain Dopamine and Serotonin Receptor Systems Involved In Cocaine Reinforcement In Adult Macaques: a Positron Emission Tomography study",
    "content": "Early life adverse (ELA) experiences such as child maltreatment (MALT) are associated with physical and mental illness, including substance use disorders (SUDs), but underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study examined long-term effects of infant MALT on adult brain serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) receptors in corticolimbic regions involved in reward and emotional control, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, a translational infant MALT macaque model of cocaine use disorder (CUD) risk and a COC self-administration (SA) paradigm. The study focused on regional serotonin 5HT1A, 5HT2A, and dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability (BP) differences between MALT and Control animals using PET, both at baseline (pre-COC SA) and following chronic COC SA (once they reached a total of 100 mgCOC/kg bodyweight intake). We also examined whether levels of these neurochemical receptors predicted COC SA measures, including reinforcing properties and potency using fixed-ratio (FR) peak response rates (RR) and progressive-ratio (PR) peak breakpoint. Our findings showed long-term effects of infant MALT on 5HT, but not DA, receptors in corticolimbic circuits. Specifically, MALT animals showed lower 5HT1A BP in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and hippocampus compared to Controls. A MALT by Sex interaction effect was detected in 5HT2A BP in the OFC, with lower levels in MALT than Control males, but not in females. In addition, upregulation of 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors was detected following chronic COC SA in most PFC subregions, hippocampus, and NAcc, particularly in the Control group. These findings suggest long-term effects of ELA on adult 5HT, but not DA, receptors in corticolimbic regions involved in emotional and reward processes. We also found associations between PET baseline (pre-COC SA) receptor BP data and COC SA measures; in particular, a positive correlation between 5HT1A receptor BP in caudate and FR Response Rates, whereas amygdala 5HT1A receptor levels were positively correlated with PR peak breakpoint and negatively correlated with and FR Response Rates. Overall, these findings suggest an important role of 5HT1A and 5HT2A PFC receptors in early COC-related changes in reward circuitry and of amygdala 5HT receptors on reward motivated behaviors. The dynamic change of these 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors following chronic COC exposure was blunted in animals with ELA. It would be important to understand the biological consequences of the dynamic changes in these 5HT receptors and whether they predict risk for COC relapse and can inform future pharmacological interventions that target 5HT receptors for treatment of CUD.",

    "title": "Multilayer Network Modelling of the Human Reading System",
    "content": "Reading is supported by rapid and flexible coordination of neural activity across distributed brain regions. We have previously shown that left fusiform gyrus (FusG) provides a bridge flexibly linking the visual form analysis required for reading with the language system. Here, we investigate the dynamic organisation of an extending reading network encompassing classical perisylvian language areas and FusG. We do so by applying multilayer network modelling to language fMRI data acquired through the Australian Epilepsy Project, using a paradigm that contrasts reading with visuospatial judgements. The dataset included 201 participants with left dominant language, both with and without seizure disorders. We hypothesised that the relative strength of dynamic interactions within this extended language network is associated with reading ability. Time resolved functional connectivity was estimated using a sliding window Pearson's correlation approach, and the resulting connectivity matrices were entered into a multilayer community detection algorithm to quantify spatiotemporal community structure within the reading network. We concentrate our analyses on allegiance, the probability that a pair of regions is assigned to the same community over time. Our results show that community structure within the reading network is characterised by a preference for within hemisphere assignment over cross hemisphere assignment, as well as higher nodal allegiance among left language regions compared with their right hemisphere homologues. As anticipated, within versus between network allegiance followed a similar gradient in both language and attention networks: lowest between left language and right attentional regions, intermediate between the left FusG and each respective network, and highest within-network (left language or right attention). Importantly, as hypothesised, reading ability was associated with FusG-inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) interactions: higher left FusG-left IFG allegiance correlated with better reading performance, whereas increased right FusG-left IFG allegiance correlated with poorer reading. These findings highlight hemispheric asymmetries in the dynamic organisation of the reading system and provide novel evidence linking individual differences in reading ability to network level dynamics. Our findings align with a developmental literature suggesting that as reading proficiency improves, there is a shift from bilateral to unilateral left occipitotemporal engagement.",

    "title": "Latent biophysical diffusion properties underlying cerebral microstructure revealed through multimodal MRI covariation in the squirrel monkey",
    "content": "Diffusion MRI provides multiple quantitative descriptors of neural tissue derived from distinct physical and biophysical models, each probing different aspects of cerebral microstructure. While these metrics are often interpreted independently, their joint statistical structure may encode information about latent biophysical properties that constrain and organize brain microarchitecture. Here, we investigate whether stable patterns of multimodal diffusion MRI covariation reveal underlying biophysical diffusion properties of cerebral microstructure in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). Using a high-resolution multimodal diffusion MRI dataset acquired at 11.7T (400 m isotropic resolution) from 15 adult subjects, we analyzed tensor-based metrics alongside advanced multicompartment and axonal models, including NODDI and ActiveAx. Voxelwise and region-level correlation analyses were performed across multiple spatial scales to examine the structure, redundancy, and stability of relationships among diffusion-derived maps. We show that metrics originating from conceptually distinct models consistently organize into a low-dimensional structure characterized by stable clusters of covariation, robust to changes in parcellation and spatial aggregation. These patterns cannot be explained by trivial metric redundancy alone, but instead suggest convergence toward a reduced set of effective biophysical degrees of freedom governing diffusion behavior in neural tissue, including axonal organization, neurite density, orientation dispersion, and isotropic diffusion components. We interpret these covariation structures as manifestations of latent biophysical diffusion properties, emergent tissue states that are not directly observable through any single metric but become apparent through their structured relationships. From a systems neuroscience perspective, the stability of these latent dimensions supports the view that adult cerebral microstructure reflects the steady-state outcome of neurodevelopmental dynamics operating under biophysical constraints. Rather than providing a regional atlas, this work proposes a conceptual framework for interpreting multimodal diffusion MRI as a projection of an underlying low-dimensional biophysical state space organizing cerebral microstructure in primate brains.",

    "title": "Dopamine signatures of excessive and compulsive cocaine and fentanyl use",
    "content": "Excessive and compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences is a hallmark of substance use disorder, yet individuals differ markedly in their vulnerability to develop these behaviors. Drugs of abuse are long known to alter endogenous dopamine (DA) signaling, but shared principles for how DA dynamics impact compulsive use among individuals and across drug classes are lacking. Here, we monitored DA release in the medial shell of nucleus accumbens (NAc) during cocaine and fentanyl self-administration, with or without coincident punishment, in large cohorts of mice. Contingent cocaine and fentanyl self-administration evoked complex and individually distinct DA dynamics; nevertheless, a robust negative correlation held across both drugs, such that high takers exhibited lower drug-evoked DA signals. During punished drug taking, cocaine and fentanyl cases were associated with distinct DA signatures of compulsivity. For cocaine, punishment-resistant mice showed lower sustained DA responses during the post-shock, drug-associated cue period, whereas for fentanyl, punishment-resistant mice displayed larger phasic DA at the co-occurrence of footshock and drug infusion. To identify common principles underlying these observations, we developed a computational model grounded in an Actor-Critic temporal-difference (TD) learning framework that incorporates internal states, agent's uncertainty, and drug-specific effects. Remarkably, this model captures the observed diversity in DA dynamics across drug classes and among mice with variable drug taking propensities, hereby providing a unified interpretation of NAc DA signals as encoding TD reward prediction errors.",

    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

But as the OSF supports a nested folder structure, you might miss a\nfolder, and you will quickly end up with \u2018osfstorage-archive (1).zip\u2019, \u2018osfstorage-archive\n(2).zip\u2019, etc. Unzipping these archives creates a lot of files without the\norganized folder structure, in folders with meaningless names, making it\ndifficult to understand where files are. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">The\nosf_file_download function in Papercheck </span></b></h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">We have added\na new function to our R package \u2018<a href=\"https://scienceverse.github.io/papercheck/\">Papercheck</a>\u2019 that will download all files and\nfolders in an OSF repository.

In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "External disturbances to the body are better counteracted when their nature can be predicted in advance. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms through which probabilistic predictions shape feedback responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. We show that, prior to a mechanical perturbation applied to a finger, the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices receive a signal that linearly encodes the expected sensory input. When perturbations reach these areas, expectations are combined with the sensory input through a simple additive mechanism, yielding motor commands that reflect a weighted sum of the two signals. At the same time, M1 and S1 receive a prediction error signal, likely from upstream regions, encoding the difference between expectations and actual sensory input. This signal is visible in fMRI data in humans and in the local field potentials in non-human primates, but not in M1-S1 spiking activity.",

    "title": "Persistent Hypersensitivity after Repeat Concussion is Associated with Chronic Cognitive Dysfunction",
    "content": "Persistent sensory hypersensitivity is a common but under-recognized feature of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and may contribute to chronic cognitive complaints. However, the mechanistic relationship between long-term sensory dysregulation and cognitive dysfunction after repeat concussion remains poorly understood. Here, we used a preclinical repeated closed-head injury (rCHI-5x), in young adult mouse model targeting the frontal cortex at 8weeks of age to test whether chronic sensory processing abnormalities contribute to cognitive impairment under increased sensory load chronically at 8-10weeks post-injury (4months old). rCHI mice exhibited significant sensory dysfunction across multiple modalities compared to sham anesthetic controls, including increased tactile sensitivity, tactile avoidance, and impaired habituation to auditory startle, despite the absence of gross structural brain damage and preserved learning and memory under low-demand conditions. While spatial learning and working memory in the Barnes maze were intact, rCHI mice displayed increased perseveration and reduced cognitive flexibility. However, these cognitive deficits emerged only when auditory and tactile sensory distractors were introduced during testing, unmasking impairments that were not evident under baseline conditions. Within-animal analyses revealed strong associations between the severity of sensory hypersensitivity, impaired sensory habituation, and deficits in cognitive flexibility, relationships in rCHI mice but not in sham controls. These findings demonstrate that chronic sensory dysregulation following repeat mild concussion is not merely a secondary symptom, but can be a mechanistic contributor to cognitive impairment under conditions of elevated sensory load. Together, this work identifies persistent sensory processing and gating dysfunction as a key driver of PCS-related cognitive deficits and reveals that targeting sensory circuitry for therapeutic neuromodulation may offer functional rescue across multiple domains, extending beyond sensory symptoms to improve higher-order cognitive performance.",

    "content": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a powerful, non-invasive window into white matter (WM) development. Yet, most existing processing pipelines are not well-suited to the rapidly evolving neurophysiology of the pediatric brain. Here, we introduce sf-pediatric, a scalable, end-to-end, age-adaptable dMRI pipeline that integrates normative models of brain diffusivities to enable optimal subject-specific analysis from birth through 18 years old. Leveraging normative trajectories derived from nearly 2,000 participants from six cohorts, sf-pediatric dynamically calibrates diffusion priors, template selection, segmentation, and WM atlases based on the subject's age. By incorporating automatic quality control into a portable, tested, containerized, open-access, and press-button framework across computing environments, sf-pediatric provides a robust pipeline for large-scale pediatric dMRI studies. We validated this approach by showing improved local modeling and cortical fanning while preserving reproducibility and the ability to derive brain-behavior relationships. Additionally, we demonstrated robust recovery of known developmental trajectories of WM microstructure and connectome-derived network organization.",

    "title": "Connexins are essential for the contribution of latent progenitors to self-repair after spinal cord injury",
    "content": "Gap junctions are important regulators of the biology of neural stem cells. Both in vertebrates with regenerative abilities and neonatal rodents, ependymal cells communicate via connexin (Cx) 43 and Cx26. Gap junction coupling and Cx26 are down-regulated as the ependyma becomes quiescent in adulthood, but injury overrules this developmental down-regulation suggesting a role for Cx signalling in the reactivation of ependymal cells. Here, we aim to explore the role of Cx26 and Cx43 in the response of ependymal cells to injury. We find that Cx26 is critical for the proliferative response to injury and thereby scar formation. Cx43 plays a key role in the communication between ependymal cells of Ca2+ signals induced by activation of P2X7 receptors that trigger downstream events. Our data show that Cxs are relevant targets to manipulate the ependymal stem cell niche to achieve a better self-repair after spinal cord injury.",

    "title": "Bile Acids Regulate Accumbal Cholinergic Circuitry and Dopamine Release through TGR5 Activation",
    "content": "Background: High calorie foods and alcohol produce strong reinforcing effects. Brain mechanisms for these reinforcers have focused largely on indirect mechanisms on mesolimbic circuits. Bile acid secretion is a major factor during caloric intake, however, the role of biliary acids on mesolimbic circuitry remains unexplored. Brain mesolimbic circuits are modulated in part by altering cholinergic interneuron (CIN) activity and tonic dopamine (DA) transmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Ethanol and fatty foods also both stimulate hepatic and possibly local brain bile acid (BA) synthesis, which raises the possibility that BAs may act as a common upstream regulator of these substances shared mesolimbic effects. Methods: This study investigated whether BAs can directly alter mesolimbic activity. We collected electrophysiological data from acute mouse brain slices to assess BA effects on accumbal CIN firing and excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic activity. Bile effects on DA release and clearance in the NAc were measured through voltammetry. Results: We found that low concentrations of a 1:1 mixture of BAs cholic acid and deoxycholic acid (1-10 M) increased CIN firing rate whereas high BA concentrations (1-10 mM) decreased CIN firing. We further demonstrated that BA-induced excitatory effects on CIN firing are independently mediated by at least two mechanisms: Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) activation and suppression of inhibitory CIN currents. Additionally, our results indicate that BAs modulate inhibitory input in a complex manner, reducing frequency at low concentrations, but increasing at high concentrations, and increasing amplitude at low concentrations current amplitude, and the distribution of postsynaptic current amplitude sizes across concentrations. Finally, our voltammetry data show that while low BA concentrations enhance NAc DA release without affecting uptake, whereas high concentrations of BA robustly inhibit accumbal DA release. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that BAs exert direct modulatory effects on neural activity in the striatum.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello!</p> <p>Last year, I started writing a Python C4 model authoring tool, and it has come to a point where I feel good enough to share it with you guys so you can start playing around with it locally and render the C4 model views with PlantUML.</p> <p>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr\">https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr</a></p> <p>Documentation here: <a href=\"https://buildzr.dev/\">https://buildzr.dev</a></p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>buildzr is a <a href=\"https://structurizr.com/\">Structurizr</a> authoring tool for Python programmers. It allows you to declaratively or procedurally author Structurizr models and diagrams.</p> <p>If you're not familiar with Structurizr, it is both an open standard (see <a href=\"https://github.com/structurizr/json\">Structurizr JSON schema</a>) and a <a href=\"https://docs.structurizr.com/usage\">set of tools</a> for building software architecture diagrams as code. Structurizr derives its architecture modeling paradigm based on the <a href=\"https://c4model.com/\">C4 model</a>, the modeling language for describing software architectures and their relationships.</p> <p>In Structurizr, you define architecture models (System Context, Container, Component, and Code) and their relationships first. And then, you can re-use the models to present multiple perspectives, views, and stories about your architecture.</p> <p>buildzr supercharges this workflow with Pythonic syntax sugar and intuitive APIs that make modeling as code more fun and productive.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Use buildzr if you want to have an intuitive and powerful tool for writing C4 architecture models:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Intuitive Pythonic Syntax</strong>: Use Python's context managers (<code>with</code> statements) to create nested structures that naturally mirror your architecture's hierarchy. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr#quick-example\">example</a>.</li> <li><strong>Programmatic Creation</strong>: Use buildzr's DSL APIs to programmatically create C4 model architecture diagrams. Great for automation!</li> <li><strong>Advanced Styling</strong>: Style elements beyond just tags --- target by direct reference, type, group membership, or custom predicates for fine-grained visual control. Just take a look at <a href=\"https://buildzr.dev/user-guide/styles/\">Styles</a>!</li> <li><strong>Cloud Provider Themes</strong>: Add AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and Oracle Cloud icons to your diagrams with IDE-discoverable constants. No more memorizing tag strings! See <a href=\"https://buildzr.dev/user-guide/themes/\">Themes</a>.</li> <li><strong>Standards Compliant</strong>: Stays true to the <a href=\"https://github.com/structurizr/json\">Structurizr JSON schema</a> standards. buildzr uses <a href=\"https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator\">datamodel-code-generator</a> to automatically generate the low-level representation of the Workspace model.</li> <li><strong>Rich Toolchain</strong>: Uses the familiar Python programming language and its rich toolchains to write software architecture models and diagrams!</li> </ul> <p>Quick example, so you can get the idea (more examples and explanations at <a href=\"https://buildzr.dev\">https://buildzr.dev</a>):</p> <pre><code>from buildzr.dsl import ( Workspace, SoftwareSystem, Person, Container, SystemContextView, ContainerView, desc, Group, StyleElements, ) from buildzr.themes import AWS with Workspace('w') as w: # Define your models (architecture elements and their relationships). with Group(&quot;My Company&quot;) as my_company: u = Person('Web Application User') webapp = SoftwareSystem('Corporate Web App') with webapp: database = Container('database') api = Container('api') api &gt;&gt; (&quot;Reads and writes data from/to&quot;, &quot;http/api&quot;) &gt;&gt; database with Group(&quot;Microsoft&quot;) as microsoft: email_system = SoftwareSystem('Microsoft 365') u &gt;&gt; [ desc(&quot;Reads and writes email using&quot;) &gt;&gt; email_system, desc(&quot;Create work order using&quot;) &gt;&gt; webapp, ] webapp &gt;&gt; &quot;sends notification using&quot; &gt;&gt; email_system # Define the views.

Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up.

    "title": "In sync through laughter? An fNIRS hyperscanning study on neural synchrony and social connection",
    "content": "Laughter is a widespread social behavior that has been associated with increases in social connection. However, the mechanisms behind this link are not yet well understood. We hypothesized that laughter supports positive social outcomes by enhancing neural synchrony during social interactions. Neural synchrony is a process of mutual alignment of brain areas, which has been shown to positively affect social interactions. In a 2 \u00d7 2 design, participant pairs watched either funny or neutral videos (Laughter Manipulation: yes/no), either together or separately (Social Context: yes/no). Afterwards, they engaged in a 10-minute free interaction. Laughter behavior was annotated during both phases. Neural synchrony was measured using fNIRS hyperscanning for both phases and quantified across frontal and temporal regions using Wavelet Transform Coherence. As social outcomes, we measured Liking, Prosociality, and Bonding after the free conversation. We tested our hypotheses with Bayesian models that assessed the effects of Laughter and Social context on social outcomes, with synchrony modeled as a mediator. Parameter estimates for the effects of Laughter and Social Context on interpersonal neural synchrony were close to zero, with Bayes Factors indicating evidence for the null hypothesis. Similarly, the effects of Laughter and Social Context on Liking, Prosociality, and Bonding showed no effects. However, model comparisons provided evidence for annotated Laughter Behavior as a predictor of Liking, Prosociality, and Bonding. Mediation analyses revealed no overall effect, but some findings stood out. We observed a negative association between right IFG and right TPJ synchrony during the manipulation phase and later Liking, and a positive association between right and left IFG synchrony and subsequent Prosociality. Additionally, synchrony during the free interaction phase between the left IFG and right TPJ predicted Liking and synchrony between the left and right TPJ predicted Bonding. In total, our findings show no direct link between Laughter and neural synchrony. However, Laughter Behavior was associated with social outcomes. Additionally, neural synchrony was also linked to social outcomes, with distinct positive and negative associations depending on the brain regions involved. These results highlight the complexity of the relationship between laughter, neural synchrony, and social connection, suggesting the need for further research.",

    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "title": "CTSSP: A temporal\u2013spectral-spatial joint optimization algorithm for motor imagery EEG decoding",
    "content": "Objective. Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interfaces hold significant promise for neurorehabilitation, yet their performance is often compromised by electroencephalography (EEG) non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and severe cross-session variability. Current decoding methods typically suffer from fragmented optimization, treating temporal, spectral, and spatial features in isolation. Approach. We propose common temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns (CTSSP), a unified framework that jointly optimizes filters across all three domains. The algorithm integrates: (1) multi-scale temporal segmentation to capture dynamic neural evolution, (2) channel-adaptive finite impulse response filters to enhance task-relevant rhythms, and (3) low-rank regularization to improve generalization. Main results. Evaluated across five public datasets, CTSSP achieves state-of-the-art performance. It yielded mean accuracies of 76.9% (within-subject), 68.8% (cross-session), and 69.8% (cross-subject). In within-subject and cross-session scenarios, CTSSP significantly outperformed competing baselines by margins of 2.6%\u201314.6% (p < 0.001) and 2.3%\u201313.8% (p < 0.05), respectively. In cross-subject tasks, it achieved the highest average accuracy, proving competitive against deep learning models. Neurophysiological visualization confirms that the learned filters align closely with motor cortex activation mechanisms. Significance. CTSSP effectively overcomes the limitations of decoupled feature extraction by extracting robust, interpretable, and coupled temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns. It offers a powerful, data-efficient solution for decoding MI EEG in noisy, non-stationary environments. The code is available at https://github.com/PLC-TJU/CTSSP.",

    "title": "Automated 3D segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from micro-computed tomography images using anatomy-aware neural networks",
    "content": "Objective. Precise segmentation and quantification of nerve morphology from imaging data are critical for designing effective and selective peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapies. However, prior studies on nerve morphology segmentation suffer from important limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. This study introduces a deep learning approach for robust and automated three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) images. Methods. We developed a multi-class 3D U-Net to segment fascicles and epineurium that incorporates a novel anatomy-aware loss function to ensure that predictions respect nerve topology. We trained and tested the network using subject-level five-fold cross-validation with 100 microCT volumes (11.4 \u03bcm isotropic resolution) from cervical and thoracic vagus nerves stained with phosphotungstic acid from five subjects. We benchmarked the 3D U-Net\u2019s performance against a two-dimensional (2D) U-Net using both standard and anatomy-specific segmentation metrics. Results. Our 3D U-Net generated high-quality segmentations (average Dice similarity coefficient: 0.93). Compared to a 2D U-Net, our 3D U-Net yielded significantly better volumetric overlap, boundary delineation, and fascicle instance detection. The 3D approach reduced anatomical errors (topological and morphological implausibility) by 2.5-fold, provided more consistent inter-slice boundaries, and improved detection of fascicle splits/merges by nearly 6-fold. Significance. Our automated 3D segmentation pipeline provides anatomically accurate 3D maps of peripheral neural morphology from microCT data. The automation allows for high throughput, and the substantial improvement in segmentation quality and anatomical fidelity enhances the reliability of morphological analysis, vagal pathway mapping, and the implementation of realistic computational models. These advancements provide a foundation for understanding the functional organization of the vagus and other peripheral nerves and optimizing PNS therapies.",

    "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports.

    "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

    "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "content": "Animals must integrate sensory information, ignore behaviorally irrelevant stimuli, and respond to behaviorally relevant stimuli to find food, find mates, avoid predators, and ultimately survive. In mammals, these goal-directed behaviors require the coordinated activity of many brain regions, including sensory and prefrontal cortices as well as neuromodulatory brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus (LC), which is the brain's primary source of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine resulting from LC activity and arousal indexed by pupil size exert strong influences on goal-directed behavior. We explored the relationships between pupil size, cortical noradrenergic dynamics, and behavior in a tactile signal detection task. We monitored pupil dynamics and fluorescent GRAB_NE signals in somatosensory and prefrontal cortices simultaneously during task execution and found that pupil size and synchronization of GRAB_NE signals at baseline were strong predictors of whether animals chose to respond but not baseline cortical GRABNE levels. We also employed a generalized linear model - hidden Markov model (GLM-HMM) framework to identify distinct, stable behavioral states throughout the task that optimally account for task performance. We found distinct psychometric curves, task-evoked pupil dynamics, and cortical NE dynamics across these behavioral states.",

    "title": "Levels of shared autonomy in brain-robot interfaces: enabling multi-robot multi-human collaboration for activities of daily living",
    "content": "Individuals with ALS and other severe motor impairments often rely on caregivers for daily tasks, which limits their independence and sense of control. Brain-robot interfaces (BRIs) have the potential to restore autonomy, but many existing systems are task-specific and highly automated, which reduces the users' sense of empowerment and limits opportunities to exercise autonomy. In particular, shared autonomy approaches hold promise for overcoming current BRI limitations, by balancing user control with increased robot capabilities. In this work, we introduce a collaborative BRI that integrates non-invasive EEG, EMG, and eye tracking to enable multi-user, multi-robot interaction in a shared kitchen environment with mobile manipulators. Our system modulates assistance through three levels of autonomy\u2014Assisted Teleoperation, Shared Autonomy, and Full Automation\u2014allowing users to retain meaningful control over task execution while reducing effort for routine operations. We conducted a controlled user study comparing autonomy conditions, evaluating performance, workload, ease of use, and agency. Our results show that, while Full Automation was generally preferred by users due to lower workload and higher usability, Shared Autonomy provided higher reliability and preserved user agency, especially in the presence of noisy EEG decoding. Although there was significant individual variability in EEG decoding performance, our post-hoc analysis revealed the potential benefits of customizing pipelines for each user. Finally, we note that our findings are specific to the multi-modal configuration tested and should not be interpreted as a universal claim about the superiority of any autonomy level, and, furthermore, our user study was limited by the use of healthy adults rather than target population (e.g., individuals with ALS), gender imbalance, and a relatively small sample size, which may affect generalizability.

    "content": "IntroductionThis study sought to identify early risk factors and develop a predictive model for progression from self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) accompanied by spike-and-wave activation in sleep (SWAS) to epileptic encephalopathy with SWAS (EE-SWAS), aiming to facilitate early clinical intervention.MethodsFrom a pediatric cohort with spike-and-wave index >50%, we analyzed 77 SeLECTS patients (33 progressed to EE-SWAS, 36 remained stable over \u22652 years of follow-up). Baseline clinical and EEG features were comprehensively evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of cognitive regression, which were incorporated into a nomogram-based predictive model. Model performance was assessed using the C-index in both derivation and external validation cohorts.ResultsProlonged spike-and-wave clusters, high-amplitude spikes with secondary generalization, and younger age at first seizure emerged as independent predictors of EE-SWAS progression. The nomogram model demonstrated high discriminative ability, with a C-index of 0.932 in the derivation cohort and 0.934 in external validation.ConclusionThis study provides the first validated tool for early risk stratification in SWAS-associated SeLECTS, enabling clinicians to anticipate EE-SWAS progression and optimize therapeutic strategies. The model\u2019s robustness supports its potential utility in clinical decision-making to mitigate cognitive decline.",

    "title": "Modulating speech tracking through brain state-dependent changes in audio loudness",
    "content": "Objective. To determine whether the perceptual intensity of speech signals\u2014manipulated via loudness and dynamically adjusted through a brain state-dependent stimulation (BSDS) paradigm\u2014modulates neural speech tracking and short-term memory. Approach. We implemented an EEG brain state-dependent design in which real-time variations in alpha power were used to modulate the loudness of pre-recorded digits during a task modelled on the digit span test. Speech tracking was quantified using lagged Gaussian copula mutual information (2\u201310 Hz), and behavioural performance was assessed through recall accuracy. Main results. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher loudness would enhance speech tracking and memory via bottom\u2013up attention, digit recall accuracy was stable across loudness conditions. Speech tracking revealed an unexpected pattern: louder stimuli presented during high alpha power (low attention) elicited reduced tracking magnitudes and shorter peak latencies, whereas quieter stimuli delivered during low alpha power (high attention) produced stronger and more temporally extended tracking responses. Significance. These findings may suggest that internal attentional state, rather than external stimulus salience, plays a dominant role in shaping speech encoding.

    "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
    "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "title": "Pathophysiologic similarities between autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease: therapeutic possibilities",
    "content": "The comparison of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through shared pathophysiologic features offers intriguing insights into the similarities between the two disease states. The authors suggest diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage through the lymphatic system, perivascular system, and nasal turbinates may occur in ASD and AD, and be an important contributing factor in the occurrence of both disorders. Obstruction of the CSF's normal nasal lymphatic drainage results in abnormal processing of the waste proteins tau and amyloid in the brain in both of these disease states. Reproducible research has shown that ASD and AD patients, when compared to normal controls, exhibit increased extra-axial CSF, enlarged perivascular spaces, magnetic resonance imaging evidence of glymphatic dysfunction, and olfactory dysfunction. Some comparisons between the two disease states are robust while others remain speculative. However, the recognition of overlapping pathophysiologic and genetic features between the two disease states not only furthers understanding of these complex conditions, but could also pave the way for novel therapeutic avenues. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the empirically known similarities between ASD and AD and to stimulate research investigating CSF lymphatic drainage through the nasal turbinates. The authors suggest various ways to confirm their findings and provide suggestions for new therapeutic approaches for these disease states aimed at increasing the movement of CSF originating in the brain through the glymphatic system to meningeal and nasal turbinate lymphatics.",

    "title": "Neural representation of action grammar structure in primate frontal cortex",
    "content": "Humans and other animals can solve new problems, even on the first attempt. This capacity to generate novel problem-solving behavior has been hypothesized to depend on brain mechanisms for recombining units of knowledge using systems of procedural rules, or grammars. Yet, whether and how the brain represents and implements grammars remains unclear, in large part due to the lack of neural recordings (typically performed in animal models) during grammar-based problem solving (typically studied in humans). Here, we address that gap, and in turn identify an underlying neural basis of grammatical behavior. We designed a visual-motor construction task in which macaque monkeys trace complex, often novel, geometric figures by generating a sequence of strokes, each a distinct shape, like a circle, dash, or chevron (action symbols [1]). Critically, sequencing was guided by a learned hierarchical action grammar AnBmCk, meaning \"repeat shape A, then repeat shape B, then repeat shape C\", where the number of repetitions (n, m, and k) varied across problems. Behavior was internally generated (no cues guiding stroke order), problem-directed (to construct a specific image), and exhibited zero-shot generalization (successful on the first trial for novel problems, including harder ones)--key hallmarks of grammar use. To identify underlying neural substrates, we recorded from multiple frontal cortical areas previously implicated in rule use or action sequencing. Activity during drawing encoded key structural properties of the action grammar: (i) shape index (A, B, C), (ii) abstract role (e.g., the role A independent of the specific shape), and (iii) ordinal position within a shape repeat. Moreover, all three properties were strongest in a single region, the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA). We suggest that this conjunction of representations is a signature of an implementation of an iterative algorithm resembling a \"for-loop\" program: internally tracking how many repetitions remain for each shape index and switching to the next when complete. Our study establishes a paradigm for studying the neural basis of grammar-guided novel behavior and identifies in preSMA a dynamic representation of grammatical structure supporting such behavior.",

    "title": "The Periaqueductal Gray Selectively Supports Reversal Learning During a Flexible Discrimination Task in Mice",
    "content": "Flexible, goal-directed behavior depends on the ability to update value representations in response to changing contingencies. This ability depends on distributed brain networks, calling for use of whole-brain imaging. Widely used in human research, whole-brain imaging in rodents has been a major challenge that has only recently been properly addressed. Using functional MRI in behaving mice performing a go/no-go odor discrimination task, we compared neural activity during initial cue-reward learning (acquisition) and subsequent contingency reversal. To link neural activity to underlying learning processes, we modeled value updating using a model-free reinforcement-learning algorithm. Trial-by-trial estimates of state-action values allowed us to dissociate acquisition from reversal-related signals, revealing that ventral striatal responses tracked expected value during acquisition, whereas reversal learning additionally recruited the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a midbrain structure classically linked to threat processing and aversive learning. PAG activity closely followed model-derived signatures of reversal learning, implicating it in the suppression of previously rewarded actions and in updating behavior in the absence of explicit punishment. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized computational role for the PAG in value-based decision-making and cognitive flexibility, and substantiate task-fMRI as a powerful tool to study the rodent brain at a mesoscale resolution.",

    "content": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly shift between tasks and modify our behaviour according to current goals and context. Working memory (WM) is thought to be critical for this cognitive flexibility. A key unanswered question is how neural representations of WM are configured to support different task goals. Thirty-four participants performed a shape WM task with different task rules in interleaved blocks: delayed match-to-sample (DMS) and delayed match-to-category (DMC), while electroencephalography (EEG) was collected. Our results show that stimuli from a circular shape space can be decoded from EEG across the memory delay. Neural stimulus patterns initially generalised across tasks but reconfigured to integrate task and category information and became task-dependent in the later delay. In the DMC task, neural patterns for shapes within a category became more similar than across categories, controlling for their physical distance. This category-dependent shift was associated with greater task-dependency in the neural stimulus representation. Together, our results reveal a dynamic reconfiguration of neural WM representations over the course of the delay period to support distinct task demands.",

    "title": "Oxytocin-dependent reorganization of social vs. food motivational hierarchy and corticostriatal neural activity by social isolation in rats",
    "content": "Social interactions are crucial for the survival and well-being of mammalian individuals. The social homeostasis theory proposes that mammals actively regulate social interactions to maintain an optimal set-point, similar to feeding behavior. Yet, how the social homeostatic drive interacts with competing fundamental needs remains unclear. Moreover, the brain mechanisms underlying social homeostasis are still elusive. A potential such mechanism is oxytocin, a hypothalamic neuropeptide regulating both social and feeding behaviors. We used chronic electrophysiological recordings from behaving rats to analyze local field potential (LFP) signals simultaneously recorded from a network of brain areas associated with reward, motivation, and decision making, while the animals chose between food and social investigation. These experiments were conducted across multiple conditions of social and food deprivation to explore the interplay between the competing needs for food consumption and social interaction. We found that group-housed rats shifted preference toward food under 24-hour food deprivation, whereas socially isolated rats maintained social preference despite equivalent metabolic need. Remarkably, isolation-induced social bias persisted even after one week of re-grouping the animals, indicating long-term reorganization of motivational priorities due to social isolation. LFP recordings revealed that isolated rats exhibited elevated theta power and enhanced network coherence, compared to group-housed rats while making a choice between food to social investigation, regardless of their metabolic state. Canonical correlation analysis demonstrated that metabolic state and housing condition are encoded in orthogonal neural dimensions, suggesting that social isolation creates distinct neural signatures rather than disrupting metabolic state encoding. Systemic administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist restored balanced social-food investigation in isolated rats and selectively suppressed theta oscillations in specific corticostriatal regions during social investigation. These findings establish oxytocin-regulated theta oscillations as a neural substrate through which social experience reorganizes motivational hierarchies. Our results thus demonstrate that social needs can override metabolic drives through oxytocin-dependent modulation of corticostriatal network dynamics.",

Understanding whether individuals share a common foundation in brain function underlying neuroticism is therefore an essential goal of neuroscience. We applied Inter-Subject Representational Similarity Analysis on data from 174 Human Connectome Project participants to investigate if their similarity in neuroticism is reflected in their similarity of fMRI-recorded brain activity during movie watching. To test behavioral personality theories that consider trait expression as dependent on situational context, we examined whether brain-trait representational similarity varied between trait-relevant and trait-irrelevant movie scenes (independently rated, N = 86). Higher neuroticism was associated with greater heterogeneity in brain responses, a pattern that was particularly pronounced during trait-relevant scenes. Our study informs dimensional conceptualizations of psychopathology viewing neuroticism as risk factor and extends behavioral personality theories to the neural level. Broadly, it highlights the value of naturalistic imaging and underscores the importance of stimulus selection when investigating brain-behavior associations.",

    "content": "Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) serve as a key network state in which the hippocampus replays spatiotemporal patterns that reflect animals' experiences. However, how the hippocampal circuitry controls the generation, duration, and termination of these events remains unclear. To clarify how behaviorally salient locations are encoded into replay, we constructed a biologically plausible model of area CA3, including three classes of inhibitory neurons -- parvalbumin-positive basket cells, cholecystokinin-positive basket cells (CCKBC), and theta-OFF, ripple-ON cells (TORO). In our model, replay and SWRs emerge from TORO-mediated release of CCKBC inhibition onto pyramidal cells, as hypothesized by experiments. Furthermore, our model suggests that short-term depression at TORO-CCKBC synapses controls replay duration and identifies a mechanism through which replay overrepresents reward-associated locations. Our model predicts that replays terminating at these locations are shorter, which we confirm in experimental data. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic framework for SWRs and replay dynamics in the hippocampus.",

Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "title": "The influence of the maternal microbiome on offspring neurodevelopment: a critical review of associations, controversies, and challenges",
    "content": "The role of the maternal microbiome in offspring neurodevelopment has become a prominent topic in neuroscience, yet its true causal status is under intense scrutiny. This critical review moves beyond conventional deconstructions of popular hypotheses in the field (e.g., \u201cprenatal programming\u201d \u201cwindows of opportunity\u201d) to challenge a more fundamental premise. We systematically argue that the currently observed associations along the \u201cmicrobiota-gut-brain axis\u201d may reflect complex confounding, with macroscopic social factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) being the true underlying drivers. The core thesis of this paper is that the maternal microbiome is, to a great extent, a \u201cbiological imprint\u201d of the mother\u2019s living environment, diet, and stress levels\u2014a highly sensitive \u201cproxy\u201d indicator acting as a biological mediator heavily shaped by the environment, rather than solely as an independent driver. By integrating evidence from social epidemiology, we contend that positioning the microbiome alongside factors like SES in a \u201cflattened\u201d network model is misleading. Instead, we propose a Hierarchical Causal Model where socioeconomic factors act as top-level \u201cmaster regulators,\u201d systematically shaping all downstream biological processes, including the microbiome. Through a critical analysis of interventions such as Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) and vaginal seeding, this review further exposes the translational predicaments that arise from neglecting this hierarchical structure. Ultimately, this review advocates for a paradigm shift: from searching for a single \u201cmicrobial panacea\u201d to understanding the microbiome\u2019s true position within the socio-biological system, and proposes a conceptual framework for future research that is more aligned with real-world complexity and endowed with greater sociological imagination.",

    "title": "Environmental enrichment as a mitochondria-targeting systems strategy across neurodegenerative diseases and retinal dystrophies",
    "content": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central contributor to neurodegenerative disorders affecting both the central nervous system and the retina, where impaired energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and defective cellular resilience converge to drive progressive neuronal loss. Environmental enrichment (EE), a multimodal non-pharmacological paradigm, has emerged as a powerful modulator of brain and retinal plasticity in preclinical models, promoting adaptive responses that support mitochondrial function and neurotrophic signaling. This review synthesizes evidence indicating that EE influences mitochondrial quality control, redox homeostasis, synaptic resilience, and neuroimmune balance across a range of experimental models of neurodegeneration and retinal dystrophy. While these effects converge on shared downstream pathways, important disease-, cell-type-, and context-specific differences exist, and mechanistic generalization across systems requires caution. Human studies remain limited, heterogeneous, and often focused on functional outcomes rather than direct biological endpoints, resulting in modest and variable effect sizes. Rather than proposing EE as a stand-alone therapy, we frame it as a system-level, disease-modifying context that may enhance endogenous protective capacity and potentially complement pharmacological, genetic, or rehabilitative interventions, pending disease-specific validation. Forward-looking perspectives, including digitally mediated and AI-supported EE-inspired approaches, are discussed as conceptual strategies whose biological relevance will depend on future studies integrating functional outcomes with validated molecular and metabolic biomarkers. Together, the available evidence positions EE as a biologically grounded, non-invasive framework for promoting neuro- and retino-protective resilience, while underscoring the need for rigorously designed translational and clinical studies to define its therapeutic boundaries and mechanisms of action.",

    "content": "Objective. Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million individuals worldwide. Vagus nerve activity is known to be modulated by seizures; however, the types of fibers that are activated during seizures remain unknown. This work compares the electrical activity of the vagus nerve before, during, and after seizures in epileptic rats. Approach. Six rats experiencing pentylenetetrazol-induced epilepsy seizures and two rats under saline solution were investigated. Action potentials (AP) identified by template matching were sorted according to the fiber type they are deemed to originate from. AP templates were based on a 3D COMSOL simplified model of the vagus nerve. Model templates were established for fibers of different diameters based on histology. Correspondences are thus established based on specific fiber diameters. Main results. During seizures, an increase in the percentage of occurrence of APs was observed for 2 \u03bcm and 3 \u03bcm fibers, while a decrease was observed for 4 \u00b5m, 5\u20136 \u00b5m, and 7\u201311 \u00b5m fibers. This was not observed in the rat group under saline solution. The increase in smaller diameter sizes is believed to be linked to an increase in autonomic activity. Significance. These findings contribute to a better understanding of vagus nerve dynamics during epileptic seizures and highlight the potential of vagus nerve activity as a physiological marker for seizure detection and monitoring. This would be of particular interest in vagus nerve stimulation to control any closed-loop form of therapy. This work provides a foundation for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in epilepsy management.",

    "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "content": "Klein et al. (2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I just created a new library called <a href=\"https://github.com/lessico/opticol/\">opticol</a> (which stands for optimized collections), which I wanted to share with the community. The idea of the library is to create space optimized versions of Sequence, Set, and Mapping for small collections leveraging the collections.ABC vocabulary.</p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>Creates optimized versions of the main python collection types (Sequence, Set, Mapping) along with vocabulary types and convenience methods for transforming builtins to the optimized type.</p> <p>For collections of size 3 or less, it is pretty trivial (using slots) to create an object that can act as a collection, but uses notably less memory than the builtins. Consider the fact that an empty set requires 216 bytes, or a dictionary with one element requires 224 bytes. Applications that create many (on the order of 100k to a million) of these objects can substantially reduce their memory usage with this library.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>This will benefit users who use Python for various forms of data analysis. These problems often have many collection instances, which can often be just a few items. I myself have run into issues with memory pressure like this with some NLP datasets. Additionally, this is helpful for those doing this primarily in Python or for situations where dropping to a lower level language is not advantageous yet.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>I could not find a similar library to this, nor even discussion of implementing such an idea. I would be happy to update this section if something comes up, but as far as I know, there are no direct comparisons.</p> <p>Anyway, it's currently a beta release as I'm working on finishing up the last unit tests, but the main use case generally works. I'm also very interested in any feedback on the project itself or other optimizations that may be good to add!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/matgrioni\"> /u/matgrioni </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qhl2o2/opticol_memory_optimized_python_collections/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qhl2o2/opticol_memory_optimized_python_collections/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s been a while since this sub popped up on my feed. It\u2019s coming up more recently. I\u2019m noticing a shocking amount of toxicity on people\u2019s project shares that I didn\u2019t notice in the past. Any attempt to call out this toxicity is met with a wave of downvotes.</p> <p>For those of you who have been in the Reddit echo chamber a little too long, let me remind you that it is not normal to mock/tease/tear down the work that someone did on their own free time for others to see or benefit from. It *is* normal to offer advice, open issues, offer reference work to learn from and ask questions to guide the author in the right direction.</p> <p>This is an anonymous platform. The person sharing their work could be a 16 year old who has never seen a production system and is excited about programming, or a 30 yoe developer who got bored and just wanted to prove a concept, also in their free time. It does not make you a better to default to tearing someone down or mocking their work.</p> <p>You poison the community as a whole when you do so. I am not seeing behavior like this as commonly on other language subs, otherwise I would not make this post. The people willing to build in public and share their sometimes unpolished work is what made tech and the Python ecosystem what it is today, in case any of you have forgotten.</p> <p><strong>\u2014update\u2014</strong></p> <p>The majority of you are saying it\u2019s because of LLM generated projects. This makes sense (to a limit); but, this toxicity is bleeding into some posts for projects that are clearly are not vibe-coded (existed before the LLM boom). I will not call anyone by name, but I occasionally see moderators taking part or enabling the behavior as well.</p> <p>As someone commented, having an explanation for the behavior does not excuse the behavior. Hopefully this at least serves as a reminder of that for some of you. The LLM spam is a problem that needs to be solved. I disagree that this is the way to do it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/behusbwj\"> /u/behusbwj </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qhdssm/when_did_destructive_criticism_become_normalized/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qhdssm/when_did_destructive_criticism_become_normalized/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It's just a website where you can see how many people write the exact same text as you (thought it was a fun idea).<p>It's built using Scotty, SQLite, Redis and Caddy. Currently it's running in a small DigitalOcean droplet (1 Gb RAM).<p>Using Haskell for web development (specifically with Scotty) was slightly easier than I thought, but still a relatively hard task compared to other languages. One of my main friction points was Haskell's multiple string-like types: String, Text (& lazy), ByteString (& lazy), and each library choosing to consume a different one amongst these. There is also a soft requirement to learn monad transformers (e.g. to understand what liftIO is doing) which made the initial development more difficult.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46682732\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46682732</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

    "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
    "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong><br /> Sinew is a Python application that provides an offline Pok\u00e9mon GBA experience. It embeds an emulator using the mGBA libretro core, allowing you to play your gen3 pokemon games within the app while accessing a suite of management tools. You can track your Pokemon across multiple save files, transfer Pokemon (including trade evolutions) between games, view detailed trainer and Pokemon stats, and interact with a fully featured Pokedex that shows both individual game data and combined \u201cSinew\u201d data. Additional features include achievements, event systems, a mass storage system with 20 boxes \u00d7 120 slots, theme customization, and exporting save data to readable JSON format.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong><br /> Sinew is intended for hobbyists, retro Pokemon fans, and Python developers interested in game save management, UI design with Pygame, and emulator integration. It\u2019s designed as an offline, fully user-owned experience.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong><br /> Unlike other Pok\u00e9mon save managers, Sinew combines live gameplay with offline management, cross-game Pokedex tracking, and a complete achievement and rewards system. It\u2019s modular, written entirely in Python, and fully open-source, with an emphasis on safety, user-owned data, and customizability.</p> <p><strong>Source Code / Project Link</strong><br /> GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Cambotz/PKsinew\">https://github.com/Cambotz/PKsinew</a></p> <p>Devlog: <a href=\"https://pksinew.hashnode.dev/pksinew-devlog-index-start-here\">https://pksinew.hashnode.dev/pksinew-devlog-index-start-here</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cambotz\"> /u/Cambotz </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qgydi3/pksinew_pythonpowered_pokemon_save_manager_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qgydi3/pksinew_pythonpowered_pokemon_save_manager_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "I built a Python UI framework inspired by Streamlit, but with O(1) state updates",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>,</p> <p>I love Streamlit's simplicity, but the &quot;full script rerun&quot; on every interaction drove me crazy. It gets super slow once your app grows, and using <code>st.cache</code> everywhere felt like a band-aid.</p> <p>So I spent the last few weeks building <strong>Violit</strong>. I wanted something that feels like writing a simple Python script but performs like a modern React app.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Violit is a high-performance Python web framework. It allows you to build interactive web apps using pure Python without the performance penalty of full-page reloads.</p> <p>It uses a <strong>&quot;Zero Rerun&quot;</strong> architecture based on FastAPI, htmx, and WebSockets. When you interact with a widget (like a button or slider), Violit updates <em>only</em> that specific component in <strong>O(1)</strong> time, ensuring no screen flickering and instant feedback. It also supports running your web app into a desktop app (like electron) with a single flag (<code>--native</code>).</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Data Scientists &amp; Python Devs:</strong> Who need to build dashboards or internal tools quickly but are frustrated by Streamlit's lag.</li> <li><strong>Production Use:</strong> It's currently in early Alpha (v0.0.2), so it's best for internal tools, side projects, and early adopters who want to contribute to a faster Python UI ecosystem.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Here is how Violit differs from existing alternatives:</p> <ul> <li><strong>vs. Streamlit:</strong> Violit keeps the intuitive API (90% compatible) but removes the &quot;Full Script Rerun.&quot; State updates are O(1) instead of O(N).</li> <li><strong>vs. Dash:</strong> Violit offers reactive state management without the &quot;callback hell&quot; complexity of Dash.</li> <li><strong>vs. Reflex:</strong> Violit requires <strong>Zero Configuration</strong>. No Node.js dependency, no build steps. Just <code>pip install</code> and run. Plus, it has built-in native desktop support.</li> <li><strong>vs. NiceGUI:</strong> The theme system for the beautiful app. Unlike Streamlit's rigid look or NiceGUI's engineer-first aesthetic, Violit comes with <strong>30+ Themes</strong> out of the box. You can switch from &quot;cyberpunk&quot; to &quot;retro&quot; styles with a single line of code\u2014no CSS mastery required. <strong>Plus, it's fully extensible\u2014you can easily add your own custom themes via CSS.</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>Code Example</strong></p> <pre><code>import violit as vl \u200b app = vl.App() count = app.state(0) # Reactive State \u200b # No rerun! Only the label updates instantly. app.button(&quot;Increment&quot;, on_click=lambda: count.set(count.value + 1)) app.write(&quot;Count:&quot;, count) \u200b app.run() </code></pre> <p><strong>Link to Source Code</strong></p> <p>It is open source (MIT License).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/violit-dev/violit\">https://github.com/violit-dev/violit</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI:</strong> <code>pip install violit</code></li> <li><strong>Example:</strong> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/violit-dev/violit/blob/main/examples/1_demo_showcase/demo_showcase.py\">demo showcase source code</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/violit-dev/violit/tree/main/examples/2_violit_blog\">(Tutorial) Build Your Own Blog in 10 Minutes with Violit!</a></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Puzzleheaded_Clerk68\"> /u/Puzzleheaded_Clerk68 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qh6733/i_built_a_python_ui_framework_inspired_by/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qh6733/i_built_a_python_ui_framework_inspired_by/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Neural mechanisms of cognitive conflict: processing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation",
    "content": "IntroductionThe rapid spread of misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised important questions about how individuals evaluate false information, particularly when it conflicts with strongly held prior attitudes. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of vaccine-related misinformation may clarify why such beliefs persist despite corrective information.MethodsUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined neural responses to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and factual information in vaccine-receptive participants (N\u202f=\u202f29). During scanning, participants were presented with a series of vaccine-related statements\u2014both accurate and false\u2014and indicated their level of agreement. Analyses focused on the influence of prior beliefs and attitude congruence on neural activation.ResultsContrary to our hypotheses, exposure to attitude-incongruent misinformation did not elicit significant activation in emotional processing regions such as the amygdala or precuneus. However, when participants made attitude-incongruent responses\u2014endorsing misinformation or rejecting accurate information\u2014we observed increased activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), regions associated with decision-making, moral reasoning, memory integration, and cognitive control.DiscussionThese findings suggest that conflicts between incoming information and prior attitudes engage effortful, higher-order cognitive systems rather than affective processing. Resolving such conflicts appears to rely on decision-making and control mechanisms that manage uncertainty and cognitive dissonance. Due to recruitment limitations, the present study focused exclusively on vaccine-receptive individuals. Future research should investigate whether vaccine-resistant individuals exhibit similar or distinct neural patterns, which may provide further insight into the persistence of misinformation in the context of negative prior attitudes.",

    "title": "Novel NPRL3 variant associated with sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy: a case report and educational review",
    "content": "IntroductionSleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a rare epileptic syndrome characterized by nocturnal seizures that predominantly arise during sleep, featuring complex motor behaviors. Pathogenic variants in the nitrogen permease regulator-like 3 (NPRL3) gene and other regulators of the mTOR pathway have been linked to diverse epilepsy phenotypes, including SHE. SHE is challenging to diagnose due to its diverse presentations, overlap with non-epileptic sleep disorders, and semiological similarities to functional/dissociative seizures (FDS).Case reportWe present the case of a 61-year-old woman with a lifelong history of nocturnal paroxysmal events and focal epilepsy. She experienced stereotyped nocturnal episodes of focal motor seizures with retained consciousness, characterized by hyperkinetic activity and asymmetric posturing. Despite multiple antiseizure medications (ASMs), only carbamazepine (CBZ) provided long-term seizure freedom. Genetic testing revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the NPRL3 gene.DiscussionThis case highlights the diagnostic challenges of SHE and the importance of genetic testing in drug-resistant epilepsy. The identified NPRL3 mutation shows the genetic complexity of SHE and its implications for treatment.",

    "title": "Decoding the ''bouba-kiki'' effect in early visual cortex",
    "content": "The ''bouba-kiki'' effect, or sound symbolism, is the non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and visual shapes, in which words like ''bouba'' are consistently associated with round shapes, and ''kiki'' with spiky shapes. Despite robust behavioral evidence for sound symbolic associations, it is still unclear whether they are a linguistic epiphenomenon or manifest themselves as distinct sensory representations in the human brain. Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analyses, we show that, in the absence of visual input, round and spiky sound symbolic words elicit distinct neural representations, not only in auditory and speech processing regions, but also in parietal and even early visual cortex including V1. These neural representations correlate with behavioural shape judgements of sound-symbolic words, as revealed by representational similarity analyses. Our findings suggest a potential functional mechanism for sound symbolism: phonological features of sound symbolic words are represented in auditory and speech processing regions and linked to cross-modal shape representations in parietal and early visual regions, which in turn lead to sound symbolic perceptual judgements. Thus, our results provide evidence for a neural mechanism underlying the ''bouba-kiki'' effect in the human brain.",

    "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

    "title": "Investigating singing imagery as an additional or alternative control task for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces",
    "content": "IntroductionBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a movement-free means of communication and control, typically based on motor imagery (MI) tasks of hand, foot, or tongue movements. Most BCI studies focus on classifying up to four such tasks, which limits the number of available commands and restricts overall system functionality. Expanding the range of reliable mental tasks would directly increase the number of possible commands and thereby enhance the practical utility of BCIs. Singing imagery (SI) may offer an intuitive alternative or additional task to complement conventional MI paradigms.MethodsEEG data were recorded from 14 participants performing right-hand, left-hand, foot, and tongue MI, SI, and rest. Features were extracted using filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP), and tasks were classified with a random forest algorithm across 2-, 4-, 5-, and 6-class scenarios. Subjective data regarding participants' perceived task difficulty and general task preferences was also collected.ResultsClassification accuracies with SI included were comparable to subsets of conventional MI tasks in 2-, 4-, and 5-class scenarios. In the 6-class scenario, average accuracy was approximately 60%, with six participants exceeding 70%, the level often cited as being necessary for effective BCI control. It is reasonable to expect performance to improve further with more advanced analysis methods and participant training.ConclusionThese promising results suggest that singing imagery can serve as both an additional and an alternative task in MI-BCIs. In lower-class systems, SI may provide a valuable option for generating commands, particularly for users who may find some conventional MI tasks less intuitive. When combined with the established MI tasks, SI could increase the number of possible commands, thereby extending the functional capacity of BCI systems. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of SI to broaden the repertoire of mental tasks available for BCI control and to advance the development of more flexible, powerful, and user-centered BCI applications.",

    "title": "Investigating the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus in language evolution: insights from comparative neuroscience",
    "content": "The evolutionary adaptation of the left inferior frontal gyrus is considered a crucial neural specialization supporting the emergence of human language. As a central node in the language network, it is linked to the temporoparietal cortex via both the ventral and dorsal pathways. These connections enable humans to combine a limited set of vocal elements into infinitely diverse, hierarchically structured sequences. Although homologous brain structures are also present in non-human primates, language remains a uniquely human faculty. This review synthesizes anatomical, functional, and connectivity evidence across species to trace the evolution of the left inferior frontal gyrus in support of language. We argue that language did not emerge from novel cortical areas, but through the gradual repurposing, expansion, and optimization of pre-existing fronto-temporal circuits. Human-specific innovations include vocal neuron specialization, volumetric expansion, strengthened connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus, and a functional shift within the left inferior frontal gyrus from motor control to syntactic processing. Finally, we discuss how lesion studies contribute to our understanding of the brain\u2019s potential for language acquisition and its neurobiological constraints.",

    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "title": "Dynamic mode decomposition of resting-state fMRI revealing abnormal brain region features in schizophrenia",
    "content": "Extracting features from abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia patients\u2019 brain images holds significant importance for aiding diagnosis. However, existing methods remained limited in simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal information. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from dynamic systems, making it suitable for time-series signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). This study utilized resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy subjects and 68 schizophrenia patients. The DMD method was employed to extract the mean amplitude of dynamic patterns as features, with feature selection conducted via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. A support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to validate the predictive capability of the selected features across subject groups. Based on the LASSO screening, we identified brain regions exhibiting significant inter-group differences in mean amplitude, designated these as abnormal regions, and subsequently analyzed their functional deviations. The DMD method not only provided explicit temporal dynamic representations of brain activity but also supported signal reconstruction and prediction, thereby enhancing feature interpretability. Results demonstrated that DMD effectively extracted mean amplitude features from fMRI data. Combined with LASSO and SVM, it enabled the identification of abnormal brain regions and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, this method captured frequency-dependent signal patterns, with extracted features correlating with both regional activation intensity and functional connectivity. This approach provides novel insights for exploring potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "Autonomic small fiber involvement in painful long COVID: a histological and clinical study",
    "content": "BackgroundDespite growing recognition of painful long COVID syndrome as a chronic neurological condition marked by pain and autonomic symptoms, the precise contribution of autonomic small fiber involvement is still not well characterized and understood. In this retrospective study, we aimed to identify autonomic small fiber involvement in patients with painful long COVID syndrome by analyzing skin biopsy data. We used nerve fiber density in the piloerector muscles (PMNFD) and sweat glands (SGNFD) as the primary histological outcomes of autonomic innervation.MethodsWe reviewed skin biopsy samples from 50 patients with painful long COVID syndrome and included 31 patients with available PMNFD and SGNFD data for analysis. PMNFD and SGNFD were compared with an age- and sex-matched healthy control group (n = 42). To evaluate whether autonomic involvement was independent of somatic nerve fiber reduction, a subgroup analysis was performed in patients with normal intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) (n = 23). Correlations between histological findings and autonomic symptoms, assessed with the COMPASS-31 questionnaire, were also analyzed.ResultsPiloerector muscle nerve fiber density and SGNFD were significantly reduced in patients with long COVID compared with controls, both in the full sample (p = 0.0135; p < 0.0001) and in the subgroup with normal IENFD (p = 0.0003; p = 0.0005). Neither PMNFD nor SGNFD correlated with COMPASS-31 scores (p = 0.27; p = 0.46) and no association with disease onset, duration and COVID-19 severity was found.ConclusionThese findings provide histological evidence that autonomic small fiber damage is a prominent and measurable feature of painful long COVID syndrome. Importantly, this pathology was also observed in patients with preserved IENFD, indicating that autonomic involvement may occur independently of somatic small fiber loss.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

Human cooperation, where a copilot assists the main player, has been proposed as a solution, but relying on a human assistant poses limitations in terms of availability and co-location. An alternative solution is to use partial automation, where the player is assisted by a software agent. In this work, we present a study with 13 participants with upper-limb impairments, comparatively evaluating how participants collaborate with their copilot in human cooperation and partial automation. The experiment is supported by GamePals, a modular framework that enables both human cooperation and partial automation on existing third-party video games.",

    "title": "Noisy Graph Patterns via Ordered Matrices",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.11171v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The high-level structure of a graph is a crucial ingredient for the analysis and visualization of relational data. However, discovering the salient graph patterns that form this structure is notoriously difficult for two reasons. (1) Finding important patterns, such as cliques and bicliques, is computationally hard. (2) Real-world graphs contain noise, and therefore do not always exhibit patterns in their pure form. Defining meaningful noisy patterns and detecting them efficiently is a currently unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose to use well-ordered matrices as a tool to both define and effectively detect noisy patterns. Specifically, we represent a graph as its adjacency matrix and optimally order it using Moran's $I$. Standard graph patterns (cliques, bicliques, and stars) now translate to rectangular submatrices. Using Moran's $I$, we define a permitted level of noise for such patterns. A combination of exact algorithms and heuristics allows us to efficiently decompose the matrix into noisy patterns. We also introduce a novel motif simplification that visualizes noisy patterns while explicitly encoding the level of noise. We showcase our techniques on several real-world data sets.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.11103v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Advances in AI have enabled ESL learners to practice speaking through conversational systems. However, most tools rely on explicit correction, which can interrupt the conversation and undermine confidence. Grounded in second language acquisition and motivational psychology, we present AI Twin, a system that rephrases learner utterances into more fluent English and delivers them in the learner's voice. Embodying a more confident and proficient version of the learner, AI Twin reinforces motivation through alignment with their aspirational Ideal L2 Self. Also, its use of implicit feedback through rephrasing preserves conversational flow and fosters an emotionally supportive environment. In a within-subject study with 20 adult ESL learners, we compared AI Twin with explicit correction and a non-personalized rephrasing agent. Results show that AI Twin elicited higher emotional engagement, with participants describing the experience as more motivating. These findings highlight the potential of self-representative AI for personalized, psychologically grounded support in ESL learning.",

We then ran a within-subjects lab study (N=32) to examine how disclosure visualizations (Textual, Role-based Timeline, Task-based Timeline, Chatbot) and collaboration ratios (Primarily Human vs. Primarily AI) influenced visualization perceptions, gaze patterns, and post-experience responses. We found that textual disclosures were least effective in communicating human-AI collaboration, whereas Chatbot offered the most in-depth information. Furthermore, while role-based timelines amplified AI contribution in primarily human articles, task-based timeline shifted perceptions toward human involvement in primarily AI articles. We contribute Human-AI collaboration disclosure visualizations and their evaluation, and cautionary considerations on how visualizations can alter perceptions of AI's actual role during news article creation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.11049v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We examine whether large language models (LLMs) can predict biased decision-making in conversational settings, and whether their predictions capture not only human cognitive biases but also how those effects change under cognitive load. In a pre-registered study (N = 1,648), participants completed six classic decision-making tasks via a chatbot with dialogues of varying complexity. Participants exhibited two well-documented cognitive biases: the Framing Effect and the Status Quo Bias. Increased dialogue complexity resulted in participants reporting higher mental demand. This increase in cognitive load selectively, but significantly, increased the effect of the biases, demonstrating the load-bias interaction. We then evaluated whether LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-5, and open-source models) could predict individual decisions given demographic information and prior dialogue. While results were mixed across choice problems, LLM predictions that incorporated dialogue context were significantly more accurate in several key scenarios. Importantly, their predictions reproduced the same bias patterns and load-bias interactions observed in humans. Across all models tested, the GPT-4 family consistently aligned with human behavior, outperforming GPT-5 and open-source models in both predictive accuracy and fidelity to human-like bias patterns. These findings advance our understanding of LLMs as tools for simulating human decision-making and inform the design of conversational agents that adapt to user biases.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.11043v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present Haptic Light-Emitting Diodes (HLEDs), luminous thermopneumatic actuators that directly convert pulsed light into mechanical forces and displacements. Each device packages a miniature surface-mount LED in a gas-filled cavity that contains a low-inertia graphite photoabsorber. The cavity is sealed by an elastic membrane, which functions as a working diaphragm. Brief optical pulses heat the photoabsorber, which heats the gas. The resulting rapid pressure increases generate forces and displacements at the working diaphragm. Millimeter-scale HLEDs produce forces exceeding 0.4 N and displacements of 1 mm at low voltages, with 5 to 100 ms response times, making them attractive as actuators providing tactile feedback in human-machine interfaces. Perceptual testing revealed that the strength of tactile feedback increased linearly with optical power. HLEDs devices are mechanically simple and efficient to fabricate. Unusually, these actuators are also light-emitting, as a fraction of optical energy is transmitted through the membrane. These opto-mechanical actuators have many potential applications in tactile displays, human interface engineering, wearable computing, and other areas.",

Joining the emerging literature on intersectional experiences, we study blind TikTokers (\"BlindTokers\") who are also women and/or LGBTQ+. Using interview data from \\rev{41} participants, we identify their intersectional experiences as mediated by TikTok's socio-technical affordances. We argue that BlindTokers' intersectional marginalization is infrastructural: TikTok's classification and moderation features interact with social norms in ways that push them aside and distort how they are treated on the platform. We use this infrastructure perspective to understand what these experiences are, how they were formed, and how they become harmful. We further recognize participants' infrastructuring work to address these problems. This study guides future social media design with accessible creator tools, inclusive identity options, and context-aware moderation developed in partnership with communities.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.10956v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: One's profession is an essential part of modern life. Traditionally, professional development has been criticized for excluding people with disabilities. People with visual impairments, for example, face disproportionately low employment rates, highlighting persistent gaps in professional opportunities. Recently, there has been growing research on social media platforms as spaces for more equitable career development approaches. In this paper, we present an interview study on the professional development experiences of 60 people with visual impairments on TikTok (also known as \"BlindTokers\"). We report BlindTokers' goals, strategies, and challenges, supported by detailed examples and in-depth analysis. Based on the findings, we identify that BlindTokers' practices reveal an alternative professional development approach that is more flexible, inclusive, personalized, and diversified than traditional models. Our study also extends professional development research by foregrounding emerging digital skills and proposing design implications to foster more equitable and inclusive professional opportunities.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.10824v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social robots hold promise for reducing job interview anxiety, yet designing agents that provide both psychological safety and instructional guidance remains challenging. Through a three-phase iterative design study (N = 8), we empirically mapped this tension. Phase I revealed a \"Safety-Guidance Gap\": while a Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) robot established safety (d = 3.27), users felt insufficiently coached. Phase II identified a \"Scaffolding Paradox\": rigid feedback caused cognitive overload, while delayed feedback lacked specificity. In Phase III, we resolved these tensions by developing an Agency-Driven Interaction Layer. Synthesizing our empirical findings, we propose the Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem, a conceptual framework that redefines robotic coaching not as a static script, but as a dynamic balance between affective support and instructional challenge, mediated by user agency.",

Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.",

    "title": "Overcoming Output Dimension Collapse: When Sparsity Enables Zero-shot Brain-to-Image Reconstruction at Small Data Scales",
    "content": "arXiv:2509.15832v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Advances in brain-to-image reconstruction are enabling us to externalize the subjective visual experiences encoded in the brain as images. A key challenge in this task is data scarcity: a translator that maps brain activity to latent image features is trained on a limited number of brain-image pairs, making the translator a bottleneck for zero-shot reconstruction beyond the training stimuli. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of two translator designs widely used in recent reconstruction pipelines: naive multivariate linear regression and sparse multivariate linear regression. We define the data scale as the ratio of the number of training samples to the latent feature dimensionality and characterize the behavior of each model across data scales. We first show that the naive linear regression model, which uses a shared set of input variables for all outputs, suffers from ``output dimension collapse'' at small data scales, restricting generalization beyond the training data. We then analyze sparse linear regression models in a student--teacher framework and derive expressions for the prediction error in terms of data scale and other sparsity-related parameters. Our analysis clarifies when variable selection can reduce prediction error at small data scales by exploiting the sparsity of the brain-to-feature mapping. Our findings provide quantitative guidelines for diagnosing output dimension collapse and for designing effective translators and feature representations for zero-shot reconstruction.",

    "content": "arXiv:2506.21828v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Study Objectives: Fetal sleep is a vital yet underexplored aspect of prenatal neurodevelopment. Its cyclic organization reflects the maturation of central neural circuits, and disturbances in these patterns may offer some of the earliest detectable signs of neurological compromise. This is the first review to integrate more than seven decades of research into a unified, cross-species synthesis of fetal sleep. We examine: (i) Physiology and Ontogeny-comparing human fetuses with animal models; and (ii) Methodological Evolution-transitioning from invasive neurophysiology to non-invasive monitoring and deep learning frameworks.\n  Methods: A structured narrative synthesis was guided by a systematic literature search across four databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar). From 2,925 identified records, 171 studies involving fetal sleep-related physiology, sleep-state classification, or signal-based monitoring were included in this review.\n  Results: Across the 171 studies, fetal sleep states become clearly observable as the brain matures. In fetal sheep and baboons, organized cycling between active and quiet sleep emerges at approximately 80%-90% gestation. In humans, this differentiation occurs later, around 95% gestation, with full maturation reached near term. Despite extensive animal research, no unified, clinically validated framework exists for defining fetal sleep states, limiting translation into routine obstetric practice.\n  Conclusions: By integrating evidence across species, methodologies, and clinical contexts, this review provides the scientific foundation for developing objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies-tools that may ultimately support earlier detection of neurological compromise and guide timely prenatal intervention.",

    "content": "arXiv:2412.04172v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Neurons depend on two interdependent mechanisms-homeostasis and neuromodulation-to maintain robust and adaptable functionality. Homeostasis stabilizes neuronal activity by adjusting ionic conductances, whereas neuromodulation dynamically modifies ionic properties in response to external signals. Combining these mechanisms in conductance-based models often produces unreliable outcomes, particularly when sharp neuromodulation interferes with homeostatic tuning. This study explores how a biologically inspired neuromodulation controller can harmonize with homeostasis to ensure reliable neuronal function. Using computational models of stomatogastric ganglion and dopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that controlled neuromodulation preserves neuronal firing patterns while maintaining intracellular calcium levels. Unlike sharp neuromodulation, the neuromodulation controller integrates activity-dependent feedback through mechanisms mimicking G-protein-coupled receptor cascades. The interaction between these controllers critically depends on the existence of an intersection in conductance space, representing a balance between target calcium levels and neuromodulated firing patterns. Maximizing neuronal degeneracy enhances the likelihood of such intersections, enabling robust modulation and compensation for channel blockades. We further show that this controller pairing extends to network-level activity, reliably modulating central pattern generators in crustaceans. These findings suggest that targeting neuromodulation pathways-rather than ion channels directly-may offer safer pharmacological strategies to manage neuronal dysfunctions. This study highlights the complementary roles of homeostasis and neuromodulation, proposing a unified control framework for maintaining robust and adaptive neural activity under physiological and pathological conditions.",

We address the problem of decoding visual information from high-density intracortical recordings in primates, using the THINGS Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset. We systematically evaluate the effects of model architecture, training objectives, and data scaling on decoding performance. Results show that decoding accuracy is mainly driven by modeling temporal dynamics in neural signals, rather than architectural complexity. A simple model combining temporal attention with a shallow MLP achieves up to 70% top-1 image retrieval accuracy, outperforming linear baselines as well as recurrent and convolutional approaches. Scaling analyses reveal predictable diminishing returns with increasing input dimensionality and dataset size. Building on these findings, we design a modular generative decoding pipeline that combines low-resolution latent reconstruction with semantically conditioned diffusion, generating plausible images from 200 ms of brain activity. This framework provides principles for brain-computer interfaces and semantic neural decoding.",

    "title": "Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.10912v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
    "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

    "content": "<p>Quick background: I used to code. Studied it in school, wrote some projects, but eventually convinced myself I wasn't cut out for it. Too slow, too many bugs, imposter syndrome \u2014 the usual story. So I pivoted, ended up as an investment associate at an early-stage angel fund, and haven't written real code in years.<p>Fast forward to now. I'm a Buffett nerd \u2014 big believer in compound interest as a mental model for life. I run compound interest calculations constantly. Not because I need to, but because watching numbers grow over 30-40 years keeps me patient when markets get wild. It's basically meditation for long-term investors.<p>The problem? Every compound interest calculator online is terrible. Ugly interfaces, ads covering half the screen, can't customize compounding frequency properly, no year-by-year breakdowns. I've tried so many. They all suck.<p>When vibe coding started blowing up, something clicked. Maybe I could actually build the calculators I wanted? I don't have to be a \"real developer\" anymore \u2014 I just need to describe what I want clearly.<p>So I tried it.<p>Two weeks and ~$100\uff08Opus 4.5 thinking model\uff09 in API costs later: I somehow have 60+ calculators. Started with compound interest, naturally. Then thought \"well, while I'm here...\" and added mortgage, loan amortization, savings goals, retirement projections. Then it spiraled \u2014 BMI calculator, timezone converter, regex tester. Oops.<p>The AI (I'm using Claude via Windsurf) handled the grunt work beautifully. I'd describe exactly what I wanted \u2014 \"compound interest calculator with monthly/quarterly/yearly options, year-by-year breakdown table, recurring contribution support\" \u2014 and it delivered. With validation, nice components, even tests.<p>What I realized: my years away from coding weren't wasted. I still understood architecture, I still knew what good UX looked like, I still had domain expertise (financial math). I just couldn't type it all out efficiently. AI filled that gap perfectly.<p>Vibe coding didn't make me a 10x engineer. But it gave me permission to build again. Ideas I've had for years suddenly feel achievable. That's honestly the bigger win for me.<p>Stack: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, four languages (EN/DE/FR/JA). The AI picked most of this when I said \"modern and clean.\"<p>Site's live at <a href=\"https://calquio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://calquio.com</a> . The compound interest calculator is still my favorite page \u2014 finally exactly what I wanted.<p>Curious if others have similar stories. Anyone else come back to building after stepping away?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46673809\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46673809</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 19</p>",

    "content": "Objective. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort. Approach. Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery. Main results. 26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone. Significance. Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.",

I iterated over it in my free time, and yesterday I felt like I had a pretty good version to share with y'all.<p>It's not meant to be a sequencer but rather a way to experiment with beats and basic sounds, save them, and use them in your songs. It also has a sharing feature with a link.<p>It was built using Tone.js [2], Stimulus [3] and deployed in Render [4] as a static website. I used an LLM to read the Tone.js documentation and generate sounds, since I have no knowledge about sound production, and modified from there.<p>Anyway, hope you like it!

    "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
    "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

    "title": "The impact of dynamic reversal potential on the evolution of action potential attributes during spike trains",
    "content": "Action potentials (AP) are the basic elements of information processing in the nervous system. Understanding AP generation mechanisms is a critical step to understand how neurons encode information. However, an individual neuron might fire APs with various shapes even in response to the same stimulus, and the mechanisms responsible for this variability remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed four AP attributes including AP rapidity and threshold during consecutive bursts from three neuron types using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. In response to consecutive current steps, the AP attributes in evoked spike trains show two distinctive patterns across different neurons: (1) The first APs from each train always have comparable properties regardless of the stimulus strength; (2) The attributes of the subsequent APs during each pulse monotonically change during the burst, where the magnitude of AP attribute change during each pulse increases with increasing stimulation strength. Various conductance-based models were explored to determine if they replicated the observed AP bursts. The observed patterns could not be replicated using the classical HH-type models, or modified HH model with cooperative Na+ gating. However, adding ion concentration dynamics to the model reproduced the AP attribute variation, and the magnitude of change during a pulse correlated with change in dynamic reversal potential (DRP), but failed to replicate the first AP attributes pattern. Then, the role of cooperative Na+ gating on neuronal firing dynamics was investigated. Inclusion of cooperative gating restored the first APs\u2019 attributes and enhanced the magnitude of modeled variation of some AP attributes to better agree with observed data. We conclude that changes in local ion concentrations could be responsible for the monotonic change in APs attributes during neuronal bursts, and cooperative gating of Na+ channels can enhance the effect. Thus, the two mechanisms could contribute to the observed variability in neuronal response.",

    "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
    "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

    "title": "AMANet: a data-augmented multi-scale temporal attention convolutional network for motor imagery classification",
    "content": "Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interface (MI-BCI) has garnered considerable attention due to its potential for neural plasticity. However, the limited number of MI-EEG samples per subject and the susceptibility of features to noise and artifacts posed significant challenges for achieving high decoding performance. To address this problem, a Data-Augmented Multi-Scale Temporal Attention Convolutional Network (AMANet) was proposed. The network mainly consisted of four modules. First, the data augmentation module comprises three steps: sliding-window segmentation to increase sample size, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) extraction of discriminative spatial features, and linear scaling to enhance network robustness. Then, multi-scale temporal convolution was incorporated to dynamically extract temporal and spatial features. Subsequently, the ECA attention mechanism was integrated to realize the adaptive adjustment of the weights of different channels. Finally, depthwise separable convolution was utilized to fully integrate and classify the deep extraction of temporal and spatial features. In 10-fold cross-validation, the results show that AMANet achieves classification accuracies of 84.06 and 85.09% on the BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b, respectively, significantly outperforming baseline models such as Incep-EEGNet. On the High-Gamma dataset, AMANet attains a classification accuracy of 95.48%. These results demonstrate the excellent performance of AMANet in motor imagery decoding tasks.",

    "title": "Methodological optimization for eliciting robust median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials for realtime single trial applications",
    "content": "Objective. Single-trial measurement of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting its use in real-time neurorehabilitation applications. We describe and evaluate methodological optimizations for eliciting reliable median nerve SEPs measurable in real time, with reduced reliance on post-processing. Methods. In twelve healthy participants, two sessions each, SEPs were assessed at three pulse widths (0.1, 0.5, 1 ms), at a low-frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz \u00b1 10%), and at an intensity sufficient to evoke consistent and robust sensory nerve action potentials and compound muscle action potentials. The evoked potential operant conditioning system platform was used to monitor responses in real time. Feasibility was also evaluated in a participant with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Results. SEP P50 and N70 were reliably elicited in healthy participants, and in individual with iSCI, across all tested pulse widths with minimal discomfort. N70 amplitude increased significantly with pulse width ( = 17.64, p = 0.0001, w = 0.80), while P50 amplitude remained unchanged. SNR showed a significant pulse width-dependent increase ( = 7.82, p = 0.02, w = 0.35) with improvements of 40% and 52% at 0.5 and 1 ms, respectively. N70 single-trial separability significantly improved at 1 ms (AUC of 0.83, = 8.17, p= 0.017), including the iSCI participant (0.84\u2013less impaired hand, 0.79\u2013more impaired hand). Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70\u20130.84, p < 0.05) was highest at 0.5 ms, indicating more consistent N70 and P50 measurements across sessions at a longer pulse width. Significance. Robust median nerve SEPs can be measured at single trials with methodological optimizations such as a longer pulse width (0.5\u20131 ms), low frequency (0.5 Hz), a consistent afferent excitation guided by nerve and muscle responses, and a robust EEG acquisition system. This setup can be useful for real time SEP-based brain computer interface applications for rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Objective: This article aimed to examine the psychometric properties of a measure of youth fear-avoidance of concussive symptoms. Method: Fear-avoidance is thought to be a risk factor for prolonged concussion recovery; however, current measures of fear-avoidance focus on pain rather than broader symptoms. We adapted the Fear of Pain Questionnaire to be relevant to concussion symptoms with a new version called the Fear of Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire (FOCSQ). We assessed the psychometrics of this scale with a sample of <em>N</em> = 115 youth with persistent postconcussive symptoms (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 15.1 years, 58% female, 70% non-Hispanic White, 15% Hispanic, <em>M</em> = 79.2 days since injury), including reliability, construct validity, and cross-informant reliability. Results: Exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor model was a good fit for youth report (fear and avoidance) and a three-factor model for parent proxy (fear, school/social avoidance, and movement avoidance). Reliability was excellent, with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for both youth report and parent proxy of 0.93 (95% CI [0.91, 0.95]). Construct validity indicated moderate correlation between youth-report FOCSQ and concussive symptoms 0.55 (95% CI [0.41, 0.66]), headache severity 0.37 (95% CI [0.19, 0.53]), depression 0.62 (95% CI [0.49, 0.72]), and anxiety 0.64 (95% CI [0.51, 0.73]). Criterion-related validity was supported by an inverse correlation between FOCSQ and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory: \u22120.64 (95% CI [\u22120.74, \u22120.52]). Youth report and parent proxy were moderately correlated, with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient <em>r</em> = 0.60 (95% CI [0.47, 0.71]). Conclusions: The FOCSQ is a reliable and valid measure of fear-avoidance in youth with concussion, and future research might explore whether this measure could be used to identify youth at risk for prolonged recovery.

    "title": "Phonological networks remain intact in multiple sclerosis.",
    "content": "Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition characterized by white and gray matter decline that leads to slower motor function and cognitive impairment. Although language remains relatively intact, individuals with MS often have word retrieval difficulties. Previous research suggests that these difficulties may be related to vocabulary, the number of words an individual knows, and other semantic aspects of language. However, few studies have examined phonological aspects of speech. Method: We examined speech in 89 individuals with MS and 88 age-matched neurotypical adults using a phonemic verbal fluency task. We took a network science approach, building a phonological network from participants\u2019 responses and their close phonological neighbors. We then examined the local network characteristics (degree, clustering coefficient) of participants\u2019 responses to assess whether responses differed between the groups. Results: Although individuals with MS produced fewer responses during the task, the network characteristics of their responses were similar to neurotypical adults, the control group. Moreover, lexical characteristics such as word length and lexical frequency were also similar between groups (model <em>R</em>\u00b2 values < 1%). Finally, a forward flow analysis, which quantifies the phonological similarity between adjacent responses and provides a metric of how people search phonemic space, did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that phonological aspects of speech remain stable in individuals with MS. Word retrieval difficulties in MS may arise from neurological changes in semantic processes, in combination with other cognitive abilities such as speed of processing and executive function, which are common in MS.

    "title": "Moral decision making and moral judgment in multiple sclerosis.",
    "content": "Objective: Moral cognition has been insufficiently studied in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). This study investigated moral decision making and judgment using ecologically valid moral dilemmas in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive MS phenotypes, exploring associations with clinical and psychological variables. Method: Twenty-one individuals with relapsing-remitting MS and 21 with progressive MS completed a battery of moral dilemmas (instrumental, incidental, and ecological) and questionnaires assessing quality of life, mood, alexithymia, and empathy. Data from pwMS were compared to those of 56 age- and education-matched healthy controls. Group differences were analyzed using Mann\u2013Whitney U tests, and effect sizes (<em>r</em>) were reported. Results: Compared to healthy controls, pwMS showed significantly higher moral acceptability in instrumental (<em>U</em> = 633.0, <em>p</em> = .001, <em>r</em> = 0.39), incidental (<em>U</em> = 745.5, <em>p</em> = .035, <em>r</em> = 0.23), and ecological dilemmas (<em>U</em> = 563.0, <em>p</em>< .001, \n<em>r</em> = 0.44). Moral permissiveness was positively correlated with disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale: \u03c1 = 0.36, <em>p</em> = .019) and negatively with physical quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life\u2013Physical: \u03c1 = \u22120.33, <em>p</em> = .034) and inhibitory control (Stroop Test: \u03c1 = 0.47, <em>p</em> = .002). Empathy scores were inversely correlated with moral acceptability across all dilemmas (<em>p</em> < .05). Conclusions: PwMS exhibit increased moral permissiveness, particularly in relation to clinical disability, physical functioning, and executive control. These findings contribute to characterizing the sociocognitive profile of MS and support the inclusion of moral cognition in future research, though implications for patient care remain preliminary.

    "title": "Moderating effects of limbic white matter on verbal memory in older adults with multiple sclerosis.",
    "content": "Objective: Literature concerning the structural brain correlates of verbal memory in aging with multiple sclerosis (MS) is scarce. This study addressed this gap by examining the impact of white matter microstructure and macrostructure on verbal memory in older adults with and without MS. Method: Participants were 64 older adults with MS (OAMS; age <em>M</em> [<em>SD</em>] = 64.19 [3.82]) and 72 controls (age <em>M</em> [<em>SD</em>] = 69.78 [6.99]). Verbal memory was measured using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test\u2013Revised (HVLT-R), and white matter fractional anisotropy and lesion volume were extracted from diffusion tensor and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery magnetic resonance imaging. Statistical models examined whether white matter measures moderated the association between the presence of MS and HVLT-R performance. Results: Adjusted moderation models revealed that OAMS showed lower HVLT-R total immediate recall compared to controls in the presence of higher lesion volume in the bilateral fornices, left uncinate fasciculus, and right ventral cingulum, and lower HVLT-R delayed recall in the presence of lower fractional anisotropy in the right ventral cingulum and higher lesion volume in the left uncinate fasciculus and right ventral cingulum, with small effect sizes (interaction term \u0394<em>R</em>\u00b2s = .03\u2013.06,<em> p</em>s < .05). Conclusions: Recall was lower in OAMS when limbic tract white matter had lower integrity and higher lesion load. Findings suggest that the influence of MS on verbal memory in older adults is related, in part, to underlying white matter disruptions in tracts implicated in memory. While the sample was generally representative of the U.S. MS population (majority White women), generalizability is limited and warrants further research.

    "content": "Objective: Previous research suggested that Recognition Memory Test\u2013Words (RMT-W) scores may be confounded by gender and handedness. This study was designed to examine its classification accuracy as a performance validity test (PVT) and susceptibility to demographic characteristics. Method: Archival data were collected from a consecutive sequence of 310 diagnostically heterogeneous examinees (181 men; <em>M</em><sub>Age</sub> = 41.4; <em>M</em><sub>Education</sub> = 12.9). The RMT-W\u2019s classification accuracy was computed against psychometrically operationalized criterion groups. Results: Optimal RMT-W cutoffs (\u2264 42 to \u2264 40) produced a good combination of sensitivity (.62\u2013.70) and specificity (.90\u2013.96), correctly classifying 85.6%\u201387.7% of the sample. Women scored 1.5 points higher. RMT-W scores were unrelated to handedness but were correlated with education. A linear relationship emerged between level of education and the cutoff needed to achieve \u2265 .90 specificity: \u2264 43 for \u2265 13 years of education, \u2264 41 for 12 years of education, and \u2264 39 for \u2264 11 years of education. RMT-W \u2264 45 had .91 specificity in women with postsecondary education. Conclusions: Results suggest that overall, the RMT-W remains an effective free-standing PVT. Gender, age, and handedness in isolation had minimal impact on RMT-W scores. However, education had a clinically significant effect. The combined effect of gender and education produced a marked shift in classification accuracy. Systematic research is needed on the relationship between demographics and PVT outcomes to ensure that cutoffs have the same clinical interpretation regardless of patient variables.

    "content": "To address the mismatch between current ankle rehabilitation robots and natural human motion, which affects rehabilitation efficacy, this paper uses screw theory and motion capture experiments to identify the instantaneous finite helical motion axis (IFHA) of the human ankle joint. It determines the distribution law of the IFHA and twist pitch (TP) of the ankle, and designs a human-machine motion compatible rope-driven ankle joint rehabilitation robot that meets the needs of human ankle joint rehabilitation. Firstly, human ankle motion trajectories are captured using the VICON system and IMU, and the experimental data are processed according to screw theory to obtain the distribution law of the IFHA and the range of TP. Secondly, the ankle joint's motion characteristics from the experiment inform the constraint characteristics of the rehabilitation mechanism, which are then mapped into a novel parallel rope-driven ankle rehabilitation robot to meet rehabilitation needs. Thirdly, the kinematic model of the novel mechanism is established, and its kinematic performance and singular configurations are analyzed based on the motion/force transmission index, guiding the optimization of the driving rope layout and mechanism scale parameters. Finally, an experimental platform is built to validate the human-machine motion compatibility, safety, comfort, and effectiveness of the rehabilitation robot.",

    "title": "GONet: A Generalizable Deep Learning Model for Glaucoma Detection",
    "content": "Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON), affecting an estimated 64.3 million people globally, causes irreversible vision loss when not detected early. Traditional diagnosis requires time-consuming ophthalmic examinations by specialists. Recent deep learning models for automating GON detection from colour fundus photographs (CFP) have shown promise but often suffer from limited generalizability across different ethnicities, disease groups and examination settings. To address these limitations, we introduce GONet, a robust deep learning model developed using seven independent datasets, including over 119\u2009000 CFPs with gold-standard annotations and from patients of diverse geographic backgrounds. GONet consists of a DINOv2 pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer fine-tuned using a multisource domain strategy. GONet demonstrated high out-of-distribution generalizability, with an AUC of 0.88-0.99 in target domains. GONet performance was similar or superior to state-of-the-art works and the cup-to-disc ratio, by up to 18.4%. GONet is available via Lirot.ai (www.aimlab-technion.com/lirot-ai). We also contribute a new dataset consisting of 747 CFPs with GON labels as open access, available at https://doi.org/10.13026/pdxv-m215.",

    "title": "Phase Correction of MR Spectroscopic Imaging Data Using Model-Based Signal Estimation and Extrapolation",
    "content": "Objective: To develop an effective method for phase correction of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. Methods: In many MRSI applications, it is desirable to generate absorption-mode spectra, which requires correction of phase errors in the measured MRSI data. Conventional phase correction methods are sensitive to measurement noise and baseline distortion, often resulting in distorted absorption-mode spectra from MRSI data with low-SNR and long acquisition dead time. This paper proposed a novel model-based method for improved phase correction of MRSI data. The proposed method determined the zeroth-order phase and acquisition dead time using a Lorentzian-based spectral model and performed signal extrapolation using a generalized series model. Absorption-mode spectra were then generated from the phase-corrected and extrapolated MRSI data. Results: The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated data and experimental data acquired from human subjects in multi-nuclei (31P, 2H, and 1H) MRSI experiments. Simulation results demonstrated improved parameter estimation accuracy by the proposed method under various noise levels and dead times. The proposed method also consistently generated high-quality absorption-mode spectra with minimal spectral distortions from experimental data. The proposed method was compared with state-of-the-art methods (including the entropy method and LCModel method) and showed more robust phase correction performance with less spectral distortions. Conclusion: This paper introduced a novel method for phase correction of MRSI data. Results from simulated and in vivo data demonstrated that high-quality absorption-mode spectra could be obtained using the proposed method. Significance: This method will provide a useful tool for processing MRSI data.",

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Exploring the link between National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery performance and everyday functioning in mild cognitive impairment.",
    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychologists routinely use scores on traditional paper-and-pencil tests to assess capacity for independent functioning, with these assessments accounting for a moderate amount (20%\u201337%) of the variance in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) performance. The field is shifting toward incorporation of computerized neuropsychological assessments such as the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB). There have been no studies examining how the NIHTB-CB relates to IADL performance or whether it better predicts IADL performance compared to traditional methods. Method: Data from 74 participants in the Lithium as a Treatment to Prevent Impairment of Cognition in Elders were analyzed. Participants completed a neuropsychological assessment battery, the NIHTB-CB, and measures of IADL capacity. Linear regression was used to determine whether NIHTB-CB performance predicted IADL performance. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to determine whether NIHTB-CB added incremental validity to the prediction of IADL performance. Results: Select NIHTB-CB measures predicted IADL functioning as measured by a performance-based assessment of everyday functioning, but not self- or informant-reported everyday functioning. Of these subtests, two were found to add incremental validity to the prediction of IADL performance above and beyond their matched traditional measures, with effect sizes ranging from mild to moderate (<em>F</em>\u0394<em>R</em>\u00b2 = .045\u2013.077). Conclusions: We found performance on individual NIHTB-CB subtests predicted approximately the same amount of variance in IADL functioning as traditional tests, with only subtests assessing processing speed and executive functioning adding a mild to moderate amount of additional variance above matched measures. It remains important for clinicians to consider additional determinants of functioning when using computerized assessments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Familial longevity, educational attainment, and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities are independently protective for cognitive aging, yet little is known about how these factors relate with one another. We explored the interplay between familial longevity, life exposures that confer cognitive resilience, and cognitive function in the Long Life Family Study. Method: A series of Bayesian hierarchical regression models was used to examine the associations among familial longevity, educational attainment, participation in cognitively stimulating activities, and neuropsychological test performance in several cognitive domains in an ancillary observational study of Long Life Family Study family members and a referent cohort (<em>N</em> = 314, <em>M</em> = 75.7, <em>SD</em> = 14.6 years). Models were adjusted by age, sex, and upstream variables along the regression pathway (i.e., cognitive activity, education, and familial longevity), and incorporated a random intercept for family relatedness. Results: Referents had greater engagement in cognitive activities, and in turn, those with higher levels of education and cognitive activity exhibited better neuropsychological performance. Greater cognitive activity was specifically associated with better executive functioning, episodic memory, and language scores. Although Long Life Family Study family members engaged in cognitive activities less often than referents, they performed better on tests of episodic memory, and matched performance on tests of executive function, language, and visuoconstruction. Conclusions: These results suggest that familial longevity and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities represent two distinct pathways that contribute to preserved cognition in older adulthood, though these findings should be replicated in more diverse samples. Furthermore, these unique pathways differ across tests and cognitive domains. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Remote assessment of episodic memory would be a cost-effective alternative to in-person visits for early detection of memory impairment related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), but there is a need for test development and studies in population-based samples. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity and correlates of a novel three-trial administration of 10-word list learning included in the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status in a population-based study of 65- to 96-year-old individuals. Method: A total of 800 participants completed telephone-administered word list learning task that yielded immediate and delayed recall measures. We compared these to corresponding measures from in-person neuropsychological assessment and tested differences between cognitively normal individuals and those with cognitive impairment or neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, we studied the associations of age, sex, education, and genetic risk of AD with telephone-administered memory measures. Results: Telephone-administered three-trial word list learning task yielded normally distributed immediate and delayed recall measures that performed like corresponding measures from in-person assessment. Having cognitive impairment or AD\u2014but not genetic risk of AD\u2014were related to poorer memory performance. Younger age, being female, and having secondary education were related to better memory performance. Conclusion: Our study supports the validity of telephone-administered word list task with multiple learning trials. Remote assessment of memory can be used as an alternative to inviting people to in-person assessment and is also easily accessible for people living in remote areas and for those with physical disabilities or during restrictions related to in-person contact.

Method: Participants (<em>N</em> = 891) from the University of California Davis Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center longitudinal cohort (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 76.1, <em>SD</em><sub>age</sub> = 7.4) were followed for an average of 4.4 years with annual ECog assessments.

Results: ECog domains changed at different rates when modeled as a function of diagnosis change; differences in domain were most apparent in the stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-MCI and MCI-to-dementia conversion groups. By contrast, ECog domains changed at the same rate when modeled as a function of baseline gray matter volume and longitudinal gray matter volume change, corresponding to other research suggesting that cognitive domains change at relatively uniform rates over time. In separate models, total gray matter and hippocampus atrophy were salient predictors of ECog score changes. At baseline, hippocampus volume was the strongest predictor of ECog intercepts. Conclusions: Although some caution is warranted interpreting score changes due to floor and ceiling effects, the ECog appears sensitive to underlying gray matter atrophy and change in clinical disease severity when used longitudinally.

Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved.

    "title": "A Birdcage Volume Transmit Coil and 8 Channel Receive Array for Marmoset Brain Imaging at 7T",
    "content": "Objective: To design and fabricate a band-pass birdcage volume resonator and eight channel, conformal receive array coil for MRI of both awake and anesthetized marmoset brain at 7T. The coil is compatible with a whole body 7T clinical MRI scanner running in single channel transmit (sTx) mode. Methods: The marmoset head coil included a shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil with 24 legs, as well as 8 overlapped receive elements. Electromagnetic (EM) field simulation was performed for the 24 leg band pass birdcage Tx coil to calculate the B1+ efficiency. The efficacy of both transmit and receive coil designs were evaluated by measuring standard coil performance metrics. This was done while imaging a marmoset head phantom, as well as by acquiring in vivo, anesthetized and awake marmoset images. Results: The transmit coil along with the optimized receive array produced high resolution (0.8 mm isotropic for EPI images; 0.36 mm isotropic for structural images) and high SNR (between 50 and 80) images of the marmoset brain. The simulated B1+ efficiency of the birdcage at the center of the phantom was 2.6 \u00b5T/sqrt (W). Conclusion and significance: A shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil was designed and fabricated for marmoset brain imaging at 7T. An 8-channel receive array consisting of eight overlapped loops, covering the whole brain of the marmoset, was also constructed and applied for signal reception. The system successfully allowed scanning of both young and older marmosets. It is well-suited for longitudinal studies of marmoset brain structure. The coil advantageously allows the study of neurodevelopment and primate brain function.",

    "title": "A Hybrid Distributed Capacitance Birdcage Coil for Small-Animal MR Imaging at 14.1 T",
    "content": "Objective: To develop a transceiver radio frequency (RF) coil optimized for high resolution small-animal imaging at 14.1 T, aimed at enhancing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. Methods: A hybrid distributed capacitance (HDC) birdcage coil was designed, combining conventional endring lumped capacitors with distributed capacitance along the legs, implemented using double-layer copper-clad substrates. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations were employed to optimize the coil's structural parameters and capacitance values for maximum RF performance. The HDC birdcage coil's performance was evaluated against a conventional bandpass (BP) design through electromagnetic simulations, bench tests, and phantom imaging. In vivo validation was performed using mouse imaging. Results: EM simulations demonstrated that the HDC design enhances mean $\\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ and $\\text{B}_{1}^{-}$ field strengths by 11.8% and 11.7%, respectively, relative to the conventional BP design. The HDC design also showed reduced electric field (E-field) value in phantom, with 4.2% lower mean and 11.4% lower maximum E-field value. Bench measurements revealed a superior quality factor (Q factor) for the HDC coil, with a 34.2% higher unloaded Q value compared to the conventional design. Phantom imaging confirmed a 41% SNR improvement with the HDC design. The optimized HDC coil enabled mouse brain imaging at 50 $ \\!\\!\\mu \\!\\!\\text{ m}$ resolution.Conclusion: The proposed HDC birdcage coil demonstrated superior receiver sensitivity and Q factor compared to conventional designs, yielding significant SNR improvements in 14.1 T imaging. Significance: The results demonstrated the feasibility of achieving enhanced coil performance through HDC design at ultra-high field strength, providing a promising approach for improving image quality in small-animal MRI applications.",

    "title": "Show HN: Lume 0.2 \u2013 Build and Run macOS VMs with unattended setup",
    "content": "<p>Hey HN, Lume is an open-source CLI for running macOS and Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Since launch (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061</a>), we've been using it to run AI agents in isolated macOS environments. We needed VMs that could set themselves up, so we built that.<p>Here's what's new in 0.2:<p>*Unattended Setup* \u2013 Go from IPSW to a fully configured VM without touching the keyboard. We built a VNC + OCR system that clicks through macOS Setup Assistant automatically. No more manual setup before pushing to a registry:<p><pre><code>  lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n</code></pre>\nYou can write custom YAML configs to set up any macOS version your way.<p>*HTTP API + Daemon* \u2013 A REST API on port 7777 that runs as a background service. Your scripts and CI pipelines can manage VMs that persist even if your terminal closes:<p><pre><code>  curl -X POST localhost:7777/lume/vms/my-vm/run -d '{\"noDisplay\": true}'\n</code></pre>\n*MCP Server* \u2013 Native integration with Claude Desktop and AI coding agents. Claude can create, run, and execute commands in VMs directly:<p><pre><code>  # Add to Claude Desktop config\n  \"lume\": { \"command\": \"lume\", \"args\": [\"serve\", \"--mcp\"] }\n    \n  # Then just ask: \"Create a sandbox VM and run my tests\"\n</code></pre>\n*Multi-location Storage* \u2013 macOS disk space is always tight, so from user feedback we added support for external drives. Add an SSD, move VMs between locations:<p><pre><code>  lume config storage add external-ssd /Volumes/ExternalSSD/lume\n  lume clone my-vm backup --source-storage default --dest-storage external-ssd\n</code></pre>\n*Registry Support* \u2013 Pull and push VM images from GHCR or GCS. Create a golden image once, share it across your team.<p>We're seeing people use Lume for:\n- Running Claude Code in an isolated VM (your host stays clean, reset mistakes by cloning)\n- CI/CD pipelines for Apple platform apps\n- Automated UI testing across macOS versions\n- Disposable sandboxes for security research<p>To get started:<p><pre><code>  /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)\"\n\n  lume create sandbox --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n  lume run sandbox --shared-dir ~/my-project\n</code></pre>\nLume is MIT licensed and Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3/M4) since it uses Apple's native Virtualization Framework directly\u2014no emulation.<p>Lume runs on EC2 Mac instances and Scaleway if you need cloud infrastructure. We're also working on a managed cloud offering for teams that need macOS compute on demand\u2014if you're interested, reach out.<p>We're actively developing this as part of Cua (<a href=\"https://github.com/trycua/cua\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trycua/cua</a>), our Computer Use Agent SDK. We'd love your feedback, bug reports, or feature ideas.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/trycua/cua\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trycua/cua</a>\nDocs: <a href=\"https://cua.ai/docs/lume\">https://cua.ai/docs/lume</a><p>We'll be here to answer questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670181\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670181</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

This makes sequence trajectories geometrically interpretable and supports vector arithmetic on histories (e.g., A \u2212 B + C style analogies on event trajectories).</p> <p>From the Python side, you primarily interact with a scikit\u2011learn\u2011style estimator:</p> <pre><code>python from event2vector import Event2Vec model = Event2Vec( num_event_types=len(vocab), geometry=&quot;euclidean&quot;, # or &quot;hyperbolic&quot; embedding_dim=128, pad_sequences=True, num_epochs=50, ) model.fit(train_sequences, verbose=True) embeddings = model.transform(train_sequences) </code></pre> <p>There are both Euclidean and hyperbolic (Poincar\u00e9 ball) variants, so you can choose flat vs hierarchical geometry for your event space.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Python users working with discrete event sequences: logs, clickstreams, POS tags, user journeys, synthetic processes, etc.</p> <p>E.g. posts about shopping patterns <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-181632020?source=queue\">https://substack.com/home/post/p-181632020?source=queue</a> or geometry of languages <a href=\"https://sulcantonin.substack.com/p/the-geometry-of-language-families\">https://sulcantonin.substack.com/p/the-geometry-of-language-families</a></p> <p>People who want interpretable, geometric representations of sequences rather than just \u201cit works but I can\u2019t see what it\u2019s doing.\u201d</p> <p>It is currently more of a research/analysis tool and prototyping library than a fully battle\u2011hardened production system, but:</p> <p>It is MIT\u2011licensed and on PyPI (<code>pip install event2vector</code>).</p> <p>It has a scikit\u2011style API (<code>fit</code>, <code>fit_transform</code>, <code>transform</code>, <code>most_similar</code>) and optional padded batching + GPU support, so it should drop into many Python ML workflows.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p><strong>Versus Word2Vec and similar context\u2011window models:</strong></p> <p>Word2Vec is excellent for capturing local co\u2011occurrence and semantic similarity, but it does not model the ordered trajectory of a sequence; contexts are effectively treated as bags of neighbors.</p> <p>Event2Vector, in contrast, explicitly treats the hidden state as an ordered sum of event embeddings, and its training objective enforces that likely future events lie along the trajectory of that sum. This lets it capture sequential structure and trajectory geometry that Word2Vec is not designed to represent.</p> <p>In the paper, an unsupervised experiment on the Brown Corpus shows that Event2Vector\u2019s additive sequence embeddings produce clearer clusters of POS\u2011tag patterns than a Word2Vec baseline when you compose tag sequences and visualize them.</p> <p><strong>Versus generic RNNs / LSTMs / transformers:</strong></p> <p>Those models are more expressive and often better for pure prediction, but their hidden states are usually hard to interpret geometrically.</p> <p>Event2Vector intentionally trades some expressivity for a simple, reversible additive structure: sequences are trajectories in a space where addition/subtraction have a clear meaning, and you can inspect them with PCA/t\u2011SNE or do analogical reasoning.</p> <h1>Python\u2011centric details</h1> <ul> <li>Install: <code>pip install event2vector</code> </li> <li>Github Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/sulcantonin/event2vec_public/tree/main\">https://github.com/sulcantonin/event2vec_public/tree/main</a></li> </ul> <p>Accepts integer\u2011encoded sequences (Python lists / tensors), with optional padding for minibatching.</p> <p>Provides a tiny synthetic quickstart (START\u2192A/B\u2192C\u2192END) that trains in seconds on CPU and plots embeddings with matplotlib, plus a Brown Corpus POS example that mirrors the paper.</p> <p>I\u2019d love feedback from the Python side on:</p> <p>Whether the estimator/API design feels natural.</p> <p>What examples or utilities you\u2019d want for real\u2011world logs / clickstreams.</p> <p>Any obvious packaging or ergonomics improvements that would make you more likely to try it in your own projects.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sulcantonin\"> /u/sulcantonin </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qgaac2/i_built_event2vector_a_scikitstyle_library_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qgaac2/i_built_event2vector_a_scikitstyle_library_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The study systematically investigates how rendering parameters\u2014including the traveling speed of the illusory stroke, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive indentations, and indentation pressure\u2014affect the perceived pleasantness and continuity of the stimulus. Results reveal that higher speeds significantly improved both pleasantness and continuity, with speed emerging as the most influential factor. In contrast, SOA has no significant effect on either perceived pleasantness or continuity. Indentation pressure shows a moderate impact on pleasantness, with high pressures reducing pleasantness but having no significant effect on continuity. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between perceived pleasantness and continuity, underscoring the relevance of the continuity illusion created by sequential indentations with discrete actuators in evoking pleasant sensations. These findings demonstrate the potential of PUC actuators for creating affective touch stimuli and provide preliminary insights into the influence of rendering parameters on affective touch in human-machine and human-robot interactions.",

    "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

    "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

    "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

    "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
    "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

    "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
    "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

    "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

    "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

    "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

    "title": "The Interactive Effects of Negative Emotion and Reward Motivation on Visual Perception",
    "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

    "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

    "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

    "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

This paper surveys the research literature on tactile change detection and blindness under various parameters, including the number of tactors used, the intensity and length of the stimulus, and whether distractors between stimuli (i.e., transients) were used during experimentation, among others. The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",

    "title": "From Restoration to Augmentation: New Approaches to Haptic Feedback for Artificial Limbs",
    "content": "Haptic feedback is essential for precise motor control, making its integration into artificial limbs a critical design challenge. Current approaches to restoring lost tactile input in patients have focused on interfacing with somatosensory pathways at the brain, nerve, or skin level, achieving partial restoration. However, augmentative artificial limbs, devices that provide novel movement capabilities beyond the biological body, pose unique challenges. These limbs lack dedicated sensory pathways, raising fundamental questions about how to deliver tactile feedback for these devices without disrupting existing somatosensory function. A promising direction lies in exploiting intrinsic tactile feedback, which emerges naturally at the interface between wearable devices and the body. When an artificial limb moves or interacts with objects, the skin detects rich tactile cues transmitted through this interface. Amplifying and refining this intrinsic feedback, via materials optimized for transmission of tactile signals and wearable designs, could enable more intuitive and interpretable haptic feedback for augmentative limbs. This approach offers a pathway toward enhancing embodiment and motor control of augmentative artificial limbs.",

    "title": "Neonatal social communication and single genes predict the variability of post-pubertal social behavior in a mouse model of paternal 15q11-13 duplication",
    "content": "Mental illnesses associated with high-risk copy number variations (CNVs) are characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable severity, with their underlying mechanisms remaining inadequately understood. We hypothesized that such phenotypic variability is evident from the neonatal stage and is, at least in part, attributable to individual differences in the expression levels of CNV-encoded genes in the brain. We conducted an analysis of the quantitative and functional structure of neonatal social communication, assessed post-pubertal social interaction, and evaluated the brain expression levels of genes within the same cohort of a mouse model of paternal human 15q11-13 duplication, a high-risk factor variably associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Subsequently, computational methods were utilized to identify predictive variables for the variability of post-pubertal social interaction. Mice harboring the 15q11-13 duplication exhibited distinctive call sequences characterized by diverse connections, which lacked the incentive value necessary for effective social communication with mother mice. The neonatal call sequences and the expression levels of Magel2, along with, to a lesser extent, Herc2 and Ndn, in the prefrontal cortex of the 15q11-13 duplication model were predictive of post-pubertal social interaction. Our findings demonstrate that variability in post-pubertal social interaction, a dimensional characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders, can be predicted by the variability of neonatal social communication and is influenced by the expression levels of specific CNV-encoded genes in the prefrontal cortex. This computational approach has the potential to predict the developmental trajectories of various dimensions of mental illness among CNV carriers in humans and to identify CNV-encoded driver genes in preclinical models, thereby providing potential mechanistic bases for the development of gene-based therapeutic strategies",

    "title": "Common and distinct contributions of the dorsomedial prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices to social episodic memory",
    "content": "The self-reference effect (SRE) refers to the robust mnemonic advantage for self-relevant information and is characterised by a graded pattern spanning the self, close others, and distant others. Despite extensive behavioural evidence, causal evidence for the neural mechanisms supporting the SRE remains limited, particularly during incidental encoding and across source memory, metacognition, and emotional valence. We investigated the causal contributions of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to self-other episodic memory and metacognition using focal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). One hundred participants completed an incidental encoding task in which trait adjectives were rated with reference to the self, a close friend, or a celebrity, under anodal or sham stimulation to either region. Recognition tests assessed item and source memory sensitivity (d') and metacognitive efficiency (meta-d'/d') as a function of agent and emotional valence. Across stimulation conditions, a graded advantage for self-related information was observed in both item and source memory, extending to metacognitive efficiency. Anodal stimulation to either region enhanced recognition for celebrity-referenced items. PPC stimulation additionally biased source memory away from positive and towards negative information. These findings demonstrate shared and dissociable causal roles of dmPFC and PPC in self-other episodic memory.",

    "title": "Locus coeruleus noradrenaline elicits response profiles distinct from natural arousal in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes",
    "content": "During arousal and stress, the locus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline (NA) throughout the brain, including hippocampus. It remains, however, unclear how LC activity contributes to the cellular response profiles observed during natural arousal. Here we directly compared effects of natural arousal and isolated LC activation in mouse CA1 using physiologically titrated optogenetics, combined with fiber photometry of NA and calcium signals, chronic two-photon imaging, and behavioral monitoring. We found that natural arousal robustly activated all three major cell types - astrocytes, pyramidal cells, and inhibitory interneurons - on a population level. In contrast, stimulation of the LC alone exerted a slow inhibitory influence on pyramidal cells and interneurons, with only a subset of interneurons exhibiting a transient activation by LC stimulation. Interneurons, but not pyramidal cells, segregated into functionally consistent LC-responsive subpopulations (activated vs inhibited) with distinct laminar positions in CA1. However, these LC-responsive subpopulations of interneurons did not reliably map onto response subpopulations defined by activity patterns during natural arousal. Astrocytes were strongly activated by both natural arousal and LC stimulation. However, single-cell responses of astrocytes to LC stimulation only partially aligned with their activity during natural arousal responses, indicating distinct driving forces across the two conditions. Together, these results show that LC-driven NA release produces distinct, cell-specific effects that do not align with hippocampal dynamics during natural arousal. Thus, our findings highlight the need to rethink how the locus coeruleus influences the main hippocampal cell types in vivo.",

    "title": "Feeling the music: Audiotactile encoding of temporal structure in the human brain",
    "content": "In everyday situations, like a rock party or an organ concert, we feel music vibrating through our bodies. How do these vibrotactile signals influence music processing? How do they aid auditory scene analysis? Combining psychophysics, fMRI and time-resolved EEG decoding, this work reveals how the brain encodes the temporal structure of music (beat and envelope) across audition and touch and uses this information to guide multisensory integration and segregation in simple and more complex perceptual scenes. Participants experienced monophonic and polyphonic piano pieces through auditory, vibrotactile and audiotactile stimulation. Vibrotactile signals improved the detection of a brief target embedded in music, establishing the functional relevance of audiotactile integration in naturalistic settings. fMRI and EEG multivariate decoding revealed that auditory and tactile beat information converged in planum temporale and parietal operculum, albeit through distinct neural dynamics and representations. Superior temporal cortices reliably encoded envelope information from audition, but only weakly from touch. Nevertheless, vibrotactile signals significantly enhanced neural encoding of auditory beat as early as 100 ms, and envelope representations from 250 ms onward. These encoding benefits were associated with superadditive interactions in primary auditory cortex, where tactile signals sharpen and amplify auditory envelope representations. In complex polyphonic music, touch further amplified the segregation and encoding of temporally coherent auditory streams. Our findings highlight the important, yet largely unexplored influence of touch on auditory processing, enriching music perception and supporting auditory scene analysis in real-world environments.",

    "title": "Cortical astrocytes control stress resilience",
    "content": "Background: Chronic stress exposure is a risk factor for several psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression (MDD), with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) playing a key role in mediating this stress susceptibility. However, most individuals who are exposed to chronic stress are resilient and do not develop psychopathology. Recent evidence suggests that glial cells, especially astrocytes, play an important role in controlling stress-induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior, yet their role in contributing to stress resilience is not understood. Methods: Using fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and RNA-sequencing in male mice, we establish a role for PFC astrocytes in stress resilience. Results: We demonstrate that stress-induced increases in astrocytic calcium activity are both necessary and sufficient for resilience. Bioinformatic analysis reveals robust transcriptional responses in PFC astrocytes that differ between susceptible vs. resilient mice and are unique when compared to astrocytic transcriptional changes in other limbic regions. Comparison with human RNA-sequencing data indicates that molecular changes observed in PFC astrocytes from susceptible mice converge with gene expression changes observed in MDD patients. Conclusions: Together, these data support targeting astrocytes as a potential therapy for negative behavioral consequences following stress exposure and reveal potential molecular mechanisms within PFC astrocytes that could contribute to depressive-like behaviors.",

    "title": "Sequential coupling of sleep oscillations enables concept-neuron reactivation and supports information flow across the human hippocampal-cortical circuit",
    "content": "Effective memory consolidation during sleep is thought to rely on the transfer of reactivated memory traces from the hippocampus to the cortex. However, the mechanisms supporting this essential dialogue across brain areas remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded single-neuron activity (n = 1097) in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of 10 epilepsy patients across 21 nights of sleep. Before sleep, patients engaged in a memory task with stimuli eliciting concept-neuron responses. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, neuronal firing locked to sharp wave-ripples (SWR) revealed a directed flow of information from the hippocampus to cortical targets. Notably, within SWR-driven activity, experience-dependent concept neurons exhibited elevated co-activation both within and across MTL regions, indicating selective reactivation of behaviorally relevant information. Cross-regional co-activation of concept cells was markedly enhanced when hippocampal SWRs coincided with cortical slow oscillation-spindle complexes, suggesting an active role of the cortex in shaping interregional communication. These findings provide evidence that SWRs in humans selectively reactivate experience-related neural ensembles across the hippocampal-cortical network, while synergistic interactions with cortical slow oscillation-spindle events might facilitate effective memory consolidation.",

    "content": "Tactile sensitivity is temporally modulated on a moving limb. Yet the functional significance of this modulation remains unclear. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the temporal dynamics of early somatosensory processing in goal-directed reaching. Participants reached for their unseen left hand while brief vibrations were applied to the moving right index finger in different movement phases. Psychophysical results revealed tactile suppression during reaching, with sensitivity improving around maximum speed relative to the late movement phase. The EEG results were consistent with the psychophysical data. Specifically, the short-latency P45 component, originating in primary somatosensory cortex, was suppressed during reaching, but recovered around maximum speed. Reduced P45 amplitudes were associated with stronger tactile suppression measured behaviorally, linking early cortical activity to perceptual changes. This temporally specific modulation of tactile perception associated with early cortical processing suggests that the somatosensory system dynamically adapts its sensitivity to facilitate sensorimotor control in goal-directed actions.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN,<p>I have been working with regulation-heavy documents lately, and one thing kept bothering me. Flat RAG pipelines often fail to retrieve related articles together, even when they are clearly connected through references, definitions, or clauses.<p>After trying several RAG setups, I subjectively felt that GraphRAG was a better mental model for this kind of data. The Microsoft GraphRAG paper and reference implementation were helpful starting points. However, in practice, I found one recurring friction point: graph storage and vector indexing are usually handled by separate systems, which felt unnecessarily heavy for short-lived analysis tasks.<p>To explore this tradeoff, I built GibRAM (Graph in-buffer Retrieval and Associative Memory). It is an experimental, in-memory GraphRAG runtime where entities, relationships, text units, and embeddings live side by side in a single process.<p>GibRAM is intentionally ephemeral. It is designed for exploratory tasks like summarization or conversational querying over a bounded document set. Data lives in memory, scoped by session, and is automatically cleaned up via TTL. There are no durability guarantees, and recomputation is considered cheaper than persistence for the intended use cases.<p>This is not a database and not a production-ready system. It is a casual project, largely vibe-coded, meant to explore what GraphRAG looks like when memory is the primary constraint instead of storage. Technical debt exists, and many tradeoffs are explicit.<p>The project is open source, and I would really appreciate feedback, especially from people working on RAG, search infrastructure, or graph-based retrieval.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/gibram-io/gibram\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/gibram-io/gibram</a><p>Happy to answer questions or hear why this approach might be flawed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665393\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665393</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

I thought I'd just try and build a mini / puzzle game around the resource gathering aspects of an RTS.<p>Objective: You have a base at the center and you need to mine and \"refine\" all of the resources on the map in as short a time as possible.<p>By default, the game will play automatically, but not optimally (moving and buying  upgrades). You can disable that with the buttons. You can select drones and right click to move them to specific resources patches and buy upgrades as you earn upgrade points.<p>I've implemented three different levels and some basic sounds. I used Phaser at the game library (first time using it). It won't work well on a mobile.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46662399\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46662399</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "title": "Brain-like dynamics in speech representations can emerge through self-supervised learning",
    "content": "Speech representations in the human brain do not simply mirror the instantaneous speech signal; rather, they display several properties that are hypothesized to facilitate the integration of speech sounds into words. In particular, neural encodings of speech maintain information that has dissipated from the acoustics, and have also been argued to abstract over variability in how individual speech sounds are produced. Here, we investigate how such characteristics could arise. We introduce a computational framework that uses modern neural network models from speech technology to examine two factors in particular: the learning mechanism and the learning input. We find that self-supervised models trained without lexical or semantic feedback developed temporal dynamics similar to brain representations, regardless of whether they were trained on speech or non-speech audio. In contrast, only models trained on speech learn to abstract over variability due to word position and phonetic context. Overall, our results suggest that domain-general learning mechanisms can lead to several important properties of speech representations, but in some cases require domain-specific input in order to do so.",

    "title": "In vivo Proximity & Spatial Proteomics with CRISPR Screening Identify STXBP1 as a Protective Modifier of a-synuclein Toxicity in Dopamine Neurons.",
    "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disease of adults involving the loss of dopaminergic neurons after a long, asymptomatic, prodromal period. a-synuclein, LRRK2, and VPS35 are linked to familial PD, however, how these mutations predispose dopamine neurons to death during the early prodromal phases remains unclear. Here, we used in vivo native proximity proteomics (iBioID) and dopaminergic neuron-specific subcellular proteomics across multiple PD models to uncover early alterations preceding neuronal loss. Our analyses identified convergent disruptions in synaptic protein abundance, indicating that presynaptic trafficking defects are early events in PD pathogenesis. Using a targeted CRISPR-based genetic screen in dopamine neurons, we demonstrated that mimicking this misregulation of STXBP1 amplifies vulnerability to a-synuclein, implicating it as a previously underappreciated toxicity buffering factor. These findings highlight convergent mechanisms that sensitize dopamine neuronal degeneration and that presynaptic vesicle SNARE-complex proteins could serve as key targets for disease-modifying therapies in PD and related neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "title": "Impaired temporal prediction mechanisms in dyslexia",
    "content": "Effective speech analysis involves deconstructing the acoustic signal into identifiable linguistic units, which depends on the ability to recognize and anticipate temporal patterns within the speech stream. However, these processes may be less efficient in individuals with dyslexia. This study investigated the effects of temporal context and related temporal predictions in dyslexic adult participants and matched control participants, using an auditory oddball task with non-verbal stimuli. Pure tones were presented in sequences, and participants were requested to discriminate the pitch of target stimuli. The temporal intervals between the sounds varied in regularity across the sequences, thereby creating contexts with different levels of temporal predictability. At the end of each sequence, participants were prompted to evaluate the perceived rhythmicity of the sequence and to assess their own performance in the auditory discrimination task. Dyslexic participants demonstrated overall lower accuracy in discriminating target sounds than controls. They also showed reduced influence of the temporal context of the sequences on response times, while controls responded faster in sequences that were temporally more regular and predictable. Additionally, individuals with dyslexia perceived the rhythmicity of sound sequences less accurately, overestimating the temporal regularity in irregular sequences and underestimating it in regular sequences. They also reported lower overall confidence in their ability to perform the task compared to control participants. Altogether, these findings provide converging evidence for altered temporal prediction abilities in dyslexia, which may impact auditory perception and then impair language processing.",
