    "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

It is written in Rust and, at the moment, it includes implementations for a large collection of popular graph algorithms, including:</p> <ul> <li>Centrality metrics: PageRank, betweenness centrality, etc.</li> <li>Community detection: Algorithms like connected components, Louvain, etc.</li> <li>Heuristics: Solutions for hard graph algorithms, such as Max clique finding.</li> <li>Link prediction: Algorithms like Jaccard coefficients, Adamic-Adar index, etc.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This library is mainly for data scientists, researchers, and software engineers who work with graph datasets and want the ease of use of Python and the speed of a compiled language like Rust, all in one place.</p> <p><strong>Comparison with Alternatives</strong></p> <p>The main goal of the project is to make PyGraphina as feature-rich as NetworkX, but with the performance benefits of a Rust backend. PyGraphina is currently in an early stage compared to more mature projects like <code>rustworkx</code> or <code>graph-tool</code>The focus of the project is to provide application-specific graph algorithms (for applications like link prediction and community detection) out of the box.</p> <p><strong>Github Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/habedi/graphina/tree/main/pygraphina\">https://github.com/habedi/graphina/tree/main/pygraphina</a></p> <p><strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://habedi.github.io/graphina/python\">https://habedi.github.io/graphina/python</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Pomegranate7508\"> /u/No_Pomegranate7508 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1phhv8f/a_highlevel_graph_library_for_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1phhv8f/a_highlevel_graph_library_for_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This study aimed to develop and validate a diagnostic nomogram for diagnosing the severity of ULMD-IS using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data.MethodsThis retrospective analysis included 275 ULMD-IS patients at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to a training group (n = 193) or a validation group (n = 82). The data were preprocessed using HOMER2. In the training group, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression were employed to identify predictive variables and construct the nomogram. The nomogram\u2019s performance was validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsNo significant differences in baseline characteristics, including sex, age, lesion hemisphere, or medical history, were observed between the training and validation groups. LASSO regression analysis identified three independent risk factors: deoxyhemoglobin (HbD) levels in the affected temporal region, total hemoglobin (HbT) levels in the total region, and HbT levels in the unaffected frontopolar region. These factors showed good differentiation ability (training group AUC: 0.766, verification group AUC: 0.861). The model\u2019s goodness-of-fit was confirmed, and it demonstrated a favorable net clinical benefit. Additionally, correlation analysis between these model variables and activities of daily living (ADL) scores revealed no significant relationships (p > 0.05 for all variables), indicating that the identified risk factors may not directly influence ADL performance.ConclusionThis study identified HbD in the affected temporal region, Total HbT levels, and HbT in the unaffected frontopolar region as independent risk factors for diagnosing the severity of ULMD-IS, and a corresponding predictive model was constructed. Given the model\u2019s limited sensitivity, the nomogram should be regarded only as a supplementary reference for objectively assessing post-stroke motor dysfunction; its utility in predicting treatment outcomes and guiding therapeutic choices remains modest and warrants cautious interpretation.",

    "content": "IntroductionSupplementary motor area (SMA) hyperactivity is thought to be a key neural mechanism in tics. This study probed SMA\u2019s role in tic expression, voluntary tic control, and premonitory urge experiences using one session of 1 Hz \u201cinhibitory\u201d repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting SMA in a repeated measures, small-N experimental design.MethodsYouth with Tourette Syndrome (TS) ages 12\u201417 years (N = 14) completed a clinical assessment and MRI to localize SMA. The video-based Tic Suppression Task (TST) quantified tic frequency and urges during conditions of Free-to-Tic, Suppression, and Suppression+Reward. The TST was followed by randomly assigned active 1 Hz (n = 8) or sham rTMS (n = 6) and TST repetition post-stimulation.ResultsActive rTMS led to greater tic frequency reductions during Free-to-Tic (d = 0.34) and Suppression+Reward (d = 0.24) but not Suppression (d = 0.0). A stronger effect size for active rTMS was observed in both suppression conditions (d = 0.26, d = 0.63) when excluding participants classified as baseline \u201cstrong suppressors\u201d (n = 5). Urges did not differ group-wise for Free-to-Tic (d = 0.09) but decreased more following active rTMS in both suppression conditions (d = 0.19, d = 0.52).DiscussionOverall, results suggest that the acute aftereffects of active 1 Hz rTMS to SMA may include reduced natural tic frequency, improved tic controllability, and lower urge intensity, especially while engaged in suppression efforts. Results are consistent with prior literature pointing to SMA hyperactivation in TS and suggests the potential therapeutic value of rTMS.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "content": "Assessing the degree and characteristics of consciousness is central to caring for patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DoC), yet current standard of care is a bedside questionnaire. Using a laminar neural probe we introduce a self-supervised, multi-modal representation learning approach that constructs an interpretable 2-D latent space of brain state from continuous neural recordings. We jointly encode local field potentials (LFPs), single-unit firing rates, and a movement proxy into a time-aware autoregressive VAE (TN-VAE). In rats, pigs and humans undergoing controlled depth anesthesia experiments, the learned latent trajectories nonlinearly, but smoothly, separate four expert-defined states (awake, light, moderate, deep) at (2s) resolution, exceeding the temporal granularity of behavioral scoring (15m). The latent space supports linear readout of both coarse state and individual behavioral components, and its axes align with known physiology: delta/alpha power differentiates unconscious sub-states, while gamma and unit firing distinguish wakefulness. To enable cross-species use and incomplete modality sets, we add lightweight, species-specific stitching layers. This model pretrained on tri-modal rat data and fine-tuned with unimodal (LFP) pig data and unimodal human intraoperative data, successfully separates awake versus anesthetized states in new unseen human subjects, demonstrating zero-shot multi-subject transfer without per-patient calibration. The model further generalizes in a multi-task manner to predict the results of additional stimuli. These results highlight a path toward a foundation model for DoC that generalizes across sessions, subjects, species, and stimuli to enable scalable, continuous brain-state monitoring and clinical decision support.",

    "title": "Age-Related Differences in the Lexical Priming Effect Can Be Predominantly Attributed to Differences in Response Bias",
    "content": "Age-related declines in visual perception challenge older adults' ability to locate and identify objects in noisy (e.g., fog, glare, inadequate lighting) or cluttered visual environments. To compensate, older adults often increase reliance on contextual information, which could be helpful, but may also lead to increased risk for false seeing, reporting expected objects based on contextual information rather than those actually presented, a phenomenon that Jacoby et al., (2012) observed in older adults under challenging viewing conditions. However, it remains unaddressed whether such false seeing is driven by older adults' elevated tendency to rely on context, or by age-related declines in visual perceptual processes. The current study addressed this issue by examining the lexical priming effects in 18 younger and 18 older adults (M = 21.4 years; M = 76.2 years) in Experiment 1, and 13 younger and 13 older adults (M = 21.2 years; M = 74.8 years) in Experiment 2 using a two-alternative, forced-choice (2AFC) paradigm, while controlling for age-related perceptual differences. On each trial, participants identified a visually degraded target word preceded by an identical, semantically related, or unrelated prime. We applied Signal Detection Theory to isolate perceptual sensitivity and response bias. Results revealed that once stimulus parameters were adjusted to eliminate age-differences in performance when the prime was unrelated to the target, age-related differences in target identification in the related priming conditions were predominantly driven by age-related differences in response bias rather than in any residual age-differences in perceptual sensitivity.",

    "title": "N, N-Dimethyltryptamine and harmine formulation shifts metastable topography sequences in the cortex",
    "content": "Classic serotonergic psychedelics are potent modulators of conscious awareness, yet the principles governing their effects on the temporal dynamics of brain activity remain unclear. Dominant theories propose that psychedelics increase the signal diversity and metastability of neural states, but whether this reflects a simple randomization of activity or a more structured reorganization is unknown. Here, we used high-density EEG (n=25) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to delineate the effects of an ayahuasca-inspired formulation (intranasal N,N-DMT and buccal harmine) on the syntax of whole-brain functional states. Using microstate analysis, we show that psychedelic states induced by DMT and harmine are characterized by a profound acceleration of neural dynamics, evidenced by a reduced microstate duration and an increased frequency of state transitions. Despite that, the sequence of microstates became less random, as indicated by a higher first-order Markov statistic. This syntactic restructuring involved a systematic de-prioritization of transitions into one state (M2) and a corresponding increase in the prevalence and accessibility of two other states (M3 and M5). These findings reveal that the psychedelic state leads to a syntactically reconfigured state of heightened metastability. By showing that psychedelics both lead to an accelerated exploration of an expanded repertoire of neural states governed by increased syntactic structure, our findings improve our understanding of neural metastability in psychedelic states.",

    "title": "Leveraging unbiased LC-MS analysis to identify histone post-translational modifications associated with age-related decline of learning and memory",
    "content": "Age-associated cognitive decline is a significant societal challenge, with several neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease becoming prevalent. Normal ageing is associated with several molecular, cellular, and metabolic hallmarks, including epigenetic mechanisms. In particular, dysregulation of post-translational modifications on histone tails is emerging as a mechanism associated with functional decline. The hippocampus is a region of the brain that is essential for the formation of episodic and spatial memories, which are particularly susceptible to age-related decline. In this perspective manuscript, we have used mass spectrometry as an unbiased method to profile histone tail post-translational modifications both at baseline and after contextual fear conditioning (CFC) from young and aged mouse hippocampi to identify age- and activity-dependent changes. Using this approach, we identify epigenetic marks not widely studied in ageing and in activity-induced learning. We propose a framework on how to integrate these epigenetic marks into current knowledge and discuss how to use this new analysis to formulate novel hypotheses that will broaden this field of ageing research. We believe that this work will be of interest to scientists, clinicians and the wider public by making a significant contribution to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for age-associated cognitive decline and by reporting the identification of new mechanisms to focus on.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

    "title": "Retraining dorsal visual pathways improves cognitive skills and executive control networks following mild traumatic brain injury",
    "content": "Background and objectivesMild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) frequently results in persistent cognitive deficits with limited evidence-based rehabilitation options. Visual timing deficits, potentially linked to dorsal visual pathway dysfunction, represent a promising therapeutic target. This study examined whether a novel intervention targeting dorsal visual pathways (PATH) demonstrates superior efficacy compared to conventional cognitive therapies targeting ventral pathway deficits or working memory impairments.MethodsTwenty-four participants (aged 23\u201362 years) with mTBI were randomized to receive one of three interventions over 12 weeks: (1) PATH training targeting dorsal visual pathway function, (2) Orientation Discrimination (OD) targeting ventral pathway pattern discrimination, both of these 20-min interventions followed by 10-min of digit memory exercises, or (3) ReCollect, working memory training. Each intervention consisted of 36 sessions (30 min each, three times weekly). Primary outcome was visual working memory (VWM) performance; secondary outcomes included processing speed, reading speed, auditory working memory, selective attention, and cognitive flexibility assessed via standardized neuropsychological measures. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during resting state and an N-Back task provided neurophysiological validation.ResultsPATH training yielded significantly greater VWM improvements (49%) compared to ReCollect (13%) and OD (8%) interventions. Repeated-measures ANOVA confirmed superior efficacy of dorsal pathway training (significant at p = 0.011). Similar gains for PATH training were also found for processing speed, reading speed, and cognitive flexibility, especially when compared to the OD group, revealing importance of strengthening the dorsal stream before digit memory exercises. MEG analysis revealed PATH-specific activation in not only bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, superior occipital gyri, but also the left anterior temporal lobe and hippocampus, primary motor cortex, and the cerebellum, as well as lower gamma-band noise, suggesting enhanced neural timing, attention, working memory, memory consolidation and retrieval mechanisms beyond the targeted dorsal pathways.ConclusionDorsal visual pathway retraining followed by targeted working memory exercises demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy for cognitive rehabilitation following mTBI compared to conventional approaches. The intervention promotes beneficial neuroplasticity extending to memory-related brain regions, supporting its potential as a targeted, mechanistically-informed therapy for post-concussive cognitive deficits.",

    "content": "Quantum-like modeling (QLM)\u2014quantum theory applications outside of physics\u2014are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose, as well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not only concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also with QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT)\u2014a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical \u201coscillatory cognition\u201d of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision-making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, that is, \u201cmental entanglement.\u201d We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing \u201clocal observables\u201d and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on \u201cmental entanglement\u201d detection using the EEG/MEG technique.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.07117v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This chapter explores human creativity in AI-assisted learning environments through the lens of student agency. We begin by examining four theoretical perspectives on agency, including instrumental, effortful, dynamically emergent, and authorial agency, and analyze how each frames the relationship between agency and creativity. Under each theoretical perspective, we discuss how the integration of generative AI (GenAI) tools reshapes these dynamics by altering students' roles in cognitive, social, and creative processes. In the second part, we introduce a theoretical framework for AI agentic engagement, contextualizing agency within specific cognitive, relational, and ethical dynamics introduced by GenAI tools. This framework is linked to the concept of Mini-c creativity, emphasizing personal relevance and self-directed learning. Together, these perspectives support a shift from viewing creativity as product-oriented to understanding it as a process of agentive participation and meaning-making. We conclude with two directions for future research focused on the creative process and performance in AI-assisted learning.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.06910v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models enable unscripted conversations while maintaining a consistent personality. One desirable personality trait in cooperative partners, known to improve task performance, is agreeableness. To explore the impact of large language models on personality modeling for robots, as well as the effect of agreeable and non-agreeable personalities in cooperative tasks, we conduct a two-part study. This includes an online pre-study for personality validation and a lab-based main study to evaluate the effects on likability, motivation, and task performance. The results demonstrate that the robot's agreeableness significantly enhances its likability. No significant difference in intrinsic motivation was observed between the two personality types. However, the findings suggest that a robot exhibiting agreeableness and openness to new experiences can enhance task performance. This study highlights the advantages of employing large language models for customized modeling of robot personalities and provides evidence that a carefully chosen agreeable robot personality can positively influence human perceptions and lead to greater success in cooperative scenarios.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.06834v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) make high-quality instruction accessible. However, the lack of face-to-face interaction makes it difficult for instructors to obtain feedback on learners' performance and provide more effective instructional guidance. Traditional analytical approaches, such as clickstream logs or quiz scores, capture only coarse-grained learning outcomes and offer limited insight into learners' moment-to-moment cognitive states. In this study, we propose COIVis, an eye tracking-based visual analytics system that supports concept-level exploration of learning processes in MOOC videos. COIVis first extracts course concepts from multimodal video content and aligns them with the temporal structure and screen space of the lecture, defining Concepts of Interest (COIs), which anchor abstract concepts to specific spatiotemporal regions. Learners' gaze trajectories are transformed into COI sequences, and five interpretable learner-state features -- Attention, Cognitive Load, Interest, Preference, and Synchronicity -- are computed at the COI level based on eye tracking metrics. Building on these representations, COIVis provides a narrative, multi-view visualization enabling instructors to move from cohort-level overviews to individual learning paths, quickly locate problematic concepts, and compare diverse learning strategies. We evaluate COIVis through two case studies and in-depth user-feedback interviews. The results demonstrate that COIVis effectively provides instructors with valuable insights into the consistency and anomalies of learners' learning patterns, thereby supporting timely and personalized interventions for learners and optimizing instructional design.",

However, most existing user studies are conducted primarily with adult groups, overlooking teenagers who are also engaging more frequently with AI technologies. Based on previous theories about teenage education and psychology, this study investigates the correlation between teenagers' psychological characteristics and their trust in AI chatbots, examining four key variables: AI literacy, ego identity, social anxiety, and psychological resilience. We adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining an online survey with semi-structured interviews. Our findings reveal that psychological resilience is a significant positive predictor of trust in AI, and that age significantly moderates the relationship between social anxiety and trust. The interviews further suggest that teenagers generally report relatively high levels of trust in AI, tend to overestimate their AI literacy, and are influenced by external factors such as social media.",

    "title": "Memory Power Asymmetry in Human-AI Relationships: Preserving Mutual Forgetting in the Digital Age",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.06616v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in personal and professional relationships, a new kind of power imbalance emerges from asymmetric memory capabilities. Human relationships have historically relied on mutual forgetting, the natural tendency for both parties to forget details over time, as a foundation for psychological safety, forgiveness, and identity change. By contrast, AI systems can record, store, and recombine interaction histories at scale, often indefinitely. We introduce Memory Power Asymmetry (MPA): a structural power imbalance that arises when one relationship partner (typically an AI-enabled firm) possesses a substantially superior capacity to record, retain, retrieve, and integrate the shared history of the relationship, and can selectively deploy that history in ways the other partner (the human) cannot. Drawing on research in human memory, power-dependence theory, AI architecture, and consumer vulnerability, we develop a conceptual framework with four dimensions of MPA (persistence, accuracy, accessibility, integration) and four mechanisms by which memory asymmetry is translated into power (strategic memory deployment, narrative control, dependence asymmetry, vulnerability accumulation). We theorize downstream consequences at individual, relational/firm, and societal levels, formulate boundary-conditioned propositions, and articulate six design principles for restoring a healthier balance of memory in human-AI relationships (e.g., forgetting by design, contextual containment, symmetric access to records). Our analysis positions MPA as a distinct construct relative to information asymmetry, privacy, surveillance, and customer relationship management, and argues that protecting mutual forgetting, or at least mutual control over memory, should become a central design and policy goal in the AI age.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.06591v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Explainable AI (XAI) presents useful tools to facilitate transparency and trustworthiness in machine learning systems. However, current evaluations of system explainability often rely heavily on subjective user surveys, which may not adequately capture the effectiveness of explanations. This paper critiques the overreliance on user satisfaction metrics and explores whether these can differentiate between meaningful (actionable) and vacuous (placebic) explanations. In experiments involving optimal Social Security filing age selection tasks, participants used one of three protocols: no explanations, placebic explanations, and actionable explanations. Participants who received actionable explanations significantly outperformed the other groups in objective measures of their mental model, but users rated placebic and actionable explanations as equally satisfying. This suggests that subjective surveys alone fail to capture whether explanations truly support users in building useful domain understanding. We propose that future evaluations of agent explanation capabilities should integrate objective task performance metrics alongside subjective assessments to more accurately measure explanation quality.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.06534v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In response to calls for open data and growing privacy threats, organizations are increasingly adopting privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy (DP) that inject statistical noise when generating published datasets. These techniques are designed to protect privacy of data subjects while enabling useful analyses, but their reception by data users is under-explored. We developed documentation that presents the noise characteristics of two Wikipedia pageview datasets: one using rounding (heuristic privacy) and another using DP (formal privacy). After incorporating expert feedback (n=5), we used these documents to conduct a task-based contextual inquiry (n=15) exploring how data users--largely unfamiliar with these methods--perceive, interact with, and interpret privacy-preserving noise during data analysis.\n  Participants readily used simple uncertainty metrics from the documentation, but struggled when asked to compute confidence intervals across multiple noisy estimates. They were better able to devise simulation-based approaches for computing uncertainty with DP data compared to rounded data. Surprisingly, several participants incorrectly believed DP's stronger utility implied weaker privacy protections. Based on our findings, we offer design recommendations for documentation and tools to better support data users working with privacy-noised data.",

Comments provide valuable external perspectives for understanding, questioning, and complementing the text, but their potential is hindered by disorganized and unstructured presentation. Few studies have explored embedding comments directly into reading. As an exploratory step, we propose CommentScope, a system with two core modules: a pipeline that classifies comments into five types and aligns them with relevant sentences, and a presentation module that integrates comments inline or as side notes, supported by visual cues such as colors, charts, and highlights. Technical evaluation shows that the hybrid \"Rule+LLM\" pipeline achieved solid performance in semantic classification (accuracy=0.90) and position alignment (accuracy=0.88). A user study (N=12) further demonstrated that the sentence-end embedding significantly improved comment discovery accuracy and reading fluency while reducing mental demand and perceived effort.",

AI-generated future selves simulate meaningful encounters with a digital twin decades in the future.

How might a text-based chatbot, a voice-only system, or a photorealistic avatar shape present-day decisions and our feeling of connection to the future? We report a randomized controlled study (N=92) evaluating three modalities of AI-generated future selves (text, voice, avatar) against a neutral control condition. We also report a systematic model evaluation between Claude 4 and three other Large Language Models (LLMs), assessing Claude 4 across psychological and interaction dimensions and establishing conversational AI quality as a critical determinant of intervention effectiveness. All personalized modalities strengthened Future Self-Continuity (FSC), emotional well-being, and motivation compared to control, with avatar producing the largest vividness gains, yet with no significant differences between formats. Interaction quality metrics, particularly persuasiveness, realism, and user engagement, emerged as robust predictors of psychological and affective outcomes, indicating that how compelling the interaction feels matters more than the form it takes. Content analysis found thematic patterns: text emphasized career planning, while voice and avatar facilitated personal reflection.

Here, we establish the thermodynamic bounds on energy consumption in quasi-static analog DNNs by mapping modern feedforward architectures onto a physical free-energy functional. This framework provides a direct statistical-mechanical interpretation of quasi-static DNNs. As a result, inference can proceed in a thermodynamically reversible manner, with vanishing minimal energy cost, in contrast to the Landauer limit that constrains digital hardware. Importantly, inference corresponds to relaxation to a unique free-energy minimum with F_{\\min}=0, allowing all constraints to be satisfied without residual stress. By comparison, training overconstrains the system: simultaneous clamping of inputs and outputs generates stresses that propagate backward through the architecture, reproducing the rules of backpropagation. Parameter annealing then relaxes these stresses, providing a purely physical route to learning without an explicit loss function. We further derive a universal lower bound on training energy, E< 2NDkT, which scales with both the number of trainable parameters and the dataset size.",

Beginning with the advent of foundation models, the rate at which human and artificial intelligence interact with each other has exceeded any anticipated quantitative figures. The close engagement led both bits of intelligence to be impacted in various ways, which naturally resulted in complex confluences that warrant close scrutiny. Recent advances, such as DeepSeek, exemplify this interplay: the novel contributions, we argue, draw indirect inspiration from biological principles like modular neural specialization and sparse episodic encoding, addressing computational bottlenecks while aligning with human-inspired scalability. In the sequel, using a novel taxonomy, we shall explore this interplay between human and machine intelligence, focusing on the crucial role humans play in developing ethical, responsible, and robust intelligent systems. We briefly delve into various aspects of implementation inspired by the mechanisms underlying neuroscience and human cognition. In addition, we propose future perspectives, capitalizing on the advantages of symbiotic designs to suggest a human-centered direction for next-generation developments, focusing on the augmentation role of AI.

The goal of this study was to identify functional connectivity brain patterns underlying Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)-related characteristics in fifty-five adults (31 female) who endorsed heavy alcohol use. We hypothesized that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the Salience (SN), Frontoparietal (FPN), and Default Mode (DMN) networks would reflect self-reported recent and lifetime alcohol use, laboratory-based alcohol seeking, urgency, and sociodemographic characteristics related to AUD. To test our hypothesis, we combined the triple network model (TNM) of psychopathology with a multivariate data-driven approach, regularized partial least squares (rPLS), to unfold concurrent functional connectivity (FC) patterns and their association with AUD-related characteristics. We observed three concurrent associations of interest: i) drinking and age-related cross communication between the SN and both the FPN and DMN; ii) family history density of AUD and urgency anticorrelations between the SN and FPN; and iii) alcohol seeking and sex-associated SN and DMN interactions. These findings provide an integrative interpretation for many individual findings reported in the literature relating functional connectivity signatures and AUD factors. Moreover, we identified a set of neural mechanisms and brain regions concomitant with AUD-related characteristics that can serve as potential treatment targets across clinical and preclinical models.",

This framework differs from previous accounts of memory by reliance on statistics as a representation of memory, the use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics at each summarization step, and the hypothesis of a process that is complex and expensive. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.06134v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Early forecasting of individual cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is central to disease evaluation and management. Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($\\alpha$) and biological ($\\beta$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05990v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Contemporary ML separates the static structure of parameters from the dynamic flow of inference, yielding systems that lack the sample efficiency and thermodynamic frugality of biological cognition. In this theoretical work, we propose \\textbf{Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI)}, a formal framework rooted in algebraic topology that unifies learning and memory as phase transitions of a single geometric substrate. Central to our theory is the \\textbf{Homological Parity Principle}, which posits a fundamental dichotomy: even-dimensional homology ($H_{even}$) physically instantiates stable \\textbf{Content} (stable scaffolds or ``what''), while odd-dimensional homology ($H_{odd}$) instantiates dynamic \\textbf{Context} (dynamic flows or ``where''). We derive the logical flow of MAI as a topological trinity transformation: \\textbf{Search $\\to$ Closure $\\to$ Structure}. Specifically, we demonstrate that cognition operates by converting high-complexity recursive search (modeled by \\textit{Savitch's Theorem} in NPSPACE) into low-complexity lookup (modeled by \\textit{Dynamic Programming} in P) via the mechanism of \\textbf{Topological Cycle Closure}. We further show that this consolidation process is governed by a topological generalization of the Wake-Sleep algorithm, functioning as a coordinate descent that alternates between optimizing the $H_{odd}$ flow (inference/wake) and condensing persistent cycles into the $H_{even}$ scaffold (learning/sleep). This framework offers a rigorous explanation for the emergence of fast-thinking (intuition) from slow-thinking (reasoning) and provides a blueprint for post-Turing architectures that compute via topological resonance.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.06934v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Accurately predicting individual neurons' responses and spatial functional properties in complex visual tasks remains a key challenge in understanding neural computation. Existing whole-brain connectome models of Drosophila often rely on parameter assumptions or deep learning approaches, yet remain limited in their ability to reliably predict dynamic neuronal responses. We introduce a Multi-Path Aggregation (MPA) framework, based on neural network steady-state theory, to build a whole-brain Visual Function Profiles (VFP) of Drosophila neurons and predict their responses under diverse visual tasks. Unlike conventional methods relying on redundant parameters, MPA combines visual input features with the whole-brain connectome topology. It uses adjacency matrix powers and finite-path optimization to efficiently predict neuronal function, including ON/OFF polarity, direction selectivity, and responses to complex visual stimuli. Our model achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.84+/-0.12 for ON/OFF responses, outperforming existing methods (0.33+/-0.59), and accurately captures neuron functional properties, including luminance and direction preferences, while allowing single-neuron or population-level blockade simulations. Replacing CNN modules with VFP-derived Lobula Columnar(LC) population responses in a Drosophila simulation enables successful navigation and obstacle avoidance, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in guiding embodied behavior. This study establishes a \"connectome-functional profile-behavior\" framework, offering a whole-brain quantitative tool to study Drosophila visual computation and a neuron-level guide for brain-inspired intelligence.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.06492v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The human visual system exhibits non-uniform spatial resolution across the visual field, which is characterized by the cortical magnification factor (CMF) that reflects its anatomical basis. However, current approaches for quantifying CMF using retinotopic maps derived from BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are limited by the inherent low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI data and inaccuracies in the topological relationships of the retinotopic maps. In this study, we introduced a new pipeline to quantify planar CMF from retinotopic maps generated from the population receptive field (pRF) model. The pipeline projected the 3D pRF solutions onto a 2D planar disk, using optimal transport (OT) to preserve local cortical surface areas, and applied topological smoothing to ensure that the resulting retinotopic maps maintain their topology. We then estimated 2D CMF maps from the projected retinotopic maps on the planar disk using the 1-ring patch method. Applying this pipeline to the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7T dataset, we revealed previously unobserved CMF patterns across the visual field and demonstrated individual differences among the 181 subjects. The pipeline was further validated on the New York University (NYU) 3T dataset, showing reliable and repeatable results. Our study provided new analytical methods and offered novel insights into visual processing.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.06280v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the last decade, there have been major advances in clusterless decoding algorithms for neural data analysis. These algorithms use the theory of marked point processes to describe the joint activity of many neurons simultaneously, without the need for spike sorting. In this study, we examine information-theoretic metrics to analyze the information extracted from each observed spike under such clusterless models. In an analysis of spatial coding in the rat hippocampus, we compared the entropy reduction between spike-sorted and clusterless models for both individual spikes observed in isolation and when the prior information from all previously observed spikes is accounted for. Our analysis demonstrates that low-amplitude spikes, which are difficult to cluster and often left out of spike sorting, provide reduced information compared to sortable, high-amplitude spikes when considered in isolation, but the two provide similar levels of information when considering all the prior information available from past spiking. These findings demonstrate the value of combining information measures with state-space modeling and yield new insights into the underlying mechanisms of neural computation.",

    "title": "Curvature-based machine learning method for automated segmentation of dendritic spines",
    "content": "Recent advances in connectomics have been led by high-resolution reconstruction of large volumes of neural tissues using electron microscopy (EM), providing unprecedented insights into brain structure and function. Dendritic spines--dynamic protrusions on neuronal dendrites--play crucial roles in synaptic plasticity, influencing learning, memory, and various neurological disorders. However, current spine analysis methods often rely on manual annotation of subcellular features, limiting their ability to handle the complexity of spines in dense dendritic networks. This paper introduces a novel automated computational framework that integrates discrete differential geometry, machine learning, and 3D image processing to analyze dendritic spines in these intricate environments. By generating distributions of spine morphology from high resolution images including many thousands of spines, our approach captures subtle variations in spine shapes, offering a nuanced understanding of their roles in synaptic function. This framework is tested on multiple EM datasets, with the aim of enhancing our understanding of synaptic plasticity and its alterations in disease states. The proposed method is poised to accelerate neuroscience research by providing a scalable, objective, and comprehensive solution for spine analysis, uncovering insights into the role of spine geometry for neural function.",

    "title": "Protective effect of prior knowledge in ageing",
    "content": "Visual perception depends on both sensory input and prior knowledge, and the quality of these information sources changes across the lifespan. As people age, accumulated knowledge, and its influence on perception, tend to increase, while declines in low-level visual functions reduce input quality and bias perception toward prior information. Yet, the combined effects of these changes on higher-level visual perception remain unclear, partly because concurrent cognitive decline may complicate the use of stored knowledge. In this study, we examined how prior knowledge shapes visual perception in younger (<40 years) and older (>60 years) adults using ambiguous two-tone images, whose recognition depends on prior knowledge. Providing participants with the original photographs used to generate the two-tones triggered perceptual reorganisation, improving recognition in both groups. Although older adults recognised fewer two-tones overall - a pattern linked to reduced visual acuity - they showed a comparable benefit from prior knowledge when cued. These findings suggest that, despite age-related sensory decline, the ability to draw on prior knowledge remains robust in older adulthood and may help preserve perceptual function.",

Our simulations reproduced key findings from prior computational studies with the Larter-Breakspear model, demonstrating its cross-species translation to the mouse. This included the emergence of chaotic dynamics and network synchrony as a function of coupling and delay parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Calcium, Sodium, and Potassiumrelated parameters each critically shape the global dynamic regimes and that the response to external stimuli is highly sensitive to calcium concentrations. This work represents the first integration of the Larter- Breakspear model into a mouse-scale connectome, validating previous results in a new context. In addition, it establishes a framework for a detailed exploration of synchrony, ion dependency, and stimulus reactivity. By linking molecular simulations, genetic data, and mouse electrophysiology, this approach holds promise for mechanistic insights into neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and epilepsy.",

    "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
    "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

    "title": "Ventral Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons Regulate Decision-Making or Motor Impulsivity Differentially across Learning and Biological Sex",
    "content": "<p>Dopaminergic transmission within the ventral striatum is broadly implicated in risk/reward decision-making and impulse control, and the rat gambling task (rGT) measures both behaviors concurrently. While the resulting indices of risky choice and impulsivity correlate at the population level, dopaminergic manipulations rarely impact both behaviors uniformly, with changes in choice more likely when dopaminergic transmission is altered during task acquisition. Although the task structure of the rGT remains constant, the relative importance of ventral striatal dopamine (DA) signals relevant for reward prediction versus impulse control may vary as learning progresses; the former should dominate while rats learn the probabilistic contingencies of the task, whereas suppression of premature responses becomes more valuable once a decision-making strategy is established and exploited. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) critically influence reinforcement learning by modulating dopamine (DA) release and gating periods of DA-facilitated neuroplasticity. We therefore hypothesized that ventral striatal CINs (vsCINs) could influence reward learning or impulse control during task acquisition or stable performance, respectively. Using chemogenetics in Sprague Dawley rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>), we found support for this hypothesis: activation and inhibition of vsCINs once behavior was stable increased and decreased motor impulsivity in both sexes but had no effect on choice patterns. In contrast, activating and inhibiting vsCINs during task acquisition did not alter motor impulsivity but instead decreased and increased risky choice, respectively. Notably, the former effect was only observed in males and the latter in females. We conclude by proposing testable predictions regarding acetylcholine&ndash;DA interactions that may explain sex differences.</p>",

    "title": "Orofacial Movements: Individuality and Stereotypy When Mice Move a Single Whisker to Touch",
    "content": "<p>A key function of the brain is to move the body through a rich, complex environment. When rodents engage with their environment, they move their whiskers as they extract tactile information. Even though the study of whisking has a long history, the details of individual whisker movements bilaterally, of nose movement, of stereotypy and variability in an active whisking to touch behavior are unknown. Here we trained five head-fixed male and 11 female mice in a go-cue task to move a whisker to touch a sensor. Our analysis of orofacial movements shows that mice specifically control movement of the whisker they use to touch and that as they move their whiskers, they move their nose and apply forces on the head post in a manner that reflects the behavioral epoch, i.e., whether go-cue triggered movement had begun or a whisker was touching the sensor. Importantly, mice control the setpoint, amplitude, and frequency of movement of whiskers bilaterally and individually. Additionally, even though mice achieved the goal of the task&mdash;to touch the sensor within 2&nbsp;s&mdash;how they coordinated movement of the nose and forces on head post with movement of individual whiskers was stereotyped and related to the distance they needed to move a whisker to touch the sensor. Our work shows how stereotyped mouse behavior can be, and it emphasizes both the level of fine motor control mice can exert over individual whiskers and the extent of facial movements in a goal-directed whisking-to-touch task.</p>",

    "content": "<p>How is spatial attention deployed in mental images? Mental imagery is often assumed to share mechanisms with visual perception and visual working memory. Top-down, endogenous spatial attention in both visual perception and working memory modulates behavior and parieto-occipital alpha-band activity. However, working memory captures only a subset of mental imagery, which can also draw upon long-term memory. Here, we ask whether and how spatial attention operates in mental images derived from general knowledge in long-term memory and whether it recruits the same neural mechanisms as visual perception. We recorded EEG in 28 healthy volunteers (13 males, 15 females) as they performed two discrimination tasks with spatial cues (70% valid): one involving the mental visualization of a long-term memory map (a map of France) and the other using visual stimuli. We show that spatial attention shortens response times in both tasks, but through distinct mechanisms. Behavioral attentional benefits were uncorrelated across tasks, and spatial attention in mental imagery engaged distinct neural mechanisms, with frontal rather than posterior alpha activity modulation. We further reveal fundamental differences in the spatial structures of mental imagery and visual perception. Altogether, our results show that mental images drawn from long-term semantic memory are spatially organized and are amenable to spatial attention deployment, but the underlying neural mechanisms differ from those of visual perception. Our results thus point to marked differences between mental imagery from long-term memory and visual perception.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Understanding speech while ignoring competing speech streams in the surrounding environment is challenging. Previous studies have demonstrated that attention shapes the neural representation of speech features. Attended streams are typically represented more strongly than unattended ones, suggesting either enhancement of the attended or suppression of the unattended stream. However, it is unclear how these complementary processes support attentional filtering and speech comprehension on different hierarchical levels. In this study, we used multivariate temporal response functions to analyze the EEG signals of 43 young adults (24 women), examining the relationship between the neural tracking of acoustic and higher-level linguistic features and a fine-grained speech comprehension measure. We show that the neural tracking of word and phoneme onsets and word level linguistic features in the attended stream predicted comprehension at the individual single-trial level. Moreover, acoustic tracking of the ignored speech stream was positively correlated with comprehension performance, whereas word level linguistic neural tracking of the ignored stream was negatively correlated with comprehension. Collectively, our results suggest that attentional filtering during speech comprehension requires target enhancement as well as distractor suppression at different hierarchical levels.</p>",

    "title": "Repeated Morphine Exposure Reversibly Impairs Spike Generation and Repetitive Firing in a Functionally Distinct Subpopulation of Orexin Neurons",
    "content": "<p>Orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides regulate numerous essential functions including sleep/wake state stability and reward processing. Orexin synthesizing neurons respond to drug cues and undergo structural changes following persistent drug exposure. Postmortem brains from opioid users and opioid-treated rodents have orexin somata that become ~20% smaller and ~50% more numerous and are postulated to promote hypermotivation for drug seeking though increased orexin release. Biophysical considerations suggest that the decreased soma size should increase cellular excitability; however, the impact of chronic opioids on firing ability, which drives peptide release, has not been explored. To test this, we assessed the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons by whole-cell recordings in slices from male orexin-EGFP mice treated for 2&nbsp;weeks by daily morphine or saline injections. Paradoxically, we found that while daily morphine decreased the average soma size, it impaired excitability in a subpopulation of orexin neurons identified by electrophysiological criteria as \"H-type\" while entirely sparing \"D-type\" neurons. This impairment was manifest by smaller, broader action potentials, variable firing, and a downscaling of firing gain. These adaptations required more than a single morphine dose and recovered, along with soma size, after 4&nbsp;weeks of passive withdrawal. Taken together, these observations indicate that daily opioid exposure differentially impacts H-type orexin neurons and predicts that the ability of these neurons to encode synaptic inputs into spike trains and to release neuropeptides becomes impaired in conjunction with opioid dependence.</p>",

Thirty-two participants (23 female) were engaged in a shape discrimination task, while auditory cues predicted which specific shape would likely appear. Frequency analysis revealed significant oscillatory fluctuations of predicted shape representations in the pre-stimulus window in the alpha band (10&ndash;11&nbsp;Hz).

Our findings demonstrate that sensory predictions are embedded in pre-stimulus alpha oscillations and modulate subsequent perceptual performance, providing a neural mechanism through which the brain deploys perceptual predictions.</p>",

    "title": "Identifying Key Regulators in Odorant Receptor Trafficking",
    "content": "<p>Odor detection in mammals is primarily mediated by odorant receptors (ORs), the largest family of G-protein-coupled receptors, expressed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs; Buck and Axel, 1991). However, most ORs exhibit little or no cell surface expression in nonolfactory cell types (Lu et al., 2003; Hague et al., 2004). While the accessory protein RTP1 and RTP2 enhance the expression of certain ORs, we hypothesized that additional proteins coregulated with RTP1 and RTP2 during OSN maturation may further enhance OR cell surface expression (Saito et al., 2004; Zhuang and Matsunami, 2007). To test this, we developed a computational pipeline based on publicly available single-cell transcriptomic data to create an interactive tool for exploring gene expression during OSN maturation. Using this tool, we identified genes coregulated with Rtp1 during olfactory development. Three genes&mdash;Gfy, Clgn, and Syt1&mdash;exhibited transcriptional profiles similar to Rtp1. When coexpressed with an OR, these genes, in combination with Rtp1, promoted cell-surface expression of the tested ORs. Importantly, we demonstrated a physical interaction between Syt1 and an OR (Or1ad1) via co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting a novel role for Syt1 in OR trafficking or stabilization. We also observed localization of Syt1 protein in OSN cilia in both male and female mice. Together, these findings provide new insights into OSN development and the molecular mechanisms underlying OR biogenesis, paving the way for further research into the functional regulation of the olfactory systems.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Decision-making is influenced by both expected rewards and social factors, such as who offers the outcomes. Therefore, although a reward might originally be independent of social factors, the two elements are closely related. However, whether and how they are processed separately or conjointly remains unclear. Here, we show that neurons in distinct subnuclei of the amygdala encode expected reward and face reality, a vital aspect of face perception. Although these encoding processes are distinct, they rely on partially shared neuronal circuits with characteristic temporal dynamics. Two male macaque monkeys made saccades under different social and reward contexts by viewing facial images with independent attributes: reality (a real monkey or a cartoon face) and associated reward (large or small). The stimulus image was presented twice per trial: during initial stimulus encoding (S1) and before saccades were made (S2). A longer gaze duration for the eye region of the monkeys compared with cartoons indicated more robust social engagement with realistic faces. During S1, a similar number of lateral nucleus neurons encoded either reality only, with a monkey-image preference; reward only, with a large-reward preference; or both. Conversely, neurons in the basal and central nuclei primarily encoded reward, preferring large- versus small-reward&ndash;associated face images. Reward-dependent modulation continued after S1 but was more conspicuous during S1 in the basal nucleus and during both S1 and S2 in the central nucleus.

    "title": "Restoration of sFRP3 Preserves the Neural Stem Cell Pool and Spatial Discrimination Ability in a Mouse Model of Alzheimers Disease",
    "content": "<p>Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have an increased incidence of seizures, which worsen cognitive decline. Using a transgenic mouse model of AD neuropathology that exhibits spontaneous seizures, we previously found that seizure activity stimulates and accelerates depletion of the hippocampal neural stem cell (NSC) pool, which was associated with deficits in neurogenesis-dependent spatial discrimination. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that drive seizure-induced activation and depletion of NSCs are unclear. Here, using mice of both sexes, we performed RNA-sequencing on the hippocampal dentate gyrus and identified differentially expressed regulators of neurogenesis in the Wnt signaling pathway that regulates many aspects of cell proliferation. We found that the expression of sFRP3, a Wnt signaling inhibitor, is altered in a seizure-dependent manner and might be regulated by FosB, a seizure-induced transcription factor. Increasing sFRP3 expression prevented NSC depletion and improved spatial discrimination, suggesting that the loss of sFRP3 might mediate seizure-driven impairment in cognition in AD model mice and perhaps also in AD.</p>",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "title": "Brain-immune interactions generate pathogen-specific sickness states",
    "content": "In nature, animals encounter diverse pathogens that trigger specific peripheral defense programs and elicit sickness behavior, a set of stereotyped physiological and behavioral changes thought to promote host fitness. Most studies to date have relied on one or a few mouse models of infection, limiting insights into pathogen-specific neuroimmune interactions that generate sickness. We hypothesized that different pathogens might elicit distinct sickness states by engaging different cell types and brain circuits. Using inflammatory models representing bacterial, viral, allergic, parasitic or colitis conditions, we assessed sickness across scales: organismal (behavior and physiology); cellular (brain-wide neural activity); and molecular (single-cell in situ transcriptomics in hypothalamus areas associated with social and homeostatic functions affected during sickness). Remarkably, immune challenges elicited unique repertoires of changes across all scales. Our findings reveal pathogen-specific sickness states encoded by the brain across scales, thereby broadening our understanding of how infections make us sick.",

    "title": "Sleep disturbance is associated with increased repetitive sensorimotor behaviour in autism but not in learning/intellectual disabilities or ADHD: A comparative study",
    "content": "The interplay of sleep and sensorimotor processing is a fundamental neurobiological process crucial for well-being. Individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions like autism, ADHD, and intellectual/learning disabilities frequently experience both significant sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Although a link between these domains is established, it is unclear whether this relationship and its functional impact are consistent across different neurodevelopmental conditions. In a cross-sectional dataset of individuals aged 5-21 (n = 212), we investigated whether the interplay between sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours differs between individuals diagnosed with autism (IQ>70), ADHD, a learning disability (IQ<70), as well as typically developed controls. We also examined whether interactions between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours predicts distinct functional outcomes between neurodevelopmental groups. We found that individuals with autism (IQ>70) were most strongly affected by both sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Crucially, we show that while a robust bidirectional link between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours exists across the entire sample, sleep problems amplify repetitive sensorimotor behaviours more strongly only in autistic people than in typical controls. Contrary to previous work, we found that learning disabled children and adolescents engaged in more repetitive sensorimotor behaviour but did not experience more sleep disturbance. Although the interaction between sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours did not determine functional outcomes in autistic people, the interplay of sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviour impaired social awareness in people with ADHD. These findings challenge a transdiagnostic view that treats the reinforcement between sleep and sensorimotor problems as a general marker of neurodevelopmental conditions. Understanding the distinct pathways between sleep and waking behaviours is a critical step toward developing personalized, mechanistic interventions targeting specific sleep and sensory impairment profiles in different neurodevelopmental conditions.",

    "title": "Convergent pathways with impaired inhibition at the frontal cortex are the outcome of differential alterations in the male and female schizophrenia model",
    "content": "Schizophrenia is associated with impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and disrupted synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), yet the biological mechanisms underlying these deficits may differ between sexes. Here, we used a double-hit rat model, combining perinatal NMDA receptor blockade and post-weaning social isolation, to dissect sex-specific alterations in inhibitory circuit maturation, synaptic plasticity, and prefrontal function. Male double-hit rats exhibited robust schizophrenia-like behaviors, reduced parvalbumin (PV), OTX2, and perineuronal net (PNN) expression, decreased GAD67 levels, and increased DNA damage in PV interneurons, together indicating impaired inhibitory maturation and weakened plasticity. In contrast, females showed milder behavioral deficits but displayed increased PV and OTX2 intensities, enhanced cFos activation in excitatory neurons, and transcriptomic upregulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and synapse assembly pathways, suggesting a state of heightened or dysregulated plasticity. Despite these divergent molecular trajectories, in vivo electrophysiology revealed a shared functional endpoint in both sexes: a shift from paired-pulse inhibition to facilitation during basolateral amygdala-evoked responses, reflecting impaired GABAB-mediated inhibitory feedback. Pharmacological blockade of GABAB, but not GABAA, receptors reproduced this phenotype, identifying GABAB signaling as a key mechanism underlying cortical disinhibition. Altogether, our findings reveal that males and females reach convergent prefrontal inhibitory deficits through sex-specific molecular pathways, underscoring the importance of sex as a biological variable in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia.",

In part, MS results in loss of normal autonomic activity that contributes to disease-associated pathology such as neurogenic bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. Yet little is known of the impacts of MS on peripheral autonomic neurons that directly innervate these target organs. In this study, we measured changes in properties of neurons of the mouse major pelvic ganglion (MPG) associated with two different levels of severity in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Our data show that bladder function and physiological properties of MPG neurons are altered in association with EAE, and differ between less and more severe clinical scores associated with disease progression. EAE results in decreased bladder function measured by decreased urine output and increased micturition pressures. In the most severely affected animals, action potentials (APs) show increased half-widths as a result of decreased maximum decay slopes leading to overall broader and longer APs and lower maximum firing frequency. These changes in AP properties are associated with differences in ion channel subunit expression as well. KCNA1-4, KCNN3, SCN2A1 and SCN3A mRNA levels in MPGs decreased with disease severity. Taken together, our data indicate that peripheral autonomic neurons are fundamentally altered in EAE, suggesting that longer-term therapeutic approaches for MS could target these neurons directly to potentially help ameliorate neurogenic target organ dysfunction.",

    "title": "Coordination of spike timing among the neurons of the cerebellum",
    "content": "We tend to think of neurons as either excitatory or inhibitory, but certain neurons chemically inhibit their downstream targets while electrically exciting their neighbors. For example, in the cerebellum, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) inhibit Purkinje cells (P-cells) via release of GABA but promote spiking in each other via gap junctions. What is gained by having an inhibitory neuron excite its neighbor? Here, we recorded activities of P-cells and MLIs as marmosets performed saccadic eye movements and found that spike timing in pairs of neighboring neurons of the same type exhibited a mathematical regularity: as firing rates increased, rate of spikes that were within 1ms of each other grew disproportionately while 2-4ms intervals were suppressed. To uncover the purpose of this coordination, during saccades we recorded thousands of neuron triplets in which two MLIs converged onto a single target P-cell. When the MLIs spiked within 1ms of each other, they produced superposition of their individual effects on their target; a deep inhibition followed by a post-inhibitory rebound. However, when the MLIs spiked 2-4ms apart, the two spikes interfered with each other, producing partial cancellation. Thus, electrical coupling between inhibitory neurons orchestrated their spike timing so that as firing rates increased, the temporal intervals that induced downstream superposition were promoted while the intervals that caused interference were suppressed.",

    "title": "Detection and quantification of planar traveling waves in the EEG using spherical phase fitting",
    "content": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the spatiotemporal dynamics of oscillatory brain activity. Recordings at various scales have shown oscillations propagating as waves over cortical space, both at small and large scales. The most common waves observed in the EEG are planar waves, formed by a synchronized wavefront propagating in a consistent direction (e.g., posterior-anterior). These waves have been linked to diverse perceptual and cognitive measures. However, their quantification has faced issues due to the inherently noisy EEG signal and its ambiguous spatial localization. Existing methods employ restrictive windows of analysis (e.g., lines of electrodes) or rely on wave motifs extracted from the data. A specific algorithm for detecting planar waves is still lacking. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis pipeline for this purpose, comprising three steps: first, genuine oscillatory activity is extracted from the EEG as clusters. The spatial phase gradient is then fit using a spherical wave model. Finally, stable waves are extracted from the time series of fits. We validate our method using simulations over a physiological range of parameters. Using a forward model, we test EEG wave detection for propagation along different pathways at the source level. Lastly, we apply our analysis to real EEG recordings, targeting alpha oscillations during visual stimulation and at rest. In summary, our method provides a reliable algorithm for detecting planar waves in the EEG. Given the emerging functional roles of traveling waves in perception and cognition, this could potentially be utilized in a wide range of future studies.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "Cognitive effects of placebo antipsychotics: Investigating their mechanisms using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a cognitive test and a self-referential task",
    "content": "Placebos modulate neurocognitive processes. We examined whether a fully deceptive antipsychotic-placebo changes cognition not only by enhancing arousal and attention but also by changing self-representations, namely, by adding that of being under a treatment related to psychosis and by weakening the binding of experience to reality. Drug-naive healthy participants (N = 83) were split into a group (N = 40) who took a pill described as an antipsychotic and a no- pill control group (N = 43). Participants performed a cognitive test (CogTest), that is, a semantic categorization task and a self-referential role judgment task (SRT). Behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. In the CogTest, placebos showed faster response times and higher accuracy than no-pills. This cognitive improvement was associated with more negative occipito-temporal early ERPs (OTEEs), larger central P2s (CentP2s), and larger late positive potentials (LPPs), with the latter correlating with response times. As in the literature, CentP2s were maximal in the SRT, possibly because it maximally stimulates the binding of the stimulus to long-term self-representations. The larger CentP2s and LPPs for placebos than for no-pills in the CogTest were thus tentatively related to the binding of the stimulus with egocentric self-representations, temporarily enriched by the addition of the representation of being on drug. On the contrary, the more negative OTEEs were related to a weaker binding to allocentric ones, preventing a strong binding of experience with reality. The smaller N400s observed for placebos than for no-pills in both tasks were related to greater openness to new experiences.",

    "title": "Transcranial focused ultrasound induces source localizable cortical activation in resting state humans when applied concurrently with transcranial electric stimulation",
    "content": "The effects of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) on the human brain are poorly understood. Currently, the field is at odds with whether tFUS is subthreshold modulating the brain's excitability towards other stimuli, producing suprathreshold neural stimulation on its own, or if it even has a spatially specific non-auditory induced affect. Herein, we investigated the ability of tFUS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and a novel combination of the two (transcranial electro-acoustic stimulation; tEAS) to evoke cortical target-location specific activity in 27 resting state humans with whole brain electroencephalography recordings. In none of the exogenous event related potentials did tFUS or tDCS result in location-specific activations. However, the co-modulatory combination of tEAS did, providing evidence that tFUS has a location-specific subthreshold modulatory effect. We propose a minimally modified Hodgkin Huxley model that explains our results and provides a unifying framework for the field-wide observed effects (or lack thereof) of tFUS.",

    "title": "Examining excitation-inhibition modulation during social processing using functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy",
    "content": "An imbalance of brain excitation-inhibition has been implicated in social communication function across neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. Recent advances in functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) allow non-invasive measurement of dynamic changes in excitation-inhibition neurometabolites (glutamate and GABA), revealing potential links with cognitive processes. This study used functional MRS (fMRS) to investigate whether socially-laden stimuli modulate excitatory or inhibitory neurometabolites, and whether modulation relates to social function. Forty neurotypical adults (18-40 years; 20 male) underwent 3T MRI, with fMRS data acquired using a J-difference edited MRS sequence. GABA+macromolecules (GABA+) and glutamate+glutamine (Glx) were quantified in a right social brain region (superior temporal/temporoparietal junction [STG/TPJ]) and a control region (occipital cortex). Participants viewed a fixation cross (rest; 5 min), silent video clips of social interaction, and a flashing checkerboard as control stimulus (5 min each; counterbalanced). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) assessed social function. There were no significant differences between resting and functional (social or checkerboard) GABA+ or Glx levels (ps<.05), although Bayesian analyses showed evidence for decreased STG/TPJ GABA+ and increased occipital cortex Glx for checkerboard compared to rest. Higher SRS-2 scores were associated with higher resting STG/TPJ Glx but not GABA+, and functional metabolite levels were not associated with SRS-2 scores (ps>.1). Sliding time window analyses suggest reduced Glx in social brain during social and visual stimulation. Despite sound data collection and analysis techniques, shifts in Glx and GABA+ following social stimuli were minimal. Future research could utilise more challenging social stimuli and examine alternate social brain regions.",

    "title": "Region-specific associations between cerebral arterial elasticity and grey matter volume: Evidence for lateral prefrontal vulnerability",
    "content": "Background: Ageing is associated with increased cardiovascular health risks and disproportionate atrophy in frontotemporal brain. Regional cerebral arterial elasticity correlates with regional grey matter volume, with stronger associations frontally and in older adults. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is linked to preserved brain structure and greater arterial elasticity, while sex differences exist in the timing of vascular versus structural changes. This study examines whether regional cerebral arterial elasticity in frontotemporal cortex mediates the association between age and corresponding grey matter volume decline, and whether sex and/or CRF moderate this relationship. Methods: We analysed data from 162 healthy adults (60-70 years) with structural MRI and diffuse optical tomography of the cerebral arterial pulse (Pulse-DOT) from the ACTIVate cohort. CRF was estimated from demographic and physiological measures. Pulse Relaxation Function (PReFx), an optical index of regional arterial elasticity, was measured across 28 frontal, temporal, and parietal regions of interest (ROI). Grey matter (GM) volume was quantified for corresponding ROIs. Mediation and moderated mediation models tested whether PReFx mediated the relationship between age and GM volume at bilateral frontal and temporal ROIs, and whether biological sex or CRF moderated this relationship. Results: Regional bivariate correlations identified associations between age, PReFx and GM volume across multiple ROIs, which PReFx and GM volume being associated primarily in left frontal and temporal areas. PReFx partially mediated the effect of age on GM volume in a left mid-inferior frontal ROI, accounting for approximately 16% of the total age effect and this relationship was only evident in females. Although higher CRF was associated with greater PReFx, it did not moderate the relationship between age, PReFx and GM volume. Conclusions: Consistent with cascade models of neurovascular aging, cerebral arterial stiffening was found to partially explain the effect of increasing age on frontal GM volume, even in this highly age-restricted and high functioning cohort. This effect was only significant over the left prefrontal cortex, consistent with greater vulnerability of frontal brain and associated cognitive functions. It was also exclusively present in females, who had better cardiovascular health, larger grey matter volume and greater arterial elasticity than males. These findings are consistent with pulse-DOT measures of cerebral arterial elasticity being more sensitive to subclinical brain structural variability.",

    "title": "Visual Semantic Encoding and Identification of Naturalistic Movies via High-Density Diffuse Optical Tomography",
    "content": "Understanding how the brain represents meaning in real-world contexts is essential for both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications. Brain encoding and decoding models from naturalistic stimuli provide a powerful window into semantic representations. Yet, existing approaches rely on a constrained scanning environment, or on conventional fNIRS, which has been limited to sparse sampling and/or block-design paradigms. Here, we tested whether high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), an advanced high-density tomographic optical imaging method, can support semantic encoding and decoding using naturalistic movies. We collected 3.5 hours of naturalistic movie viewing data from six participants using stimuli labeled with 1,708 categories. Encoding models robustly predicted voxel-level responses, yielding single semantic category maps consistent with prior fMRI studies. In complementary decoding analyses, we showed that DOT responses captured sufficient semantic content to identify which clips participants viewed. To assess organization across individuals, we identified a shared low-dimensional semantic space that captures common semantic dimensions. Finally, clustering analyses revealed interpretable higher-order semantic dimensions like social and animate agents, objects vs natural organisms, and textural scenes, consistently mapped across the cortex. These findings demonstrate that DOT can recover distributed, high-dimensional semantic representations from naturalistic movies, bridging fMRI-level semantic mapping with the accessibility of optical imaging.",

    "title": "Brain-AI Alignment in Naturalistic Movies",
    "content": "Naturalistic paradigms offer a powerful window into human cognition, but it remains difficult to link rich, continuous movie content to distributed brain activity in an interpretable way. In this study, I use a multimodal large language model (Gemini) as an automated \"semantic annotator\" to bridge naturalistic movie stimuli, brain responses, and cognitive performance. Using the Human Connectome Project movie-watching dataset, I segmented the film into 293 overlapping clips, prompted Gemini to rate each clip on 11 psychologically interpretable dimensions, and simultaneously extracted clip-wise BOLD activation patterns from the fMRI images in 360 cortical parcels. In this way, the AI and the brain effectively \"watch\" the same movies in parallel. For each parcel, I then fit linear regression models to predict clip-to-clip variation in movie-evoked responses from these features. Gemini-derived features robustly predicted movie-evoked responses in temporal, medial parietal, and lateral frontal association cortex, but explained little variance in unimodal somatosensory, dorsal parietal, insular, and piriform regions. Feature-weight maps recapitulated known functional specializations, and features with the largest global influence overlapped with the most explainable parcels. Partial least squares analysis revealed that individual differences in resting-state connectivity strength and semantic explainability covaried along an asymmetric intrinsic axis: strongly integrated sensory-opercular systems at rest were associated with poorer AI predictability, whereas a smaller set of dorsal and medial association regions showed enhanced alignment. Finally, regional AI explainability in medial parietal and left perisylvian association areas was positively related to fluid and crystallized cognitive abilities. Together, these findings demonstrate that prompt-defined, interpretable features from foundation models provide a simple and scalable framework for quantifying brain-AI alignment in naturalistic settings, offering a practical bridge between biological and artificial semantic representations.",

    "title": "Genetic Background and Sex Modulate Androgen Responses in Human Brain Microphysiological System",
    "content": "Sex steroids shape human brain development, yet the cellular and molecular consequences of androgen addition need further exploration. Here, we used a human neural organoid model - brain microphysiological system (bMPS), derived from nine induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to model the impact of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent non-aromatizable androgen. All lines differentiated reproducibly into electrically active, neuron-glia-oligodendrocyte organoids expressing robust androgen-signaling components. DHT was bioavailable, elicited nuclear androgen receptor (AR) translocation and increased organoid size in most cell lines, consistent with androgen-responsive mTOR and metabolic pathway activation. Bulk RNA-seq across nine lines revealed that transcriptional responses varied across donor backgrounds, but DHT-responsive genes converged on mitochondrial energetics, lysosomal function, glycoprotein processing, apoptosis, and mTOR signaling. Cell-type expression profiling showed an androgen-driven shift primarily in male lines toward astrocytic profiles with reductions in oligodendrocyte, oligodendrocyte progenitor (OPC), excitatory, and inhibitory neuronal signatures, supported by immunohistochemistry and AR enrichment in astrocytes and OPCs. DHT also altered neurodevelopmental pathways, increasing variation in synaptic pruning and decreasing variation in neuronal migration, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis and seizure status of donors moderating these effects more strongly than sex. Baseline transcriptional differences distinguished iPSC lines which responded more strongly to DHT from weak responders: responders displayed enhanced synaptic maturity and reduced ECM gene expression. Using isogenic XX/XY lines, we found that differences in sex-chromosome expression exceeded DHT-induced changes and that DHT decreased expression of inhibitory neuron genes in males and increased it in females. Finally, DHT induced extensive DNA methylation changes, targeting HOX genes, patterning, and synaptic genes. Collectively, these findings reveal that androgen signaling shapes transcription, cell populations, and epigenetic landscapes in a genetic background-dependent manner. This work contributes to understanding how androgens influence human brain development and highlights how in vitro models can contribute to representing inter-individual variability in neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Rather than returning to the bimodal dendrite and axon size distribution seen in WT, LgDel L 2/3 PN dendrite and axon growth in vitro increases unimodally in response to NAC. In parallel, altered expression of 22q11-deleted genes and presumed downstream targets are unchanged. Instead, novel antioxidant defense and neuronal growth genes are differentially expressed: some generally NAC-regulated, others responsive only in the context of 22q11 deletion. Apparently, NAC ameliorates L 2/3 PN developmental pathology without restoring WT cell states or typical expression of mutant genes or their downstream targets. NAC also elicits differential expression of antioxidant defense genes in 22q11-deleted L 2/3 PN - but not L 5/6 counterparts - in the developing postnatal LgDel mouse cortex, rather than modulating 22q11 genes or downstream targets. These NAC-dependent, L 2/3 PN-selective in vivo cellular and transcriptional changes differ substantially from those in primary culture. Thus, despite some in vitro and in vivo parallels, the NAC therapeutic response that diminishes oxidative stress-related L 2/3 PN circuit and behavioral pathology due to 22q11 deletion has a unique in vivo signature.",

    "title": "Striatal ensembles specify and control granular forelimb actions",
    "content": "The ability of the brain to control specific fine actions is crucial for survival. The striatum is a critical brain center for both movement and learning, and its dysfunction underlies numerous movement disorders. Whereas activity in the striatum has been classically viewed as invigorating and reinforcing movements, recent studies suggest that striatal activity encodes specific movements. However, it is not known how granular this activity is, and if it indeed controls specific ongoing movements. We designed a task where mice performed two minimally-different forelimb actions, consisting of a push or pull isometric force on an immobile joystick, and imaged the activity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsolateral striatum using 2-photon microscopy. We observed that striatal activity encoded both the preparation and execution of specific actions, even when those actions were not reinforced. Furthermore, both populations of D1 and D2-MSNs - classically viewed as promoting versus inhibiting movement - equally encoded action identity. We developed a closed-loop system to model and stimulate action-specific neural ensembles deep in the brain, using holographic optogenetics through a GRIN lens. Stimulation of action-specific ensembles of both D1- and D2-MSNs increased the force of ongoing actions, but only when the ensemble stimulated was congruent with the ongoing action. These results reveal that specific ensembles of both D1- and D2-MSNs causally control specific ongoing actions, as granular as different muscle co-contractions of the same forelimb. Such granularity provides a mechanistic framework for understanding how striatal dysfunction can produce highly specific movement impairments in Huntington's disease and dystonia.",

    "title": "Characterising longitudinal dynamics of infant neurodevelopment using functional change point detection",
    "content": "Habituation is an early-developing cognitive process linked to early learning whereby irrelevant stimuli are filtered out; it can be assessed using neuroimaging tools, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, conventional fNIRS analysis approaches typically assume linear time invariance and analyse summary statistics of the data, potentially limiting insight into the nature of the changing evoked haemodynamic response. Functional data analysis (FDA) is a branch of statistics which treats entire mathematical functions as the unit of analysis rather than discrete points; within this framework, functional change point (FCPt) detection can identify significant changes in data structure, such as the mean haemodynamic response function. Using infant fNIRS data from a rural Gambian population (n= 204) recorded using a habituation and novelty detection paradigm, the use of functional change point detection with wild binary segmentation was implemented to identify structural changes in the evoked haemodynamic response. Group-level analysis from participants assessed at 5-, 8- and 12mo of age identified structural change corresponding to the evoked haemodynamic response in locations consistent with previous analyses. Further analyses indicated consistent habituation at 8- and 12mo and an age-related shift in the timing of decreasing haemodynamic responses, suggesting older infants in the first year of life habituate more rapidly to auditory stimuli. These results provide novel evidence to support the use of FDA and FCPt detection in the fNIRS field more widely, as well as improving understanding of the development of habituation during early infancy.",

Unlike simple API wrappers, it focuses on the <strong>pre-processing pipeline</strong> required to make extraction reliable in production.</p> <p>It implements a &quot;Waterfall&quot; extraction strategy: it attempts fast text parsing first (using <code>pypdf</code>), falls back to layout analysis (<code>pdfplumber</code>), and finally triggers a local OCR engine (<code>Tesseract</code>) only if necessary. It then allows you to map this raw text to a strict Pydantic model using a pluggable backend.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> Python developers building ETL pipelines, ERP integrations, or financial data processors who need more than just a raw string from an LLM. It is designed for those who need strict type safety and architectural flexibility (e.g., swapping validation rules without rewriting core logic).</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Vs.

In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

We build a Cognitive Drift Index (CDI), confirm its three dimensions, and use a small calibration run to set reasonable ranges. We then map CDI to governance action bands. Using health short videos as a case, we estimate path effects with a weighted least squares ANOVA and test robustness. The steps lead to the same pattern, which supports the protocol\u2019s design and practical use.

    "content": "Social isolation and perceived loneliness are increasingly recognized as serious public health concerns, with extensive evidence linking them to adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Defined, respectively, as the objective lack of social interactions and the subjective feeling of insufficient connection, both conditions are present across various age groups and are associated with elevated risks of cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders. Epidemiological studies have also identified a strong association between chronic social isolation and the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), potentially mediated by dysregulated stress responses, immune function, and endocrine signaling. Animal models of social deprivation have proven instrumental in elucidating the biological underpinnings of these effects, revealing disruptions in neurotransmitter systems and in the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis, with important downstream metabolic alterations. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms linking social isolation to MetS and CVD, with a focus on oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired autophagy. A deeper understanding of these pathways is essential to guide the development of targeted interventions and to reduce the long-term health burden associated with social disconnection.",

    "title": "From Skin to Cortex: End-to-End Spiking Neural Network Simulation of Tactile Information Flow",
    "content": "Autonomous systems and neuroprosthetic devices demand real-time tactile processing under strict energy and latency constraints. Designing these systems using neuromorphic principles, where communication is event-based and node activity is sparse, could improve their speed and energy efficiency. Here we present an end-to-end spiking neural network model of the ascending tactile pathway, from mechanoreceptors in the skin in humans (or whisker follicles in rodents) to cortical neurons, that operates in an event-driven neuromorphic fashion. The model comprises distinct anatomical stages: three types of mechanoreceptor afferents, the trigeminal ganglion, the brainstem, the thalamic nucleus, and three cortical layers, connected in a feed-forward hierarchy. We demonstrate the model responses to both rodent whisker deflection and human fingertip skin displacement, using information-theoretic analysis, pairwise correlation, and stimulus decoding at each layer. Our results show that tactile information is efficiently encoded and transformed at each stage: stimulus features are represented with high fidelity and reduced redundancy as signals ascend. Notably, simple linear or Bayesian decoders can reliably classify stimulus features from single-neuron activity in the thalamus and cortex for low-noise inputs, highlighting the emergence of robust neural representations. This open-source model is the first to include the mechanosensory periphery in a full tactile pathway simulation, enabling researchers to study how perturbations at any stage affect tactile encoding. Moreover, the network is well-suited for deployment on low-power, real-time neuromorphic hardware, facilitating the development of multi-layer signal processing and tactile navigation algorithms.",

    "title": "Microbiome-behavior coupling shapes infant adaptation to early maternal unpredictability",
    "content": "We asked whether infant microbiome composition, together with infants' behavioral responses to early maternal unpredictability, can offer novel mechanistic insights into behavioral phenotypic variation in human development. Maternal unpredictability was computed as the entropy rate of transitions among maternal sensory signals during naturalistic mother-infant interaction (n=256 dyads; 2-6 months). Infant visual orienting behavior (VOB) was indexed by infants' simultaneous gaze shifts to and from the mother. Higher maternal unpredictability predicted more frequent VOB shifts, indicating a mature-for-age profile, and longitudinally forecast poorer inhibitory control at 19-28 months. A subgroup of infants with high maternal unpredictability and high VOB had inhibitory control outcomes closer to those of infants who experienced low maternal unpredictability, suggesting VOB strategy might buffer against the effects of high maternal unpredictability. In participants with metagenomic data (n=93), VOB was associated with taxonomic and functional gut microbial profiles along a Bifidobacterium breve to Bifidobacterium longum axis. Neuroactive gene-set enrichment analysis linked VOB to increase in tryptophan synthesis and glutamate synthesis genes. In contrast, maternal unpredictability showed depletions of GABA and tryptophan synthesis in the unique-effects model and, when VOB and the maternal unpredictability by VOB term were included, enrichment of acetate synthesis and quinolinic acid degradation. Notably, the maternal unpredictability by VOB interactions for tryptophan and glutamate were negative, indicating that the VOB-pathway coupling attenuates as unpredictability increases. Together, these findings support a framework in which maternal unpredictability is the environmental challenge, infant VOB expresses the behavioral strategy, and microbial metabolism modulates whether that strategy is biochemically feasible.",

    "content": "Functional asymmetry is a fundamental feature of human brain organization, yet existing measures of functional connectivity asymmetry rely mainly on univariate indices that miss distributed pattern structure. We introduce the Pattern Dissimilarity of Hemispheric Functional Connectivity (PDHC), a multivariate metric that quantifies the pattern-level distance between each individual's left- and right-hemisphere connectivity architecture. In over one thousand adults, PDHC showed high test-retest reliability, cross-atlas robustness, and strong individual specificity. Network analyses indicated that hemispheric similarity is anchored in conserved sensorimotor and subcortical systems, whereas higher-order networks drive divergence. Developmental data from infancy through early adulthood revealed a characteristic trajectory: dissimilarity declines sharply early in life and increases modestly thereafter. Twin and Turner syndrome samples further demonstrated moderate heritability and sensitivity to X-chromosome dosage. PDHC thus provides a reliable and individualized metric of hemispheric functional architecture, offering a scalable tool for probing lateralization across development, genetics, cognition, and clinical conditions.",

    "title": "Dual role of Spreading Depolarization in the epileptic focus",
    "content": "Spreading Depolarizations (SDs) are often associated with epileptic discharges. While SDs are traditionally thought contributing to the postictal depression and termination of epileptic discharges, seizures may also occur during SDs or may even follow SDs suggesting that interactions between SD and seizures are more complex. Here, we examined the interactions between SD and epileptic activity by spatially separating the epileptic focus and the site of SD initiation. Epileptic focus was induced by local intracortical injection of the potassium channel blocker 4-AP combined with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine, whereas extrinsic SDs were evoked by distal high potassium application. We found that extrinsic SDs promoted seizure-like events (SLEs) when the SD wave approached the epileptic focus, followed by suppression of epileptic activity when SD spread through the focus. The timing of SLE relatively SD varied at different recordings sites, with SLEs occurring before, during or after SD arrival depending on electrode position along the trajectory of SD propagation between the SD initiation site and the epileptic focus. During intracortical recordings, the proconvulsive effects of SD were associated with a wave of pre-SD neuronal excitation reaching the epileptic focus. The epileptic focus per se also demonstrated a resistance to the SD invasion. Thus, the interactions between SD and epileptic focus are not limited to postictal depression, and SDs may also promote epileptic activity in the hyperexcitable cortex.",

    "title": "Causal inference and functional dynamics of a visuomotor network demonstrate excitatory/inhibitory alterations in Multiple Sclerosis",
    "content": "Balanced excitation and inhibition are fundamental for stable brain dynamics. In multiple sclerosis (MS), this balance is thought to be altered, yet its impact on the visuomotor network function and disease progression remains unclear. This study uses information from Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and The Virtual Brain (TVB) alongside clinical measures to provide a causal and network-level perspective on MS pathophysiology. We defined a visuomotor network based on previous work, including bilateral primary visual cortex (V1), left primary motor cortex (M1), left supplementary motor and premotor cortex (SMAPMC), left cingulate cortex (CC), left superior parietal lobule (SPL), and right cerebellar lobule VI (CR). We analysed data from 9 healthy volunteers (HV) and 17 people with MS (pwMS) who underwent multimodal MRI including a visually-guided variable grip-force event-related task and resting-state functional MRI, as well as diffusion-weighted imaging. Our DCM analysis indicated that the best-fitting model was the same for both groups, suggesting preserved visuomotor network architecture. However, pwMS showed altered effective connectivity during task (from SPL to M1: excitatory in HV, inhibitory in pwMS) and rest (from V1 to M1: excitatory in HV, inhibitory in pwMS; from SPL to M1, from M1 to SMAPMC, and from CR to V1: inhibitory in HV, excitatory in pwMS). During task execution, grip-force modulations revealed altered feedback connectivity patterns in pwMS as motor demand increased, indicating a shift from the positive coupling seen in HV to negative coupling across most connections. Effective connectivity alterations in task and resting-state fMRI were associated with clinical measures, including disability and motor reaction time. Connectivity changes involved visuomotor and cerebellar circuits and differed between task execution and rest, indicating context-specific network dynamics. Network-level simulations further linked reduced excitatory gain to slower responses, showing the role of excitation/inhibition balance in performing a visuomotor task. Together, these findings identify excitatory and inhibitory alterations as key mechanisms of network functional disruption in MS and demonstrate the potential of multiscale modelling to bridge neurophysiological alterations with clinical performance.",

    "content": "Adults are able to orient their attention between different (often fleeting) sensory cues that present to different senses (\"crossmodal attention\"), but we cannot assume that this is the case in early life. Here we report the findings of a study in which we probed the presence of tactile to visual crossmodal links in spatial attention using event related potentials (ERP) gathered from the scalp electroencephalograms (EEG) of 5- (n = 19) and 8-month-old (n = 19) infants. Whilst recording EEG, we presented 5- and 8-month-old participants with vibrotactile stimuli on one of their hands, followed by visual stimuli on the same (Congruent) or the opposite (Incongruent) hand, or no touch at all (No probe). During the presentation of these stimuli the infants' eyes were oriented centrally. We subtracted No probe trials from Congruent and Incongruent trials to yield visual evoked potentials (VEPs) free from the influence of prior somatosensory processing. Comparably to prior findings in adults, 8-month-olds' first negative component of the VEP was enhanced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the probe when the visual probe was spatially congruent with the tactile cue. No crossmodal effect was observed in the 5-month-olds, indicating developments in the crossmodal coordination of attention in the first year of life.",

    "title": "Effects of rTMS on swallowing function and neuroimaging features in post-stroke dysphagia",
    "content": "IntroductionDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is common after stroke and can lead to complications like malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and increased mortality. Recovery is driven by neural reorganization, yet traditional interventions focus on managing swallowing difficulties rather than restoring brain function. Neuromodulatory approaches like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show potential for promoting brain plasticity and recovery. While rTMS has demonstrated efficacy in improving swallowing after stroke, few studies have explored its neural mechanisms at the brain level, as opposed to focusing on motor-evoked potentials recorded from peripheral muscles.MethodsThis study examined the effects of 5\u202fHz rTMS on post-stroke dysphagia by targeting the contralesional mylohyoid cortical area. Resting-state fMRI was employed to investigate the neural correlates of rTMS effects. Local brain activity was measured using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), and percentage amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF), while network connectivity was assessed with graph theory analysis.ResultsrTMS reduced spontaneous activity in the contralesional middle frontal gyrus and putamen, and in the ipsilesional insula and middle frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis), regions that were hyperactive at baseline in dysphagic patients. Altered network topology in the left medial superior frontal gyrus suggested connectivity reorganization.ConclusionThese preliminary findings support rTMS as a promising adjunct therapy for post-stroke dysphagia by inducing cortical plasticity, as demonstrated by changes in both regional activity and network topology. Further validation in studies with larger samples is needed.",

    "title": "Macroscopic quantum effects in the brain: new insights into the fundamental principle underlying conscious processes",
    "content": "Empirical findings indicate that conscious states are inextricably linked to long-range synchronized activity patterns that result from phase transitions and exhibit the key features of self-organized criticality. This article builds a bridge between these neurophysiological characteristics of consciousness and the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which provides the appropriate methodological resources for explaining the origin of phase transitions and critical dynamics. An essential ingredient of QED is a fluctuating ocean of energy, the ubiquitous electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF), consisting of a spectrum of normal modes. It can be deduced from QED-based model calculations that the resonant interaction of the ZPF with the glutamate pool of cortical microcolumns is an important prerequisite for the initiation of phase transitions, giving rise to macroscopic quantum effects that play a crucial role in modulating the activity of ion channels and regulating the neuronal firing rate. The firing rate of pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons determines the excitatory-inhibitory balance, which has been identified as the essential control parameter for establishing and maintaining the critical regime. Thus, taking all available pieces of evidence into account, profound new insights take shape, namely, that self-organized criticality arises from a bottom-up orchestration process involving the ZPF and that the fundamental principle behind the formation of conscious states is the resonant coupling of the brain to the ZPF. This coupling causes an amplification of the dynamically relevant ZPF modes, suggesting that the ZPF holds the key to the understanding of consciousness and that the necessary condition for the formation of a conscious state is the selective excitation of ZPF modes. These insights pave the way for novel experimental paradigms designed to systematically manipulate conditions in the brain, thereby collecting new data that can be used to empirically substantiate the significance of resonant brain-ZPF interaction for the formation of conscious states.",

    "title": "The BrainHealth Project study protocol: a scalable digital approach to measuring and promoting multidimensional brain health across the lifespan",
    "content": "BackgroundOptimization of brain health is a focal point in medical science, yet data regarding measuring, improving, and preserving lifelong brain health are lacking. This void demands an objective, change-sensitive measure of brain health and proven strategies to strengthen brain performance. The BrainHealth Project addresses these key issues, drawing upon neuroplasticity evidence of persistent modifiability of brain function across the lifespan. This landmark study aims to (i) evaluate and refine multidimensional change indices of brain health, (ii) evaluate the impact of evidenced-based cognitive strategies and lifestyle interventions on improving/maintaining brain health, and (iii) elucidate the mechanisms associated with brain health gains/losses.MethodsThis quantitative, longitudinal, interventional, open-label, single-arm clinical trial aims to recruit 100,000 generally healthy adults ages 18\u2013100 and evaluate changes for 10 years or longer. Assessments, coaching, and training are conducted online through the secure BrainHealth Platform, allowing utilization tracking. The BrainHealth Index (BHI) \u2013 a multidimensional assessment \u2013 is offered at baseline and every 6 months. Participants have access to coaching every 3 months and continual access to self-paced trainings and resources. The primary outcome is the composite BrainHealth Index score and its empirically derived subdomain scores: Clarity (cognitive health), Connectedness (social health), and Emotional Balance (mental health). The BHI includes validated measures sensitive to change, including gains or losses associated with behavior change and integration of cognitive strategies into daily life. This Index contrasts with traditional assessments focused primarily on detecting cognitive decline or diagnosing pathological conditions, yet it, too, has been found to be sensitive to small incremental losses. The primary online training, SMART (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Tactics), is a strategy-based program validated with 25+ years of research. SMART promotes improvements in neural health, cognition, wellbeing, connectedness, and real-life function, previously reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Statistical approaches focus on individual prediction using nonlinear models trained with large samples and on assessing mechanisms influencing gains or losses on brain health metrics.DiscussionThis research extends prior RCT evidence to a longitudinal, epidemiologic approach, leveraging digital health and machine learning tools to deliver a generalizable measure of longitudinal brain health and actionable ways to achieve precision brain health. By integrating advanced statistical methods and large-scale data, the BrainHealth Project aims to provide medicine and society with accurate, multidimensional, sensitive, and actionable ways to optimize brain health practices across the lifespan.",

    "title": "I built botoease: A unified wrapper to switch between Local Storage and AWS S3 without changing code",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> <code>botoease</code> is a lightweight Python library designed to solve the &quot;environment gap&quot; between development and production. It provides a unified API that handles file uploads, deletions, and URL generation.</p> <p>In development, it saves files to a local folder on your machine. In production, it automatically switches to AWS S3 using the exact same method calls. It removes the need to write verbose <code>boto3</code> boilerplate or complex <code>if/else</code> logic to check which environment your code is running in.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> This library is intended for backend developers (FastAPI, Flask, Django) who are building MVPs or small-to-medium applications. It is currently in the &quot;Beta/Production-Ready for small apps&quot; stage (v0.0.6). It is ideal for developers who want to avoid vendor lock-in or who need to onboard new team members without giving them AWS credentials immediately.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>vs.</strong> <code>boto3</code><strong>:</strong> <code>boto3</code> is the standard SDK but is very low-level and verbose. To upload a file and get a URL, you often need 10+ lines of code involving sessions, clients, and exception handling. <code>botoease</code> wraps this into a single line: <code>storage.upload()</code>.</li> <li><strong>vs.</strong> <code>django-storages</code><strong>:</strong> <code>django-storages</code> is excellent but is tightly coupled to the Django framework. <code>botoease</code> is framework-agnostic and works equally well in FastAPI, Flask, or simple CLI scripts.</li> <li><strong>vs.</strong> <code>smart_open</code><strong>:</strong> <code>smart_open</code> is great for streaming large files but doesn't focus as much on the &quot;developer experience&quot; of generating pre-signed URLs or managing local development folders automatically.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Unified API:</strong> <code>storage.upload()</code> works for both S3 and Local disk.</li> <li><strong>Auto-Directory Management:</strong> Automatically creates local folders if they don't exist.</li> <li><strong>S3 Pre-signed URLs:</strong> Generates secure access links with one command.</li> <li><strong>Zero Boilerplate:</strong> No need to manually configure <code>boto3.client</code>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Example Usage</strong></p> <p>Python</p> <pre><code>from botoease import Storage # 1. Initialize (Switch backend here easily) # For Local: backend=&quot;local&quot; # For S3: backend=&quot;s3&quot;, bucket=&quot;my-bucket&quot; storage = Storage(backend=&quot;local&quot;, folder=&quot;uploads&quot;) # 2. Upload (Code stays the same regardless of backend) file_data = storage.upload(&quot;report.pdf&quot;) print(f&quot;File saved at: {file_data['path']}&quot;) </code></pre> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Source Code (GitHub):</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Bhuvangs04/botoease\">Click to Github</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI:</strong><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/botoease/\">Click to open PyPI</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping-Desk2666\"> /u/Longjumping-Desk2666 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ph7vzw/i_built_botoease_a_unified_wrapper_to_switch/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ph7vzw/i_built_botoease_a_unified_wrapper_to_switch/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
    "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

    "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
    "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

    "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
    "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

    "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
    "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

    "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
    "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

    "title": "KeyNeg: Negative Sentiment Extraction using Sentence Transformers",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A very simple library for extracting negative sentiment, departure intent, and escalation risk from text.</p> <p>---</p> <p>What my project does?</p> <p>Although there are many methods available for sentiment analysis, I wanted to create a simple method that could extract granular negative sentiment using state-of-the-art embedding models. This led me to develop <strong>KeyNeg</strong>, a library that leverages </p> <p>sentence transformers to understand not just that text is negative, but why it's negative and how negative it really is.</p> <p>In this post, I'll walk you through the mechanics behind KeyNeg and show you how it works step by step.</p> <p>---</p> <p>The Problem</p> <p>Traditional sentiment analysis gives you a verdict: positive, negative, or neutral. Maybe a score between -1 and 1. But in many real-world applications, that's not enough:</p> <p>- HR Analytics: When analyzing employee feedback, you need to know if people are frustrated about compensation, management, or workload\u2014and whether they're about to quit</p> <p>- Brand Monitoring: A negative review about shipping delays requires a different response than one about product quality</p> <p>- Customer Support: Detecting escalating frustration helps route tickets before situations explode</p> <p>- Market Research: Understanding why people feel negatively about competitors reveals opportunities</p> <p>What if we could extract this nuance automatically?</p> <p>---</p> <p>The Solution: Semantic Similarity with Sentence Transformers</p> <p>The core idea behind KeyNeg is straightforward:</p> <ol> <li><p>Create embeddings for the input text using sentence transformers</p></li> <li><p>Compare these embeddings against curated lexicons of negative keywords, emotions, and behavioral signals</p></li> <li><p>Use cosine similarity to find the most relevant matches</p></li> <li><p>Aggregate results into actionable categories</p> <p>Let's walk through each component.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 1: Extracting Negative Keywords</p> <p>First, we want to identify which words or phrases are driving negativity in a text. We do this by comparing n-grams from the document against a lexicon of negative terms.</p> <p>from keyneg import extract_keywords</p> <p>text = &quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>Management keeps changing priorities every week. No clear direction,</p> <p>and now they're talking about another restructuring. Morale is at</p> <p>an all-time low.</p> <p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>keywords = extract_keywords(text)</p> <p># [('restructuring', 0.84), ('no clear direction', 0.79), ('morale is at an all-time low', 0.76)]</p> <p>The function extracts candidate phrases, embeds them using all-mpnet-base-v2, and ranks them by semantic similarity to known negative concepts. This captures phrases like &quot;no clear direction&quot; that statistical methods would miss.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 2: Identifying Sentiment Types</p> <p>Not all negativity is the same. Frustration feels different from anxiety, which feels different from disappointment. KeyNeg maps text to specific emotional states:</p> <p>from keyneg import extract_sentiments</p> <p>sentiments = extract_sentiments(text)</p> <p># [('frustration', 0.82), ('uncertainty', 0.71), ('disappointment', 0.63)]</p> <p>This matters because the type of negativity predicts behavior. Frustrated employees vent and stay. Anxious employees start job searching. Disappointed employees disengage quietly.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 3: Categorizing Complaints</p> <p>In organizational contexts, complaints cluster around predictable themes. KeyNeg automatically categorizes negative content:</p> <p>from keyneg import analyze</p> <p>result = analyze(text)</p> <p>print(result['categories'])</p> <p># ['management', 'job_security', 'culture']</p> <p>Categories include:</p> <p>- compensation \u2014 pay, benefits, bonuses</p> <p>- management \u2014 leadership, direction, decisions</p> <p>- workload \u2014 hours, stress, burnout</p> <p>- job_security \u2014 layoffs, restructuring, stability</p> <p>- culture \u2014 values, environment, colleagues</p> <p>- growth \u2014 promotion, development, career path</p> <p>For HR teams, this transforms unstructured feedback into structured data you can track over time and benchmark across departments.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 4: Detecting Departure Intent</p> <p>Here's where KeyNeg gets interesting. Beyond measuring negativity, it detects signals that someone is planning to leave:</p> <p>from keyneg import detect_departure_intent</p> <p>text = &quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>I've had enough. Updated my LinkedIn last night and already</p> <p>have two recruiter calls scheduled. Life's too short for this.</p> <p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>departure = detect_departure_intent(text)</p> <p># {</p> <p># 'detected': True,</p> <p># 'confidence': 0.91,</p> <p># 'signals': ['Updated my LinkedIn', 'recruiter calls scheduled', &quot;I've had enough&quot;]</p> <p># }</p> <p>The model looks for:</p> <p>- Job search language (&quot;updating resume&quot;, &quot;interviewing&quot;, &quot;recruiter&quot;)</p> <p>- Finality expressions (&quot;done with this&quot;, &quot;last straw&quot;, &quot;moving on&quot;)</p> <p>- Timeline indicators (&quot;giving notice&quot;, &quot;two weeks&quot;, &quot;by end of year&quot;)</p> <p>For talent retention, this is gold. Identifying flight risks from survey comments or Slack sentiment\u2014before they hand in their notice\u2014gives you a window to intervene.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 5: Measuring Escalation Risk</p> <p>Some situations are deteriorating. KeyNeg identifies escalation patterns:</p> <p>from keyneg import detect_escalation_risk</p> <p>text = &quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>This is the third time this quarter they've changed our targets.</p> <p>First it was annoying, now it's infuriating. If this happens</p> <p>again, I'm going straight to the VP.</p> <p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>escalation = detect_escalation_risk(text)</p> <p># {</p> <p># 'detected': True,</p> <p># 'risk_level': 'high',</p> <p># 'signals': ['third time this quarter', 'now it's infuriating', 'going straight to the VP']</p> <p># }</p> <p>Risk levels:</p> <p>- low \u2014 isolated complaint, no pattern</p> <p>- medium \u2014 repeated frustration, building tension</p> <p>- high \u2014 ultimatum language, intent to escalate</p> <p>- critical \u2014 threats, legal language, safety concerns</p> <p>For customer success and community management, catching escalation early prevents public blowups, legal issues, and churn.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 6: The Complete Analysis</p> <p>The analyze() function runs everything and returns a comprehensive result:</p> <p>from keyneg import analyze</p> <p>text = &quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>Can't believe they denied my promotion again after promising it</p> <p>last year. Meanwhile, new hires with half my experience are getting</p> <p>senior titles. I'm done being patient\u2014already talking to competitors.</p> <p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>result = analyze(text)</p> <p>{</p></li> </ol> <p>'keywords': [('denied my promotion', 0.87), ('done being patient', 0.81), ...],</p> <p>'sentiments': [('frustration', 0.88), ('resentment', 0.79), ('determination', 0.65)],</p> <p>'top_sentiment': 'frustration',</p> <p>'negativity_score': 0.84,</p> <p>'categories': ['growth', 'compensation', 'management'],</p> <p>'departure_intent': {</p> <p>'detected': True,</p> <p>'confidence': 0.89,</p> <p>'signals': ['talking to competitors', &quot;I'm done being patient&quot;]</p> <p>},</p> <p>'escalation': {</p> <p>'detected': True,</p> <p>'risk_level': 'medium',</p> <p>'signals': ['denied my promotion again', 'after promising it last year']</p> <p>},</p> <p>'intensity': {</p> <p>'level': 4,</p> <p>'label': 'high',</p> <p>'indicators': [&quot;Can't believe&quot;, &quot;I'm done&quot;, 'already talking to competitors']</p> <p>}</p> <p>}</p> <p>One function call.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p><code>fastapi-api-key</code> is library that provides a a backend-agnostic, production-ready and secure API key system, with optional FastAPI and Typer connectors.</p> <p>In my work, I build a lot of FastAPI applications, and each one had its own API key system that was different from the others. The goal of this personal project is to bring together all the requirements of these different APIs into a single library. I thought it would be a good learning experience and useful to try to turn it into an serious open-source library.</p> <ul> <li>Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/Athroniaeth/fastapi-api-key\">https://github.com/Athroniaeth/fastapi-api-key</a></li> <li>Documentation: <a href=\"https://athroniaeth.github.io/fastapi-api-key/\">https://athroniaeth.github.io/fastapi-api-key/</a></li> </ul> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This is for people who have small applications that require simple but scalable access protection for their users or APIs. The library is primarily designed for use with FastAPI but can also be used in other contexts. But it should cover most standard API key use cases.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Most examples, existings library and blog posts about FastAPI API keys use either:</p> <ul> <li>a single key in an environment variable or settings module, or</li> <li>a hardcoded list in memory, wired directly into FastAPI\u2019s <code>APIKey</code>/security utilities.</li> </ul> <p>That works for small demos, but:</p> <ul> <li>there is no real domain model (created_at, expires_at, last_used_at, scopes, is_active\u2026).</li> <li>they usually don\u2019t manage multiple keys properly (create, update, disable, list, delete...) while the application is running.</li> <li>these approaches assume a single process reading a static configuration. As soon as you need to create or disable API keys at runtime, especially with horizontal scaling and multiple workers, they break down.</li> <li>the security aspects are very basic: keys are stored in plaintext, with no hashing using salt and pepper to protect them in case of a leak, and no protection against brute-force attempts.</li> <li>Since Argon2 or Bcrypt hashing is costly, a cache-agnostic system (InMemory / Redis) exists using aiocache, which invalidates itself after a certain amount of time or if the API key is changed (update/delete).</li> </ul> <p><code>fastapi-api-key</code> aims to sit in the middle:</p> <ul> <li>more structured and scalable than \u201cone API key in <code>.env</code> + a dependency\u201d,</li> <li>but lighter and more focused than a full-blown auth server or external API key manager service.</li> </ul> <p>I would like to hear your thoughts on the API design, project architecture, security model, and any specific use cases I might have missed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/__secondary__\"> /u/__secondary__ </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgwr7m/fastapiapikey_a_backendagnostic_productionready/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgwr7m/fastapiapikey_a_backendagnostic_productionready/\">[comments]</a></span>",

No gpg keys, no cloud, just lockenv init, set a password, and lock/unlock the secrets.<p>This tool integrates with OS keyring, so you're not typing passwords constantly.

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

    "title": "Modeling and validation in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with frailty",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The risk of frailty is significantly higher in patients with PD than in age-matched individuals without PD. This study aimed to develop a machine learning\u2013based predictive model for frailty in PD.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study of early- and middle-stage PD patients recruited from June 2024 to June 2025 at Shenzhen People\u2019s Hospital. Frailty was assessed using the Fried criteria (five components: gait speed, grip strength, physical activity, fatigue, and weight loss). A total of 42 demographic and clinical variables, including disease history, Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), and unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS) scores, were collected and compared between PD patients with and without frailty. Spearman correlation and LASSO regression were used to identify independent risk factors. Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to construct predictive models. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the ROC curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration plots, and forest plots.ResultsA total of 205 PD patients were enrolled (133 non-frail, 72 frail; mean age non-frail 62.92\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.69\u202fyears, frail 68.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.44\u202fyears). Significant group differences were found in sex (p\u202f=\u202f0.013), age (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), disease severity (MDS-UPDRS, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; modified Hoehn-Yahr stage (H&amp;Y stage), p\u202f<\u202f0.001), alcohol consumption (p\u202f=\u202f0.010), MoCA (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), HAMD (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), and Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Eight features were identified as independent predictors of frailty: sex, age, alcohol use, Modified H&amp;Y stage, UPDRS-IV score, HAMA score, executive function, and naming. Among all tested algorithms, logistic regression achieved the best predictive performance (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.83 in the test set), outperforming other machine learning models.ConclusionFrailty in PD was associated with female sex, older age, alcohol use, and more advanced disease severity. Patients with PD and frailty exhibited higher MDS-UPDRS scores, more severe cognitive impairment, and greater levels of depression and anxiety. Integrating clinical data with machine learning, especially logistic regression, provides a reliable and scalable tool for early identification and risk stratification of frailty in PD.",

    "title": "Heart rate variability and its modulation by nutrients: a narrative review on implications for cardiovascular aging",
    "content": "Altered intercellular communication is a hallmark of aging, influencing systemic processes across the cardiovascular, neurological, and psychological systems. Among these, cardiovascular aging is particularly important due to its strong association with morbidity and mortality in industrialized societies. Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the natural fluctuations in the time intervals between heartbeats and serves as an indicator of neural interorgan communication, particularly within the cardiac and neural systems, which is fundamentally underpinned by intercellular signaling. HRV captures the autonomic nervous system\u2019s regulation of cardiac function, reflecting the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Beyond its mechanistic significance, HRV provides a window into the organism\u2019s adaptive capacity to stress and the maintenance of homeostasis, encapsulating the interplay between cardiovascular, neural, and endocrine systems. Increasing evidence recognizes HRV as a predictor of survival across diverse populations, from patients with cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological disorders to the general population. Importantly, HRV is modifiable, making it a compelling target for interventions aimed at enhancing healthspan and lifespan. Among these interventions, nutritional strategies hold particular promise. This review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of key dietary factors including omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, and calorie restriction on HRV modulation in human studies. These findings underscore the potential of nutritional approaches to mitigate the deleterious effects of cardiac and neural aging while promoting systemic resilience. HRV transcends its role as a biomarker, serving both as an independent outcome measure and a critical component of algorithmic models for evaluating the efficacy of aging-related interventions. By advancing our understanding of HRV and its modulation through diet, this review bridges fundamental aging biology with applied clinical strategies, highlighting its transformative potential in optimizing both quality of life and longevity.",

    "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological condition that leads to the gradual loss of movement and communicative abilities, significantly diminishing the quality of life for affected individuals. Recent advancements in neuroscience and engineering have propelled the swift evolution of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which are now extensively utilised in medical rehabilitation, military applications, assistive technologies, and various other domains. As a communication medium facilitating direct interaction between the brain and the external world independent of the peripheral nervous system, BCI provides ALS patients with an innovative method for communication and control, offering unparalleled prospects for improving their quality of life. Recent collaborative endeavours among several specialists have markedly enhanced the precision and velocity of diverse BCI paradigms, signifying a breakthrough in BCI applications for ALS. Nonetheless, obstacles and constraints remain. This study methodically extracted pertinent literature from the Web of Science and PubMed databases in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Following stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 studies were identified. This data allows us to summarise the application results and current limitations of several BCI paradigms in motor control and communication, while delineating prospects in multimodal fusion and adaptive calibration. This review presents evidence-based references for the effective translation and application of BCI technology in ALS rehabilitation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05176v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful technology, and thus, we have seen widespread adoption and use on software engineering teams. Most often, LLMs are designed as \"general purpose\" technologies meant to represent the general population. Unfortunately, this often means alignment with predominantly Western Caucasian narratives and misalignment with other cultures and populations that engage in collaborative innovation. In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of \"culturally-informed\" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge. However, given the range of cultural identities present in the United States (U.S.), a national alignment benchmark is an ineffective goal for broader representation. To help fill this gap in this US context, we propose a replication study that translates the process used to develop KorNAT, a Korean National LLM alignment benchmark, to develop CIVIQ, a Cultural Intelligence and Values Inference Quality benchmark centered on alignment with community social values and common knowledge. Our work provides a critical foundation for research and development aimed at cultural alignment of AI technologies in practice.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05536v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Constructing expressive and legible visualizations is a key activity for visualization designers. While numerous design guidelines exist, research on how specific graphical features affect perceived visual complexity remains limited. In this paper, we report on a crowdsourced study to collect human ratings of perceived complexity for diverse visualizations. Using these ratings as ground truth, we then evaluated three methods to estimate this perceived complexity: image analysis metrics, multilinear regression using manually coded visualization features, and automated feature extraction using a large language model (LLM). Image complexity metrics showed no correlation with human-perceived visualization complexity. Manual feature coding produced a reasonable predictive model but required substantial effort. In contrast, a zero-shot LLM (GPT-4o mini) demonstrated strong capabilities in both rating complexity and extracting relevant features. Our findings suggest that visualization complexity is truly in the eye of the beholder, yet can be effectively approximated using zero-shot LLM prompting, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the complexity of visualizations.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05519v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As AI-generated video platforms rapidly advance, ethical challenges such as copyright infringement emerge. This study examines how users make sense of AI-generated videos on OpenAI's Sora by conducting a qualitative content analysis of user comments. Through a thematic analysis, we identified four dynamics that characterize how users negotiate authenticity, authorship, and platform governance on Sora. First, users acted as critical evaluators of realism, assessing micro-details such as lighting, shadows, fluid motion, and physics to judge whether AI-generated scenes could plausibly exist. Second, users increasingly shifted from passive viewers to active creators, expressing curiosity about prompts, techniques, and creative processes. Text prompts were perceived as intellectual property, generating concerns about plagiarism and remixing norms. Third, users reported blurred boundaries between real and synthetic media, worried about misinformation, and even questioned the authenticity of other commenters, suspecting bot-generated engagement. Fourth, users contested platform governance: some perceived moderation as inconsistent or opaque, while others shared tactics for evading prompt censorship through misspellings, alternative phrasing, emojis, or other languages. Despite this, many users also enforced ethical norms by discouraging the misuse of real people's images or disrespectful content. Together, these patterns highlighted how AI-mediated platforms complicate notions of reality, creativity, and rule-making in emerging digital ecosystems. Based on the findings, we discuss governance challenges in Sora and how user negotiations inform future platform governance.",

We conducted a deployment study with 157 eighth-grade students in a South Korean middle school English class over six weeks. Our findings reveal that while scaffolding improved students' ability to compose grammatically correct sentences, this step-by-step approach demotivated lower-proficiency students and increased their system reliance. We also observed challenges to classroom dynamics, where extroverted students often dominated the teacher's attention, and the system's assistance made it difficult for teachers to identify struggling students.

    "title": "Classification and taxonomy of mobile application usability issues",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.05450v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite years of research on testing the usability of mobile applications, our understanding of the issues their users experience still remains fragmented and underexplored. While most earlier studies has provided interesting insights, they have varying limitations in methodology, input diversity, and depth of analysis.On the contrary, this study employs a triangulation strategy, using two research methods (systematic literature review and interview) and two data sources (scholarly literature and expert knowledge) to explore the traits underlying usability issues. Our study contributes to the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) by presenting a catalog of 16 usability issue categories, enriched with corresponding keywords and extended into a taxonomy, as well as a novel three-tier app-user-resource (AUR) classification system. At the first app level, usability issues arise from user interface design, as well as from efficiency, errors, and operability. At the second user level, they influence cognitive load, effectiveness, ease of use, learnability, memorability, and understandability. At the third resource level, usability issues stem from network quality and hardware, such as battery life, CPU speed, physical device button size and availability, RAM capacity, and screen size. The root cause of the usability issues is the user interface design. Detailed findings and takeaways for both researchers and practitioners are also discussed. Further research could focus on developing a measurement model for the identified variables to confirm the direction and strength of their relationships with perceived usability. Software vendors can also benefit by updating existing quality assurance programs, reviews and audits tools, as well as testing checklists.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05438v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an Extended Reality (XR) platform for immersive, interactive visualization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The system extends beyond conventional 2D interfaces by visualizing both structured and unstructured patient data into a shared 3D environment, enabling intuitive exploration and real-time collaboration. The modular infrastructure integrates FHIR-based EHR data with volumetric medical imaging and AI-generated segmentation, ensuring interoperability with modern healthcare systems. The platform's capabilities are demonstrated using synthetic EHR datasets and computed tomography (CT)-derived spine models processed through an AI-powered segmentation pipeline. This work suggests that such integrated XR solutions could form the foundation for next-generation clinical decision-support tools, where advanced data infrastructures are directly accessible in an interactive and spatially rich environment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05433v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Tactile graphics are widely used to present maps and statistical diagrams to blind and low vision (BLV) people, with accessibility guidelines recommending their use for graphics where spatial relationships are important. Their use is expected to grow with the advent of commodity refreshable tactile displays. However, in stark contrast to visual information graphics, we lack a clear understanding of the benefits that well-designed tactile information graphics offer over text descriptions for BLV people. To address this gap, we introduce a framework considering the three components of encoding, perception and cognition to examine the known benefits for visual information graphics and explore their applicability to tactile information graphics. This work establishes a preliminary theoretical foundation for the tactile-first design of information graphics and identifies future research avenues.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05397v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Major life transitions demand high-stakes decisions, yet people often struggle to imagine how their future selves will live with the consequences. To support this limited capacity for mental time travel, we introduce AI-enabled digital twins that have ``lived through'' simulated life scenarios. Rather than predicting optimal outcomes, these simulations extend prospective cognition by making alternative futures vivid enough to support deliberation without assuming which path is best. We evaluate this idea in a randomized controlled study (N=192) using multimodal synthesis - facial age progression, voice cloning, and large language model dialogue - to create personalized avatars representing participants 30 years forward. Young adults 18 to 28 years old described pending binary decisions and were assigned to guided imagination or one of four avatar conditions: single-option, balanced dual-option, or expanded three-option with a system-generated novel alternative. Results showed asymmetric effects: single-sided avatars increased shifts toward the presented option, while balanced presentation produced movement toward both. Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed. Participants rated evaluative reasoning and eudaimonic meaning-making as more important than emotional or visual vividness. Perceived persuasiveness and baseline agency predicted decision change. These findings advance understanding of AI-mediated episodic prospection and raise questions about autonomy in AI-augmented decisions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05389v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While audio guides can offer rich information about an exhibit, it is challenging for visitors to focus on specific exhibit details based only on the verbal description. We present \\textit{CLIO}, a tour guide robot with co-speech actions to direct visitors' visual attention and thus enhance the overall user engagement in a guided tour. \\textit{CLIO} is equipped with designed actions to engage visitors. It builds eye contact with the visitor through tracking a visitor's face and blinking its eyes, or orient their attention by its head movement and laser pointer. We further use a Large Language Model (LLM) to coordinate the designed actions with a given narrative script for exhibition. We conducted a user study to evaluate the \\textit{CLIO} system in a mock-up exhibition of historical photographs. We collected feedback from questionnaires and quantitative data from a mobile eye tracker. Experimental results validated that the engaging actions are well designed and demonstrated its efficacy in guiding visual attention of the visitors. It was evidenced that \\textit{CLIO} achieved an enhanced engagement compared to the baseline system with only audio guidance.",

    "title": "Systematically Evaluating Equivalent Purpose for Digital Maps",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.05310v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Digital geographic maps remain largely inaccessible to blind and low-vision individuals (BLVIs), despite global legislation adopting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). A critical gap exists in defining \"equivalent purpose\" for maps under WCAG Success Criterion 1.1.1, which requires that non-text content provide a text alternative that serves the \"equivalent purpose\". This paper proposes a systematic framework for evaluating map accessibility, called the Map Equivalent-Purpose Framework (MEP Framework), defining purpose through three items (Generalized, Spatial Information, and Spatial Relationships), and establishing 15 measurable criteria for equivalent information communication. Eight text map representations were evaluated against visual map baselines using the proposed MEP Framework. Results show that legacy methods such as tables and turn-by-turn directions fail to meet the MEP Framework criteria, while Audiom Maps, Multi User Domain (MUD) Maps, and Audio Descriptions meet the criteria. The evaluation highlights the necessity of holistic, systematic approaches to ensure non-visual maps convey all generalized spatial information and relationships present in visual maps. The MEP Framework provides a replicable methodology for comprehensively assessing digital map accessibility, clarifying WCAG's \"equivalent purpose\", and guiding compliant and usable map creation. Compliant maps will support BLVIs' participation in map-dependent professions and civic engagement.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05718v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A few million words suffice for children to acquire language. Yet, the brain mechanisms underlying this unique ability remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigate neural activity recorded from over 7,400 electrodes implanted in the brains of 46 children, teenagers, and adults for epilepsy monitoring, as they listened to an audiobook version of \"The Little Prince\". We then train neural encoding and decoding models using representations, derived either from linguistic theory or from large language models, to map the location, dynamics and development of the language hierarchy in the brain. We find that a broad range of linguistic features is robustly represented across the cortex, even in 2-5-year-olds. Crucially, these representations evolve with age: while fast phonetic features are already present in the superior temporal gyrus of the youngest individuals, slower word-level representations only emerge in the associative cortices of older individuals. Remarkably, this neuro-developmental trajectory is spontaneously captured by large language models: with training, these AI models learned representations that can only be identified in the adult human brain. Together, these findings reveal the maturation of language representations in the developing brain and show that modern AI systems provide a promising tool to model the neural bases of language acquisition.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05528v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Art has long played a profound role in shaping human emotion, cognition, and behavior. While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings. This paves the way for applications in education, personalized music technologies, and therapeutic interventions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05500v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: EEG recordings are inherently contaminated by artifacts such as ocular, muscular, and environmental noise, which obscure neural activity and complicate preprocessing. Artifact classification offers advantages in stability and transparency, providing a viable alternative to ICA-based methods that enable flexible use alongside human inspections and across various applications. However, artifact classification is limited by its training data as it requires extensive manual labeling, which cannot fully cover the diversity of real-world EEG. Semi-synthetic data (SSD) methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but prior approaches typically injected single artifact types using ICA components or required separately recorded artifact signals, reducing both the realism of the generated data and the applicability of the method. To overcome these issues, we introduce SSDLabeler, a framework that generates realistic, annotated SSDs by decomposing real EEG with ICA, epoch-level artifact verification using RMS and PSD criteria, and reinjecting multiple artifact types into clean data. When applied to train a multi-label artifact classifier, it improved accuracy on raw EEG across diverse conditions compared to prior SSD and raw EEG training, establishing a scalable foundation for artifact handling that captures the co-occurrence and complexity of real EEG.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05252v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Energy-based models have become a central paradigm for understanding computation and stability in both theoretical neuroscience and machine learning. However, the energetic framework typically relies on symmetry in synaptic or weight matrices - a constraint that excludes biologically realistic systems such as excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) networks. When symmetry is relaxed, the classical notion of a global energy landscape fails, leaving the dynamics of asymmetric neural systems conceptually unanchored. In this work, we extend the energetic framework to asymmetric firing rate networks, revealing an underlying game-theoretic structure for the neural dynamics in which each neuron is an agent that seeks to minimize its own energy. In addition, we exploit rigorous stability principles from network theory to study regulation and balancing of neural activity in E-I networks. We combine the novel game-energetic interpretation and the stability results to revisit standard frameworks in theoretical neuroscience, such as the Wilson-Cowan and lateral inhibition models. These insights allow us to study cortical columns of lateral inhibition microcircuits as contrast enhancer - with the ability to selectively sharpen subtle differences in the environment through hierarchical excitation-inhibition interplay. Our results bridge energetic and game-theoretic views of neural computation, offering a pathway toward the systematic engineering of biologically grounded, dynamically stable neural architectures.",

    "title": "S100A8/A9 Inhibition Reduces Splenic Myelopoiesis and Improves Outcomes After Stroke",
    "content": "Background: Neutrophils are among the earliest immune cells to infiltrate the ischemic brain and contribute to secondary neuronal damage. The alarmin S100 calcium-binding protein A8/A9 (S100A8/A9), predominantly released by neutrophils, is upregulated during this process. Although the bone marrow is recognised as the principal site of neutrophil production via myelopoiesis, the role of the spleen as an immune-responsive organ remains incompletely understood. Methods: In this study, we employed a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in male C57Bl/6 mice and examined immune responses 24 hours post-stroke in the blood, bone marrow and spleen using flow cytometry. To understand the role of S100A8/A9 in modulating stroke-induced myelopoiesis, we administered a small molecule inhibitor of S100A8/A9, ABR-215757, before and after stroke. Results: Neutrophils and S100A8/A9 were found in the infarcted brain tissue. Interestingly, we observed a marked increase in splenic neutrophils, accompanied by an expansion of myeloid progenitors, indicating activation of extramedullary myelopoiesis. Given our previous work showing that S100A8/A9 promotes myelopoiesis, we pharmacologically inhibited S100A8/A9 to determine if this would modulate stroke-induced myelopoiesis. Treatment with ABR-215757 at 24 hours post-stroke led to reduced splenic myelopoiesis, reversed neutrophilia, enhanced forelimb grip strength, and a one-third reduction in infarct size. Conclusion: These findings identify the spleen as a key contributor to neutrophil production following stroke and suggest that targeting S100A8/A9 may attenuate post-stroke inflammation and improve neurological recovery.",

    "title": "Inner-ear delivery of AAV2-retro robustly labels lateral olivocochlear efferents but results in off-target transfection in the contralateral cochlea and the brain",
    "content": "Gene delivery via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) is a valuable tool for understanding the organization and function of auditory neuronal circuitry. In this study, we explored the use of AAVs injected into the inner ear to transfect the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) pathway, a poorly understood ipsilateral component of the auditory efferent feedback system. AAV serotypes exhibit a wide range of properties, including cell type selectivity and the capacity for retrograde transport, but none of the AAV serotypes used for inner ear delivery have been reported to successfully transfect the LOC pathway. Here, we show that unilateral inner ear delivery of AAV2-retro robustly labeled the LOC pathway. However, the ability of AAV2-retro to diffuse via the cochlear aqueduct from the perilymph into the cerebrospinal fluid resulted in off-target transfection in the brain and the labeling of LOC projections in the contralateral cochlea. The extent of contralateral transfection of LOC neurons depended on the age of the animal and the amount of virus delivered to the inner ear. These findings highlight the importance of considering the dosage and properties of AAV serotype when interpreting experimental results.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Code Buddy is an MCP server that gives Claude Desktop real development capabilities. It provides 23+ tools for file operations (read/write/edit anywhere on your system), git integration (status, diff, log, commits), shell command execution, code formatting (Black/Ruff), and project-wide search. Through the MCP protocol, Claude Desktop can now create complete projects end-to-end, debug issues across your codebase, and handle vibe-coding sessions where you describe what you want and it builds it - all directly from Claude's chat interface without leaving the app.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Built for developers who want Claude Desktop to actually modify code, not just suggest changes. If you work across multiple projects and need an AI assistant with file system access, git operations, and command execution, this is for you. Perfect for rapid prototyping, debugging multi-file issues, or building features conversationally. Currently production-ready and in active development - I'm using it daily and adding features as needed.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Unlike specialized MCP servers (filesystem-only, database-only), Code Buddy consolidates development workflows into one server. It supports absolute paths system-wide (not limited to one project), includes git integration that other servers lack, and provides both MCP server and CLI interfaces. While <a href=\"/u/modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\">u/modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem</a> offers basic file access, Code Buddy adds git, shell commands, code formatting, and cross-project editing - enabling full project creation and debugging workflows that isolated tools can't handle.</p> <p>GitHub Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Abhi-vish/code-buddy\">https://github.com/Abhi-vish/code-buddy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vishbhishek\"> /u/vishbhishek </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgmfun/code_buddy_extend_claude_desktop_with_23/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgmfun/code_buddy_extend_claude_desktop_with_23/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It's not any object/blob storage. It's just another PC whose file storage is accessible.</p> <p>Assume something like this -&gt; <code>&quot;\\\\\\\\111.22.3.4\\\\DeltaLakeRootFolder\\\\DeltaId\\\\delta&quot;</code><br /> So, in this folder, I will the delta-lake, the delta folder should contain all parquet chunks, and the _delta_log folder.</p> <p>When I am writing deltalake in the local machine (into the C drive), then it is working properly.<br /> But when I am trying to write it into the network path, then I'm getting this <code>kernel error: Error interacting with object store: Generic LocalFileSystemError: Unable to Convert URL &quot;file:///DeltaLakeRootFolder/DeltaId/delta&quot;</code></p> <p><strong>Try 1:</strong> Did some R&amp;D, and I got to know that mapping the network location into the local machine as a drive can solve this problem. So, I mapped the <a href=\"http://111.22.3.4\"><strong>111.22.3.4</strong></a> network drive as <strong>Z: drive</strong> and then used this <strong>Z drive</strong> path to store deltalake.<br /> Z drive path like this -&gt; <code>&quot;Z:\\\\DeltaLakeRootFolder\\\\DeltaId\\\\delta&quot;</code></p> <p>But I got exactly the same error after doing this.</p> <p><strong>My Queries</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Can someone explain to me why this is happening?</strong></li> <li><strong>Why is the server IP getting converted into a file prefix?</strong></li> <li><strong>And most importantly, what is the solution for storing Deltalake into a network drive like this?</strong></li> </ul> <p>Thanks :)</p> <p>Here's the screenshot of the error.

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

Haven't ever seen a book like this as a Python enthusiast.</p> <p>If you want the perfect Christmas book gift for a Pythonista, this is it.</p> <p>What is your pick as a Christmas gift to a Pythonista?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FortuneCalm4560\"> /u/FortuneCalm4560 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgl3mc/the_perfect_christmas_gift_for_pythonistas_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgl3mc/the_perfect_christmas_gift_for_pythonistas_book/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It is possible to download\nall files in a zip folder that will be called \u2018osfstorage-archive.zip\u2019 when\ndownloaded. But as the OSF supports a nested folder structure, you might miss a\nfolder, and you will quickly end up with \u2018osfstorage-archive (1).zip\u2019, \u2018osfstorage-archive\n(2).zip\u2019, etc. Unzipping these archives creates a lot of files without the\norganized folder structure, in folders with meaningless names, making it\ndifficult to understand where files are. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">The\nosf_file_download function in Papercheck </span></b></h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">We have added\na new function to our R package \u2018<a href=\"https://scienceverse.github.io/papercheck/\">Papercheck</a>\u2019 that will download all files and\nfolders in an OSF repository.

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>When I migrated from a Windows computer to Linux several years ago, after doing DOS scripting before that for many years, I was very surprised no one had written a simple &quot;pause&quot; function that was built-in to Linux. I liked the ability to just type pause and the script would pause at that point. I thought I would write one to offer to those old Windows users like myself that would like to have that &quot;pause&quot; functionality back without hard-coding. </p> <p>I know a lot of people do hard-code their pauses into scripts, especially bash, and it's not a complicated issue to do so, but I thought it would be much nicer to just issue the command &quot;pause&quot; and it would simply pause. Why hard-code when you can just refer to a &quot;pause&quot; command instead?</p> <p>Thinking about the Windows function as I knew it, and in particular what I would have liked it to do, the criteria I chose was that my pause function should have:</p> <ol> <li>A timer capability of counting down the seconds to automatically continue after pausing for a set time.</li> <li>Capture the keystroke and echo the result in order to make it useful for logic selection. </li> <li>Be able to add a custom prompt text in case the default (Press any key to continue...) didn't meet the specific needs of the user. </li> <li>Have the ability to respond with a custom text after the process was allowed to continue. </li> <li>Have the ability to be quiet and do a silent countdown with just a cursor flash for however many seconds. (Must require timer to be set)</li> </ol> <p>So using all this as the criteria I created a simple python script that did each of these things and can also be added to the user's bin folder. </p> <p>The script itself and a .deb file that installs the &quot;pause&quot; script (without .py extension) to /usr/local/bin folder, are available to review: <a href=\"https://github.com/Grawmpy/pause.py\">https://github.com/Grawmpy/pause.py</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
    "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

    "content": "Extensive research has demonstrated that people can intentionally forget by inhibiting the retrieval of unwanted memories, a phenomenon known as suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Although neuroimaging studies have linked retrieval suppression to the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), direct evidence for the causal role this region plays in supporting SIF is still lacking. In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC. Our results will provide novel and critical insights into the brain mechanisms of inhibitory control.",

    "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
    "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

    "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
    "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

    "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

    "title": "Bilateral Field Advantage of Spatial Attention in Macaque Lateral Prefrontal Cortex",
    "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

    "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "title": "mTORC1-Dependent Signaling in Layer 5b Neurons Is Required for Memory Consolidation",
    "content": "Memory consolidation relies on activity-dependent neuronal plasticity, particularly in deep-layer cortical neurons that integrate long-range inputs from medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. In the neocortex, apical tuft dendrites of layer 5b pyramidal neurons receive direct input from the MTL within cortical layer 1, and their activation is critical for associative learning. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable learning-induced plasticity in these neurons remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that activity-dependent, mTORC1-regulated translation in layer 5b neurons contributes to learning and memory. Using in vivo paradigms such as exposure to an enriched environment (EE) and in vitro models of network activation by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP), combined with cell type-specific translational profiling (RiboTag), we identify candidate mRNAs associated with experience-dependent plasticity. We further show that pharmacological inhibition of canonical mTORC1 signaling during memory-relevant tasks abrogated memory consolidation. Our findings identify the mTORC1 pathway as a central regulator of learning-induced protein translation and cortical plasticity.",

    "title": "Serotonin Engages Divergent 5-HT Receptor Pathways for Cell Type-Resolved Modulation of Prefrontal Layer 5 Microcircuits",
    "content": "Background and Purpose: Serotonin (5-HT) is a key neuromodulator in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), yet its cell type-specific effects across excitatory and inhibitory microcircuits remain incompletely understood. We aimed to determine how 5-HT shapes intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission in defined neuronal populations of the medial PFC (mPFC). Experimental Approach: We performed whole-cell recordings from morphologically and electrophysiologically characterised layer 5 (L5) neurons in rat mPFC. Pyramidal neurons were classified into adaptive-spiking high input resistance (ASH), adaptive-spiking low input resistance (ASL), and regular-spiking (RS) types; interneurons were categorised as non-fast-spiking (nFS), regular-fast-spiking (rFS), and stuttering-fast-spiking (sFS) interneurons. These cell types exhibited distinct membrane properties, firing patterns, and axonal projections. We assessed serotonergic modulation using bath-applied 5-HT and subtype-specific receptor mechanisms. Key Results: 5-HT produced divergent postsynaptic responses across pyramidal neuron subtypes: ASH and RS neurons depolarised via 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) activation, whereas ASL neurons exhibited 5-HT1AR-mediated hyperpolarisation. Among interneurons, rFS and sFS cells depolarised through ionotropic 5-HT3ARs, while nFS interneurons were largely unaffected. At the synaptic level, 5-HT suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission between pyramidal neurons via presynaptic 5-HT1BRs, and conversely enhanced GABAergic transmission from FS interneurons via presynaptic 5-HT3ARs. Conclusions & Implications: Serotonin exerts bidirectional, cell type-specific serotonergic modulation of local microcircuits that acts to suppress excitation while facilitating inhibition. This balanced and targeted regulation, arising from distinct distributions of somatodendritic and presynaptic 5-HT receptors, provides a mechanistic basis for serotonergic influence on attention, cognitive flexibility, and emotional regulation.",

    "title": "Cues for odor naming affect performance and brain connectivity",
    "content": "Human olfactory perception and naming represent a complex example of multisensory integration, with growing interest in how cues from different modalities affect olfactory recognition and naming. While studies show that visual cues may support odor naming performance, little is known about how cueing and multisensory integration in odor naming tasks influence neural mechanisms. This study examined the cognitive mechanisms underlying odor identification and the effect of two visual cue types\u2014lexical and color\u2014using behavioral and EEG methods. It also investigated the impact of hedonic ratings, Tip of the Nose phenomenon, familiarity, and subjective recall experiences on odor naming. Forty participants took part in an odor identification task using Sniffin\u2019 Sticks. For each trial, an odorant was first presented, followed by either a visual cue (a color patch associated with the odor source) or a lexical cue (a word fragment). Participants were then asked to name the odor. To examine the neural mechanisms involved in cue-assisted odor identification, the time window during odor naming after the visual cue presentation was analyzed. Connectivity analysis and behavioral performance were assessed to evaluate the effectiveness of the different cue types in supporting identification. Behavioral findings showed that lexical cues improved identification accuracy. Furthermore, hedonic ratings, familiarity, and experiences related to the TON were found to significantly affect naming performance. Odor familiarity and liking levels affected both response accuracy and response time, with more familiar and liked odors being identified both more accurately and more quickly. Granger causality analysis revealed that the color cue condition exhibited more numerous and stronger network connections compared to the lexical cue condition. The lexical cue condition demonstrated more restricted network activation with fewer connections, utilizing focused frontal-temporal and frontal-parietal circuits. In both conditions, prefrontal regions served as strong control hubs, and language networks were preserved. However, additional frontal-occipital connections were observed in the color cue condition, in the form of interhemispheric coordination and visual system integration. The findings demonstrated that cross-modal odor naming utilizes different neural connections depending on cue type, with lexical cues showing more direct access to linguistic areas while color cues exhibit more complex connectivity patterns.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>This is a minimal Python project template I'm using when I spin up small repos. It gives you a ready-to-go structure with src/tests/docs, plus tooling for formatting, linting, testing, type-checking, and dependency management. Out of the box it wires up Black, Ruff, mypy, pytest, pip-tools, pre-commit, and a simple GitHub Actions CI workflow, all driven through invoke tasks so you can run the same commands locally and in CI. </p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This is mainly aimed at people who create a lot of small to medium Python projects and want a clean, modern starting point without a lot of extra complexity. It\u2019s intended for real use (not just a toy), but it deliberately stays lightweight so you can delete or extend pieces as needed. I\u2019ve focused on Python 3.13+ and tried to keep it friendly for Linux/macOS and reasonably compatible with Windows by avoiding make and centralizing commands in tasks.py. </p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Compared to many full-featured templates, this one is intentionally small and opinionated rather than trying to cover every use case. It doesn\u2019t include heavy documentation systems or complex multi-environment setups; instead it focuses on a simple, consistent workflow: invoke for tasks, pip-tools for dependencies, and pyproject.toml for tool configuration. If you want a modern baseline with Black/Ruff/mypy/pytest/pre-commit already integrated, but don\u2019t want to wade through a large scaffold, this might be a useful middle ground.</p> <p>Github Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/sesopenko/python-template\">https://github.com/sesopenko/python-template</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kwirky88\"> /u/kwirky88 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pg10u3/a_small_modern_python_project_template_im_using/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pg10u3/a_small_modern_python_project_template_im_using/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Pairing extinction training with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces drug-seeking by altering activity in afferents to the medial prefrontal cortex",
    "content": "Relapse triggered by drug-associated cues or stress remains a major challenge in treating substance use disorders (SUDs), as re-exposure reliably provokes craving and reinstatement of drug seeking. Extinction-based interventions can reduce cue reactivity, yet extinction learning is often weak or context-dependent, limiting its clinical impact. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) enhances learning-related plasticity via widespread engagement of neuromodulatory systems and cortical circuits. Recent preclinical work shows that pairing extinction with VNS facilitates extinction learning and reduces cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, suggesting translational potential as an adjunct to exposure-based therapies. However, the circuit-level mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. To address this gap, we examined how VNS paired with extinction alters activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) networks that regulate drug seeking, focusing specifically on afferent projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Male rats received retrograde AAV-eGFP infusions into either the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) cortex to label upstream projections, followed by cocaine self-administration, extinction training with VNS or sham stimulation, and cue-induced reinstatement. cFos immunolabeling in the BLA and vHPC revealed pathway-specific modulation: VNS decreased overall BLA activity and reduced activation of BLA to IL projections, but increased activation of BLA to PL projections. In the vHPC, VNS selectively decreased activation of vHPC to IL projections without affecting PL-projecting neurons. Because these pathways synapse onto parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs) in the mPFC, we quantified PVI activation and found that VNS decreased overall prefrontal cFos expression, but increased PVI activity in the PL, and decreased PVI activity in the IL. Together, these results demonstrate that VNS paired with extinction reshapes prefrontal-amygdala-hippocampal circuits in a pathway-specific manner, potentially modulating feed-forward inhibition to reduce relapse-like behavior. These findings support VNS as a promising strategy to strengthen extinction learning and improve treatment outcomes in SUD.",

    "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
    "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

    "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
    "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

    "title": "\u201cPICS\u201d: a novel patient-specific landmark for thalamic surgical interventions in the posterior limb of the internal capsule signal",
    "content": "IntroductionDifficulties in direct visualization of thalamic subnuclei are likely a contributor to inconsistent surgical outcomes among patients with medication refractory tremors. We present a new MRI landmark, represented by a bright signal in the posterior limb of the internal capsule signal (PICS), that can serve as a consistent marker for indirect location of the Vim nucleus of the thalamus. We evaluated the visibility of PICS across multiple MRI sequences at 7Tesla (T) and 3T, and its anatomical characteristics were identified using tractography.MethodsOne healthy control and 15 essential tremor (ET) patients were scanned. To characterize the PICS fibers, two posterior limb of internal capsule (pLIC) tractography schemes were conducted with cortical ROIs as seeds and the pLIC as a waypoint: (i) gross motor cortical ROIs, (ii) M1 and S1 homunculus. Finally, intra- and post-operative clinical data were merged for one ET DBS patient to show correspondence between the parcellation results and clinical observations.ResultsPICS was consistently identified across multiple MRI sequences. Tractography analyses identified PICS to correlate with the distribution of motor fibers from the internal capsule. For the M1 homunculus, two somatotopic clusters were observed: one including mostly trunk, lower and upper limbs; and another, more anteriorly, with head/face clustering with tongue/larynx. For the S1 homunculus, the trunk region was overall the most posterior region followed by the upper limb/face anteriorly and Area2. Intra-operative stimulation at two different depths resulted in pLIC-specific side effect in the tongue/face. At those depths, measurements showed closer proximity of the DBS electrode to M1 clusters of head/face and tongue/larynx, validating the imaging findings.ConclusionPICS appears to be a reliable radiological marker comprising cortico-spinal tracts, in isolation from corticobulbar tracts fibers. It is consistently located lateral to the Vim, making it a potential landmark to infer Vim location and help refine targeting for thalamic procedures. The parcellations of the pLIC using M1 homunculus could potentially inform lead or ablation location based on side effect profiles (e.g., head/face/tongue vs. trunk/limbs). Therefore, proximity or distance to PICS may potentially guide lead placement to avoid procedure-related capsular side effects while optimizing benefits.",

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources.

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I learned python programming recently and built my first python app named TidyBit. It is a simple and easy to use file organizer app. I learned many new things while building the app. </p> <p>What My Project Does:</p> <p>My project is a simple file organizer app, that is useful for anyone who wants to organize cluttered files in folders that are piled up with time. Folders such as Downloads, Desktop, Documents, Videos, Music, folders in an external drive or secondary hard drive..etc. </p> <p>Target Audience: </p> <p>TidyBit is a small python app but not an experimental one or built just for fun. When i started to work on my first app, i wanted to build a small and truly useful app. I wanted to build a simple app with graphical user interface and that can be used by everyone.</p> <p>Comparison: </p> <p>There are many similar python projects on GitHub to organize files. Most of them don't have a graphical user interface. Need knowledge on how to run those programs. TidyBit is easy to use. It works on Windows and Linux platforms. The app is available to download as installable file for windows and portable AppImage format for Linux. For Linux AppImage, it may be necessary to install the correct version of FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to run the app.</p> <p>More information on the app:</p> <p>For initial version, I used python's custom tkinter library for GUI. That didn't look good on Linux ditros. On Windows, the GUI looks modern but it is not the same on Linux. This GUI inconsistency and some more improvements were made to the app. Improvements such as Progress Bar in the UI to display real time progress. Duplicate filename handling, better file organization logic. thread separation for UI and logic so that UI won't crash if the app is used on large sized files. </p> <p>The latest version of the app is TidyBit version 1.2. It is now better, the UI looks good and consistent across Linux and Windows platforms. The operating system theme won't change the look of the UI. </p> <p>Please check the app by visiting the TidyBit app repository as mentioned below. Any feedback on the app or any other suggestions are welcome. Thank you.</p> <p>GitHub repository link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit\">TidyBit GitHub Repo</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/swaroop_34\"> /u/swaroop_34 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pfo7r8/i_developed_my_first_python_app_tidybit_a_simple/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pfo7r8/i_developed_my_first_python_app_tidybit_a_simple/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Frontend is vanilla JS to keep it lightweight.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This is meant for:</p> <ul> <li>Developers building payment integrations who hit Stripe test mode limits</li> <li>Teaching/learning how payment flows work (OTP, webhooks, 3DS simulation)</li> <li>Offline development environments where external APIs aren't accessible</li> <li>Projects that need a mock payment system without external dependencies</li> </ul> <p>Not intended for production use - it's a testing/development tool.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Unlike Stripe's official test mode:</p> <ul> <li>Runs completely offline (no API keys, no internet required)</li> <li>No rate limits or request caps</li> <li>Full control over webhook timing and retry logic</li> <li>Can be customized for specific testing scenarios</li> <li>Works without any external service configuration</li> </ul> <p>Compared to other mock payment tools, this one includes a full UI (not just API endpoints), supports multi-language, has email OTP flow, and comes with Docker Compose for instant setup.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/illusiOxd/acquiremock\">https://github.com/illusiOxd/acquiremock</a></p> <p>Open to feedback, especially on the webhook retry implementation - curious if there's a better approach.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/illusiON_MLG1337\"> /u/illusiON_MLG1337 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pfl8ln/built_an_opensource_mock_payment_gateway_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pfl8ln/built_an_opensource_mock_payment_gateway_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Microglia-astrocyte interaction underlies aquaporin-4 dysregulation in the mouse cortex",
    "content": "Brain water homeostasis relies on the coordinated actions of glial cells. In particular, astrocytes play an essential role in facilitating perivascular water exchange between cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid through aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel highly concentrated at astrocytic endfeet. Dysregulation of AQP4 localization is implicated in various neuropathologies, but its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Although astrocytes and microglia both express {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}-AdRs), whether {beta}-AdR signaling modulates astrocytic AQP4 polarization through microglial activation has not yet been investigated. Here, we hypothesized that microglial activation mediates the {beta}-AdR-induced loss of astrocytic AQP4 polarization. To test this hypothesis, we topically applied the {beta}-AdR agonist, isoproterenol, to the primary visual cortex of anesthetized mice and evaluated AQP4 polarization using double immunohistochemistry. Acute {beta}-AdR activation (3 h) significantly reduced perivascular AQP4 polarization and enhanced local microglial reactivity. Both pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity with minocycline and microglial depletion via dietary administration of the CSF1R antagonist, PLX5622, prevented AQP4 dysregulation induced by isoproterenol. These findings demonstrate that microglial activation is required for {beta}-AdR agonist-induced AQP4 dysregulation in the mouse cortex, revealing a previously unrecognized microglia-astrocyte interaction linking adrenergic signaling to glial water homeostasis.",

    "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Parsers start in a supervised mode where document types are validated by an LLM only when confidence is low (with a carefully monitored audit log\u2014helps balance speed with processing hundreds or thousands of bills for the first run).</p> <p>As a pattern becomes stable within a particular context (e.g., a specific committee), it \u201cgraduates\u201d to autonomous operation.</p> <p>This cuts LLM usage out entirely after patterns are established.</p> <ol> <li>A declarative action-node system</li> </ol> <p>Each event type is defined by:</p> <ul> <li>regex patterns</li> <li>extractor functions</li> <li>normalizers</li> <li>and optional priority weights</li> </ul> <p>Adding a new event type requires registering patterns, not modifying core engine code.</p> <ol> <li>A timeline engine with tenure modeling</li> </ol> <p>The engine reconstructs \u201dtenure windows\u201d (who had custody of a bill when), by modeling event sequences such as referrals, discharges, reports, hearings, and extensions.</p> <p>This allows accurate downstream logic such as:</p> <ul> <li>notice windows</li> <li>action deadlines</li> <li>gap detection</li> <li>duration calculations</li> </ul> <ol> <li>A high-performance decaying URL cache</li> </ol> <p>The HTTP layer uses a memory-bounded hybrid LRU/LFU eviction strategy (`hit_count / time_since_access`) with request deduplication and ETag/Last-Modified validation.</p> <p>This speeds up repeated processing by ~3-5x.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This project is intended for:</p> <ul> <li>developers working with messy, unstructured, real-world text data</li> <li>engineers designing parser pipelines, state machines, or ETL systems</li> <li>researchers experimenting with pattern extraction, timeline reconstruction, or document normalization</li> <li>anyone interested in building declarative, extensible parsing systems</li> <li>civic-tech or open-data engineers (OpenStates-style pipelines)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most existing alternatives (e.g., OpenStates, BillTrack, general-purpose scrapers) extract events for normalization and reporting, but don\u2019t (to my knowledge) evaluate these events against a ruleset. This approach works for tracking bill events as they\u2019re updated, but doesn\u2019t yield enough data to reliably evaluate committee-level deadline compliance (which, to be fair, isn\u2019t their intended purpose anyway).</p> <p>How this project differs:</p> <ol> <li>Timeline-first architecture</li> </ol> <p>Rather than detecting events in isolation, it reconstructs a full chronological sequence and applies logic after timeline creation.</p> <ol> <li>Declarative parser configuration</li> </ol> <p>New event and document types can be added by registering patterns; no engine modification required.</p> <ol> <li>Context-aware inference</li> </ol> <p>Missing committee/dates are inferred from prior context (e.g., latest referral), not left blank.</p> <ol> <li>Confidence-gated parser graduation</li> </ol> <p>Parsers statistically \u201clearn\u201d which contexts they succeed in, and reduce LLM/manual interaction over time.</p> <ol> <li>Formal tenure modeling</li> </ol> <p>Custody analysis allows logic that would be extremely difficult in a traditional scraper.</p> <p>In short, this isn\u2019t a keyword matcher, rather, it\u2019s a state machine for real-world text with an adaptive parsing pipeline built around it and a ruleset engine for calculating and applying deadline evaluations.</p> <p><strong>Code / Docs</strong></p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/arbowl/beacon-hill-compliance-tracker/\">https://github.com/arbowl/beacon-hill-compliance-tracker/</a></p> <p><strong>Looking for Feedback</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d love feedback from Python engineers who have experience with:</p> <ul> <li>parser design</li> <li>messy-data ETL pipelines</li> <li>declarative rule systems</li> <li>timeline/state-machine architectures</li> <li>document normalization and caching</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BeaconHillTracker\"> /u/BeaconHillTracker </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pevr3n/built_a_legislature_tracker_featuring_a_state/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pevr3n/built_a_legislature_tracker_featuring_a_state/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Therapeutic Potential of Flavonoids and Rutin Against Inflammation on a Huntington Animal Model",
    "content": "This study tested the hypothesis that flavonoids (diosmine, hesperidin and rutin(R)) play a protective role in the brain and duodenum against 3-NPA's free radical induced inflammation. This was achieved by measuring the levels of GABA, 5-HIAA, dopamine and some inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Male young Wistar rats (weight 60g) received Salmonella thyphimurium ATCC14028 1x106 CFU/g every week, for two consecutive weeks, plus the following treatments: group A, 9% NaCl 0. (Control); group B, diomine (300mg) + hesperidin (33.3g) + rutin (150mg/kg); group C, 3-NPA; group D, 3-NPA + mix of flavonoids with 1ml of rutin(R) per rat. 3-NPA administration was at 24mg/kgW by intraperitoneal route and the flavonoids were orally administered at every 48 hours for 15 days. At the moment of euthanasia, the blood was obtained to assess Interleukine-6, glucose, triglycerides and hemoglobin levels. Brain and duodenum were obtained to measure GABA, dopamine, 5-HIAA, lipoperoxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), total ATPase concentrations and catalase activity using validated methods. The brains, stomach and duodenum were dissected for histological analysis. In group A, there is a decrease in interleukine-6 levels (p=0.009). In the cortex region of animals in group C, dopamine experienced a significant decrease (p=0.012). GABA increased (p=0.001) in cerebellum regions of animals in the groups A, B and C. ATPase activity increased (p = 0.013) in cerebellum regions in animals of groups C and D. Lipoperoxidation diminished (p=0.043) in cerebellum region of group D. Catalase activity diminished (p=0.043) in Cortex region of animals in groups B and D, and (p=0.002) in cerebellum region of animals in groups A and B. Besides, histological changes revealed marked lesions of neuronal cells in experimental animals treated with nitro propionic acid. The protective role of flavonoids and rutin compounds on inhibition of the inflammatory response and correction of the fundamental oxidant/antioxidant imbalance in animals suffering from Huntington diseases are important vistas for further research.",

    "title": "Functional Connectivity Graph Theory Analysis of Spoken Word Processing Efficiency in Prefrontal Cortical Activation",
    "content": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and graph theory analysis of functional connectivity measures derived from hemodynamic changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can characterize spoken word processing efficiency in neurotypical listeners. Individual differences were assessed by identifying a low performing (Low-P) and a high performing (High-P) individual. Network science and psycholinguistic models of spoken word recognition predict that word frequency and sublexical phonotactic probability of the word form affects the cognitive processing effort. This novel study assesses predictors of processing efficiency directly using functional connectivity measures of global efficiency, local efficiency, modularity, and hubness, derived from listener's frontal lobe hemodynamic response function during a verbal working memory task. Method: A total of 20 neurologically typical participants (ages 18-21) completed an auditory working memory task where participants were required to hold words differing word frequency and sub lexical phonotactic probability in memory. Changes in oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin concentration were recorded with a continuous-wave, multi-channel fNIRS system (TechEn, Inc., Milford, MA) using a 20-channel optode montage across the prefrontal cortex. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between each channel pair to produce 20x20 functional connectivity matrices. Frontal networks were constructed as a graph where nodes in the graph are the light source and edges are connections (e.g., channels) between nodes. Functional connectivity strength and graph theory measures were examined. Results: LF and HF words were not processed differently at the behavioral or brain level. Task performance regardless of word frequency was related to brain measures, with higher strength of prefrontal FC relating of worse accuracy (d-prime) regardless of task block, and with high modularity correlating with slow response times on the LF task, measured by HbR signal. Higher efficiencies tended to correspond to better accuracy but none of the tests were significant. High-P showed low FC strength and high efficiency relative to others, while Low-P had high modularity and low efficiency, in line with the direction of the brain-behavior correlations. Lastly, we characterized the centrally important regions (hubs). These tended to be located in the left inferior area. High-P's hubs overlapped with those showing consistent hubs behavior at the group level, while Low-P's hubs were uncommon. Conclusions: We identified network properties related to efficient and inefficient language processing in typical participants, which can be used to assess language function of atypical populations in future studies.",

    "title": "Astrocytic FKBP5 Regulates Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Outcomes in Excitotoxic Brain Injury",
    "content": "FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51, encoded by FKBP5) is a multisignaling cochaperone that regulates cellular responses to stress. FKBP51 is upregulated in reactive astrocytes; however, the role of FKBP51 in excitotoxic brain injury remains unknown. Here, we investigated how both global and astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 deletion influence seizure susceptibility, astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, and cognition in male mice subjected to a kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy mouse model. Global Fkbp5 knockout (Fkbp5-KO) presented lower seizure activity along with decreased neuronal loss and astrogliosis in the hippocampus compared with the wild-type mice. Astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 conditional knockout (aFkbp5-cKO) mice similarly attenuated seizure severity, decreased astrogliosis, improved novel object recognition, and preserved glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression in hippocampal CA3. Glia-neuron mixed cultures derived from Fkbp5-KO brains showed reduction of NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, astrogliosis, accompanied by decreased NF-{kappa}B p65 phosphorylation. Notably, overexpression of an Fkbp5 quadruple mutant that disrupts the FKBP51-NF-{kappa}B interaction inhibited proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced astrogliosis and NF-{kappa}B activation. The hippocampal transcriptome of the LPS-treated Fkbp5-KO mice revealed suppression of NF-{kappa}B signaling. In summary, this study highlights FKBP51 as a key mediator of excitotoxin-induced neuroinflammation and GLT-1 dysfunction and underlines NF-{kappa}B-mediated inflammatory astrogliosis as a potential intervention target for excitotoxic brain injury.",

    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version.

    "content": "Anesthetics are commonly used to produce unconsciousness, but the neural substrates of unconsciousness remain poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that general anesthesia works by targeting discrete cell types and neural circuits distributed brain-wide, rather than non-specific binding, using a mouse transgenic system. We take advantage of a mouse that expresses chemogenetic designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADDs) in an inducible Cre-dependent manner driven by Fos immediate early gene expression. Since Fos expression peaks with metabolic activity, we use this system to insert synthetic DREADDs into brain-wide neurons that are active under isoflurane anesthesia. We then test the behavioral consequences of chemogenetic stimulation of anesthesia-activated neural ensembles. We observe immobility, discoordination, anti-nociception, and significantly increased anesthetic sensitivity, but not a loss of consciousness as measured by the righting reflex. We next describe brain-wide expression of the captured neurons across the intact mouse brain using iDisco+ whole brain clearing and light sheet microscopy, revealing unique morphological characteristics of sparse, spatially distributed cells. This provides a brain-wide morphologic map with detailed neurite labeling of anesthesia-activated neurons at cellular resolution as a technical resource for the field.",

    "content": "We generated a multi-region, subcellular-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of the human basal ganglia by integrating MERFISH+ and Stereo-seq across four neurotypical donors. These datasets profiled ~7 million cells spanning the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus, resolving 60 transcriptionally distinct cell types. We show region-selective, molecular and spatial diversification of medium-spiny-neuron cell types and multiple non-neuronal populations with distinct molecular identities and spatial localizations. Subcellular RNA localization captures somatic size and projection-inferred signatures that reflect direct and indirect pathway topology. Cellular community analyses reveal the enrichment of sub-clusters of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes at striosome-matrix borders, while primate-expanded interneurons are confined to matrix territories. Cross-species mapping uncovers orthologous striosome-matrix organization and conserved dorsolateral-ventromedial gene expression gradients. This atlas provides a foundational molecular and spatial framework for studying human basal ganglia architecture, offering a multi-centimeter scale resource that links cell types, spatial architecture, and subcellular transcript topography across multiple nuclei.",

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Lemborexant Reduces Infarct Volume and Improves Long-Term Functional Recovery in a Murine Model of Ischemic Stroke",
    "content": "Introduction: Recovery following ischemic stroke is highly variable and often incomplete, underscoring the urgent need to develop novel targeted poststroke treatments. While the mechanisms underlying poststroke recovery remain incompletely understood, sleep fragmentation, a common consequence of stroke, has been linked to worse patient outcomes. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that promotes sleep by suppressing wakefulness and enhancing sleep continuity. We hypothesized that lemborexant would reduce poststroke sleep disturbances and promote recovery in a rodent model of stroke. Methods: We examined the effects of lemborexant (10mg/kg and 30mg/kg) and zolpidem (30 mg/kg) on sleep macrostructure, fragmentation, and EEG spectra in both healthy mice and in stroke model mice, which underwent photothrombotic ischemia of the forelimb somatosensory cortex. We also evaluated whether 12 days of drug administration altered infarct volume and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice. Results: Lemborexant treatment (30mg/kg) increased the percentage of NREM sleep, while preserving sleep continuity, in both healthy and stroke model mice. In contrast, zolpidem increased NREM sleep after stroke, but also increased sleep fragmentation in both groups. Lemborexant treatment at 10mg/kg and 30mg/kg significantly reduced infarct volume eight weeks after the induction of stroke. In addition, lemborexant-treated mice showed greater use of the impaired limb four weeks after stroke. Interpretation: These preclinical findings suggest that lemborexant stabilizes sleep and promotes structural and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice, supporting its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention following ischemic stroke.",

    "title": "Cognitive impairment and progressive neuroinflammation in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA mice expressing the R245H Sgsh variant",
    "content": "Aims: Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA (Sanfilippo syndrome) is an inherited childhood-onset dementia caused by insufficient SGSH enzymatic activity and subsequent accumulation of partially degraded heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. One of the most prevalent mutations is the Arg245His variant, representing up to 58% of mutations in some populations. Whilst other mouse models exist, their applicability to, and translational delivery of, clinically relevant pharmacological chaperones is limited. We therefore aimed to generate and characterise a novel SgshR245H knock-in mouse model of MPS IIIA. Methods: CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing introduced the SgshR245H mutation, and a breeding colony was established. Mouse behaviour was evaluated in a test battery; SGSH activity and heparan sulfate levels were measured using fluorometric and mass spectrometric assays, respectively; and histological staining was undertaken to characterise brain pathology. Results: Spatial memory and learning deficits were apparent in the Morris Water Maze probe and Y-maze tests. Elevated Plus Maze exploration revealed reduced anxiety-like behaviours. SgshR245H mice exhibited progressive accumulation of brain heparan sulfate and elevated levels of GFAP-reactive astroglial staining and activated microglia. Conclusion: SgshR245H MPS IIIA mice recapitulate key characteristics of the human disorder, representing a useful tool for studying disease pathogenesis and evaluating novel therapies.",

    "content": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 (CLN7) is a devastating paediatric neurodegenerative disorder with no cure and limited natural history data to guide therapeutic development. Here, we present the first multimodal characterization of prodromal and early-stage CLN7 disease in Japanese macaques carrying a spontaneous CLN7-/- mutation. Using structural T2-weighted MRI for volumetry, [18F]FDG PET for glucose metabolism, and [11C]PBR28 PET for neuroinflammation, we observed region-dependent patterns in volumetric, molecular, and metabolic alterations. MRI confirmed the presence of disease-associated atrophy in many cortical and subcortical brain regions, consistent with human pathology, [18F]FDG PET revealed early cortical and subcortical widespread hypometabolism, and [11C]PBR28 PET imaging detected progressive neuroinflammation in the same brain areas. CSF analyses further showed age-dependent increases in neurofilament light (NfL), providing convergent evidence for neurodegeneration. Together, these results define a prodromal trajectory in CLN7 disease , establish sensitive imaging and fluid biomarkers, and validate the macaque model as a powerful platform for testing interventions.",

    "title": "Distinct Cortical and Oculomotor Dynamics During Endogenous and Exogenous Competition in Working Memory",
    "content": "Working memory (WM) enables the temporary maintenance of information for guiding thought and action, but its limited capacity requires internal selective attention mechanisms to prioritize goal-relevant representations. Like external attention, internal selection can be shaped by both endogenous (goal-driven) and exogenous (stimulus-driven) factors. Classic work by Charles Folk and Roger Remington demonstrated that such factors interact competitively during external attention, producing stimulus-driven capture under certain conditions. Whether similar competitive dynamics govern internal selection remains unclear. Here, we combined EEG and eye-tracking to examine how endogenous and exogenous influences interact during the selection of information held in working memory. Participants remembered two oriented bars and used either a pro-cue or an anti-cue to guide recall. Behavioral responses and lateralized alpha-band activity revealed robust delays in selecting task-relevant WM content under competition. In contrast, oculomotor biases toward memorized locations emerged with similar timing across pro- and anti-cue conditions, providing no evidence for retro-capture or delayed selection. These findings indicate that internal selection does not resolve competition via rapid capture, as in external attention, but through time-extended cortical processes. Our results highlight functional dissociations between cortical and oculomotor systems and offer new insight into how internal attention implements selection under competitive demands.",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION The locus coeruleus (LC) is among the first sites of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may seed neocortical tau. METHODS We used longitudinal neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to assess LC integrity in vivo in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired older adults with familial risk of AD in relation to tau and amyloid PET and long-term cognitive trajectories. RESULTS We showed that both LC integrity at baseline and its rate of degeneration over time independently predicted a neocortical pattern of tau deposition. In keeping with the known function of the LC, neuropsychological tests showed that LC integrity at baseline predicted changes in attention. Finally, we found that longitudinal LC degeneration correlated with memory decline in people with elevated neocortical amyloid burden. DISCUSSION Our findings underscore the importance of LC in AD pathogenesis. Longitudinal measurement of LC degeneration may help distinguish trajectories of age-related cognitive decline and early AD.",

    "title": "Novel Cln8 p.R24G mouse line replicates major clinical features of Northern epilepsy",
    "content": "Rationale. Northern epilepsy belongs to a group of genetically diverse lysosomal storage diseases, the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). A characteristic feature of NCL pathology is the accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin in the central nervous system. Northern epilepsy is a late-infantile -onset disease. Patients develop normally until 5-10 years old when they first present with general tonic-clonic seizures, followed by progressive cognitive impairment and a decline in motor skills. Northern epilepsy is caused by a missense variant in CLN8, causing a p.R24G amino acid substitution. CLN8 deficiency has been studied traditionally using motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mice, which carry a spontaneous frame shift variant in the murine orthologue Cln8, which is not known to exist in humans. Methods. We have generated the first Cln8 p.R24G mouse model (Cln8R24G) using CRISPR/Cas9. Phenotyping analysis of the mice was conducted using behavioral and histopathological studies focusing on the brain and retina. Results. At birth, Cln8R24G KI mice were viable and asymptomatic. As the mice aged, a progressive accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin containing the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit C was evident in different brain regions and retinal layers. Health monitoring revealed that mutant mice developed progressive but mild motor symptoms around 7 months of age. Spontaneous epileptic seizures, like those observed in Northern epilepsy patients, were detected and recorded. An increase in FosB staining intensity, reflecting neuronal hyperactivity, was observed in hippocampal CA1-CA3 pyramidal and dentate granule cells and correlated well with the intensity of seizure activity. Neuroinflammation was evident at 4 months and increased dramatically with age, mainly in the thalamic VPN/VPL nuclei and moderately in the cortex. Neurodegeneration was most prominent in the VPN/VPL thalamic nuclei. Conclusions. We have generated the Cln8R24G mouse model that genocopies, for the first time, the pathogenic CLN8 variant present in patients with Northern epilepsy. These mice phenocopy major clinical features of the human disease, including mild motor impairment and, unlike the mnd mice, spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures. We hypothesize that our mouse model will open new possibilities for developing and testing targeted treatment options for Northern epilepsy and, more broadly, for early-onset neurodegenerative disorders associated with epilepsy.",

    "title": "Long-lasting structural and functional maturation in transplanted human neurons reprogrammed from glial progenitor cells",
    "content": "Direct reprogramming of brain-resident glial progenitor cells (GPCs) into induced neurons (iN) shows great promise for future regenerative therapies for brain diseases. This type of cell conversion is facilitated by introducing lineage-specific transcription factors or small molecules to somatic cells, and can even be achieve in vivo, targeting resident glia cells in the brain for in vivo conversion. While this have shown promising results in animal models, a crucial step is to show the long-term survival and maturation of human reprogrammed cells in vivo. However, this remains largely unexplored partly due to the inaccessible cell source of GPC and difficulty in transplanting converted neurons. In this study, we assessed human GPCs derived iNs for their long-term structural and functional neuronal maturation after transplantation to the immunodeficient mouse brain. GPCs were transduced with established transcription factor cocktail and transplanted to the medial prefrontal cortex as three-dimensional cultures to improve survival and integration upon transplantation. Our results reveal survival of hiNs, for up to 10 months post-transplantation (MPT) and wide distribution across local and proximal functionally connected brain regions. Morphological analysis revealed a gradual neuronal maturation over time, characterized by increase in cellular complexity and expression of neuronal markers. Supporting these findings, electrophysiological recordings demonstrated progressive functional maturation up to 5 MPT with increase in sodium and potassium currents, and the ability to generate multiple evoked and spontaneous action potentials, validating a neuronal phenotype. Importantly, these changes were absent in control grafts of non-converted hGPCs that retained their glia identity. Our findings indicate that hGPCs derived iNs maintain a stable neuronal phenotype that persist in the mouse brain for extended periods. These cells exhibit survival and remarkable adaptability to the host environment, enabling both structural and functional maturation over time. These results highlight their potential as a promising strategy for neural replacement therapies aimed at restoring damaged circuits and promoting brain repair.",

    "title": "FDTest: Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as a Test for Memory Effects in Brain Dynamics",
    "content": "A central challenge in neuroscience is to understand how the brain flexibly balances local and distributed information processing to support diverse cognitive and conscious states. We hypothesize that a key signature of this balance is the presence of memory effects, which arise when a brain region's future activity depends not only on its current state, but also on past information fed back from the wider network. Here we introduce the FDTest, a method for assessing local memory effects in multidimensional systems by measuring violations of a generalized Fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). We first apply this framework to whole-brain models fitted to human neuroimaging data, showing that the brain's memory structure reflects its underlying connectivity. We then extend the analysis to individualized models of subjects during wakefulness and deep sleep. Memory effects are consistently stronger in wakefulness, indicating richer inter-regional dependencies and more integrated dynamics. These findings establish local memory as a dynamical marker of brain state and position the FDTest as a principled tool for probing the hidden structure of neural dynamics in both models and experiments.",

    "content": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid constituent of the cannabis plant that shows promise for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain region in the etiologies of these disorders and is actively modulated by CBD. Prior research has established that CBD alters the molecular composition of the NAc, but none have assessed how CBD affects NAc neuronal function. In this study, we demonstrate that CBD significantly decreases D1 and D2 medium spiny neuron membrane excitability, broadens action potentials, and has no effect on spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission in the NAc core. These data enhance our understanding of CBDs physiological effects and provide mechanistic insight into its therapeutic potential.",

    "content": "Cranial nerves densely innervate the heart and vasculature, with sensory neurons reporting on blood pressure, respiratory gases, and tissue damage. The roles of arterial baroreceptors in systemic physiology are well appreciated, but the functions of vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors have been more difficult to parse, in part due to the closed-loop structure of the cardiovascular system. Here, we use genetic tools for isolated study of vagal mechanoreceptors in the heart, finding that they are acutely sensitive to circulating blood volume and play key roles in compensating for decreased filling of the heart that occurs in an upright posture and during hemorrhage. Vagal PIEZO2 neurons form characteristic end-net endings in the heart and display blood volume-dependent responses with every heartbeat that are time-locked to atrial and ventricular systole. Vagal PIEZO2 knockout eliminates heartbeat-coupled nerve activity, and compromises carotid blood pressure when mice on a tilt-table are rotated to an upright position. Vagal PIEZO2 knockout mice also display a lethal failure to sustain blood pressure during trauma-induced blood loss. Together, these findings demonstrate an essential function for vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors in sustaining the constancy of blood circulation.",

    "title": "The language network responds robustly to sentences across diverse tasks",
    "content": "A network of left frontal and temporal brain areas supports language comprehension and production, implementing computations related to word retrieval and combinatorial linguistic processing. Here, we ask: are computations over linguistic input driven in a bottom-up way, by the input, or in a top-down way, by task demands? Participants (n=52) read sentences and nonword lists under six task conditions, including passive reading, reading with a memory probe at the end, and tasks that require deep semantic engagement. The sentences>nonwords contrast isolated the same set of language-responsive voxels across all tasks; the locations of those voxels were participant-specific, highlighting the value of individual-specific functional localization. We therefore conclude that language localization is robust to task variation. We then examined responses to each task in these language-responsive voxels (the language network) and in the domain-general multiple demand (MD) network, known to respond to task demands. The language network responded robustly to sentences across all tasks, with somewhat higher responses to semantically engaging tasks. In contrast, the MD network responded to both sentences and nonwords in the presence of a demanding task, which warrants caution when examining brain responses to language tasks accompanied by task demands, as such tasks engage two independent systems. A multivariate analysis revealed that stimulus information is more easily decodable in the language network, whereas task information is more decodable in the MD network. These results suggest that the language and MD networks perform complementary functions during task-driven language comprehension, with the language network primarily extracting information from linguistic input and the MD network determining the appropriate response to the task.",

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) model computational aspects of biology but use homogeneous neurons, limiting realism. A key obstacle to building bio-inspired ANNs is the absence of a database of neuron models that both fit biological data and remain differentiable for gradient-based learning. We present such a database: over 1,000 differentiable single-neuron firing-rate models with accompanying PyTorch code for integration with machine learning. The models belong to the linear-nonlinear (LN) class, which, for ease of reference, we term Generalized Firing Rate (GFR) neurons. Each GFR neuron uses input and firing-rate history filters across multiple timescales, followed by a nonlinearity to generate firing rates. Models are fit to patch-clamp recordings from mouse and human central nervous system slices. Parameter clustering reflects electrophysiological diversity and partially aligns with transgenic lines.

    "title": "Attention modulates hippocampal sharp-wave ripples in humans",
    "content": "Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are high-frequency events critical for memory consolidation, typically studied during sleep and quiet wakefulness. Emerging evidence suggests that SWRs also occur during active behavior, yet their role in awake cognition remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that changes in sustained attention modulate both the occurrence of SWRs and their temporal alignment to ongoing hippocampal oscillations. Using intracranial EEG recordings from epilepsy patients performing a sustained attention to response task (SART), we first identified attentional states based on behavioral variability and subjective reports. Next, we observed that SWRs were more frequent during high-attention periods, despite the absence of memory demands. Importantly, SWRs during low-attention periods showed higher phase synchrony with low-frequency oscillations (theta to lower beta) indicating increased endogenous coordination of SWRs under low attentional focus. These findings show that SWRs are dynamically regulated by attentional engagement, supporting a broader role for ripples in active cognitive processing.",

    "title": "Glucose and Oxygen Metabolism Coordinate Human Cortical Developmental Decisions",
    "content": "Defining metabolic regulation of neurodevelopmental programs is essential to approach developmental disorders and injuries driven by alterations in metabolism. In vitro cultures are the only available method to temporally perturb and study living human brain cells throughout neurogenesis, however most culture systems use supraphysiologic conditions of essential nutrients, glucose and oxygen. We probed how environmental exposure to endogenous-like concentrations impact metabolic state and developmental progression of cortical cell types using organoids. Nutrient accessibility globally impacted metabolic state, yet developmental responses to metabolic changes were cell type-specific. Metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets reveal increased TCA metabolites and amino acids and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, under physiologic glucose conditions. Oxygen level had a modest, yet specific, molecular impact on deep layer excitatory neurons. We assessed consequences of metabolic changes on fate and observed that physiologic glucose expanded the human-enriched population of cortical stem cells, outer radial glia, and their progeny, upper layer excitatory neurons. Alterations in oxygen, instead, affected production of neurogenic progenitors and neuronal differentiation, with higher oxygen availability supporting shifts toward mitochondrial metabolism necessary for maturing cell types. We functionally tested this transition by inhibiting glycolysis; total inhibition promoted neuronal differentiation, whereas inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis/lactate production led to oRG expansion. Lactate signaling was sufficient to suppress oRG development and promote self-renewal of neurogenic progenitors. These data suggest that refined metabolic switches and decreased reliance on glucose are required for transition from stem cell self-renewal to more mature, diversified progenitor subtypes, where switch from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism discretely impacts progenitor diversification.",

    "title": "The 5-HT1A receptor selective agonist NLX-204 displays analgesic activity in the knee osteoarthritis and plantar incisional post-operative pain models in rats",
    "content": "Background: NLX-204 is a highly selective, high efficacy biased agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, which are well-established modulators of pain processing. Objective: To evaluate the analgesic activity of NLX-204 in two rat models of nociceptive/inflammatory pain: the monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and the Brennan's plantar incision model, using morphine as an active comparator, in both male and female rats. Methods: KOA was induced by left intra-articular MIA injection. Analgesic effects of NLX-204 (0.1-3 mg/kg p.o.) or morphine (6 mg/kg s.c.) were assessed on days 5 and 8 by measuring withdrawal threshold (WT) using von Frey filaments and dynamic weight bearing (DWB) on injured and contralateral limbs. In the Brennan's model, the plantar surface of the left hind limb was incised with elevation and incision of the plantaris muscle. Mechanical allodynia (WT) and guarding behavior (GB) were assessed 24 h post-surgery. Results: In the MIA-KOA model, NLX-204 significantly attenuated DWB imbalance in males at 1-3 mg/kg (acute) and 0.1-3 mg/kg (repeated dosing), and in females at 3 mg/kg (repeated dosing only). NLX-204 demonstrated anti-allodynic activity (VF filaments) from 0.3 mg/kg in males (acute and repeated) and from 1 mg/kg in females. In the Brennan's model, NLX-204 reduced GB scores at 1 mg/kg (males) and 0.3-1 mg/kg (females), and showed anti-allodynic effects from 0.3 mg/kg in both sexes. Morphine was effective in both models under acute and repeated administration. Conclusions: Oral NLX-204 demonstrates dose-dependent analgesic and anti-allodynic activity in two rat models of nociceptive/inflammatory pain, supporting the therapeutic potential of selective, high-efficacy 5-HT1A receptor agonists as a novel non-opioid strategy for pain management.",

    "title": "Identification of TREK channels in mouse intracardiac ganglion neurons",
    "content": "The intracardiac nervous system is a complex neural network formed by a diffuse plexus, the so called intracardiac ganglion (ICG). These ganglia locally innervate and control heart function, but little is known about how ICG neuronal activity is regulated. While various ionic currents have been characterized in cardiac tissue, the expression and role of TREK channels in ICG neurons remain unexplored. TWIK-related K+ (TREK) channels, members of the two-pore domain potassium channel family, are essential regulators of neuronal membrane resting potential and excitability, with recognized neuroprotective functions. In this study, we have characterized different ionic currents present in mouse ICG neurons, including tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na currents, delayed K+ rectifiers, Ca+2-dependent K currents and A, H and M currents. Notably, we provide the first evidence of functional TREK channel expression in these neurons. Our findings suggest that TREK channels contribute to excitability control and cellular homeostasis in ICG neurons, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets for cardiac disorders.",

    "title": "Shifts in attentional demand are accompanied by sex-specific patterns of insula-frontal cortical interactions in mice",
    "content": "The insula is a brain region that is correlated with the cognitive process of attention in humans. Aberrant insula function is also implicated in attentional impairments in several psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia. Although the insulas role in attention has been well-studied in humans, we do not yet have an understanding of how the insula communicates with other brain areas to promote attentional processing. Here, we show that neurons in the mouse insula send direct axonal projections to the frontal cortex, and that these two brain areas functionally interact in different ways between male and female mice performing a touchscreen-based attention task. Specifically, we recorded and analyzed local field potentials (LFPs) from the insula and frontal cortex while mice performed variants of a rodent analogue of the continuous performance test of attention, or rCPT. In male mice, we found that activity in the frontal cortex preceded insular activity when the task was well-learned, but that insula-frontal cortex synchrony decreased when the need to inhibit responding was high. In female mice, synchrony between the insula and frontal cortex was largely bidirectional, but was high during all session types. We further demonstrate that patterns of theta-gamma coupling between the frontal cortex and insula distinguish between correct choices and errors during the rCPT, and that these patterns diverge between sexes. Our results suggest that functional differences in insula-frontal cortical circuitry at least partially underlie sex differences in attention-guided behavior in mice.",

    "title": "Precise, individualized foraging flights in honey bees revealed by multicopter drone-based tracking",
    "content": "Honey bees routinely fly hundreds or thousands of meters between their hive and established foraging locations. To navigate these long distances, they are known to combine both landmark use and path integration and have been hypothesized to build a cognitive map. Due to technical challenges inherent in tracking these small insects, obtaining three-dimensional, high-resolution measurements of individual navigational precision, and thus a detailed understanding of their strategies, has been difficult. Here, we utilize a novel multicopter drone-based tracking system to measure the individual flight paths of honey bees in a structured agricultural landscape at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Although bees could choose from multiple routes, we discovered that individual bees follow idiosyncratic paths with striking and repeatable precision. Flight path variability was highest over visually sparse regions and lowest near prominent proximal landmarks. Furthermore, individual strategies differed: some bees flew directly toward the hive before maneuvering around a specific tree, while others flew directly to a gap between a hedgerow and the tree. Thus, each animal varies in how it uses visual information and selects between behavioral strategies. The level of precision exhibited by their flight paths exceeds that reported in the waggle dance, implying that dance variability does not reflect a limit in the bee's underlying spatial representation. Our results demonstrate the remarkable precision of individual bee navigation and illustrate the potential of this new drone-based tracking method to illuminate fine-scale behavioral mechanisms across a spectrum of honey bee ecology and cognition.",

    "title": "Assessment of Motoneuronal Regeneration and Wallerian Degeneration Following Axotomy in Postnatal Mice",
    "content": "Nerve injuries during early postnatal stages results in markedly different outcomes compared to adult injury, with significant motoneuronal death masking potential regenerative capacity. This study systematically evaluated motoneuronal survival, axonal regeneration, and Wallerian degeneration following peripheral nerve injury at distinct postnatal stages (P4, P10, and P30) in mice. Using ChAT-Cre/Ai9(RCL-tdT) and ChAT-Cre/RiboTag transgenic models, we assessed both histological and transcriptomic responses after sciatic nerve lesions. Injury at P4 induced substantial motoneuron death ([~]50%), whilst P10 and P30 animals showed minimal neuronal loss. However, when correcting for neuronal survival, P4 mice demonstrated the highest regenerative capacity, with surviving neurons achieving 100% axonal regeneration. Motoneuron-specific translatome analysis revealed that P30 animals activated a robust regeneration-associated gene (RAG) programme, including classical markers such as Atf3, Gap43, and Ngfr. In contrast, P4 neurons showed minimal RAG upregulation, suggesting they retain an intrinsic growth state that facilitates regeneration without requiring transcriptional reprogramming. P10 animals exhibited a transitional phenotype with impaired RAG activation and reduced regenerative capacity. Wallerian degeneration proceeded efficiently across all developmental stages, with age-specific differences in myelin clearance kinetics and macrophage recruitment. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed consistent downregulation of myelination programmes and upregulation of pro-regenerative markers following injury, regardless of age. These findings indicate that regenerative capacity is primarily determined by the intrinsic growth state of motoneurons rather than extrinsic factors.",

    "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
    "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

    "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
    "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

    "title": "On collective behavior in C. elegans",
    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "content": "Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter for neurodevelopment and brain functioning. Historically, measuring cholinergic effects in living brains required invasive and irradiating procedures, severely limiting our understanding of this system in health and disease. Here, we developed a non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging-based approach to evaluate how cholinergic synapses shape the brain's macroanatomical architecture in exploration (n=1113) and replication cohorts (n=587) of healthy adults. Spatial colocalization of presynaptic acetylcholine transporters emphasized a cholinergic basis of grey matter coupling between basal forebrain and its corticopetal projection targets amygdala, insula and cingulate cortices. Unexpectedly, covarying grey matter regions mimicked the density topographies of M1- muscarinic and 4{beta}2-nicotinic receptors beyond predominant target regions and highlighted effect of the brain's overall cholinergic neuronal populations. The results establish the basis for non-invasive assessments of cholinergic contributions to neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathologies, and pave the way for neuroimaging-guided pharmacological indications of muscarinic antipsychotics, nicotinic anti-addiction and cholinergic anti-dementia drugs.",

    "title": "A novel key player in cognitive striatal processes: the Pthlh interneurons",
    "content": "Interneurons in the dorsal striatum provide essential modulatory control over the projecting neurons, known as medium spiny neurons (MSNs), regulating the output of this brain structure, which is critical for motor control, decision-making, and learning. The diversity of interneurons has been recently determined based on single-cell transcriptomic analyses identifying novel populations as the Pthlh-expressing interneurons, one of the most abundant and distinctive inhibitory populations in the human and mouse striatum. Here, we generated a novel Pthlhcre knock-in mouse line that enables comprehensive study of this critical population. Quantitative histological analyses show that this line effectively targets the Pthlh interneuron class, which appears as a stable population across age, sex and the anterior-posterior axis. To elucidate their functional role, we performed selective chemogenetic inhibition of Pthlh interneurons, which caused significant impairments in striatum-dependent cognitive functions and reduced exploratory behaviorur. Importantly, selective silencing did not affect basal locomotion, motor coordination, or anxiety-like behavior. Monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed that Pthlh interneurons receive dense local input from MSN subtypes and diverse long-range afferents from thalamic and different cortical regions. We further confirm that this population displays electrophysiological heterogeneity encompassing fast-spiking and fast-spiking-like phenotypes. Overall, our findings establish Pthlh interneurons as a major inhibitory class essential for cognitive processing-but not gross motor function-acting as key integrators of local MSN feedback and thalamocortical signals. The novel Pthlhcre mouse line provides a valuable resource for future studies of inhibitory diversity in basal ganglia function and related neurological disorders.",

    "title": "Myelin density dictates region-specific vulnerability of oligodendrocyte lineage cells during aging",
    "content": "Aging of the central nervous system (CNS) leads to a progressive decline in numerous physiological functions. This decline can be attributed in part to alterations within the oligodendrocyte lineage, which comprises myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) and their progenitors, NG2-glia, that play a central role in maintaining homeostasis and ensuring proper myelin turnover. While NG2-glia are distributed throughout the CNS, OLs are enriched in highly myelinated regions, implying spatially heterogeneous requirements for NG2-glia proliferation and differentiation. Consequently, age-related impairments in these progenitor functions may differentially compromise oligodendrogenesis and myelin maintenance across distinct CNS compartments. Yet, the spatial and temporal dynamics of aging-associated alterations within the oligodendrocyte lineage remains insufficiently characterized. To address this gap, we investigated the effects of aging across three age groups in two anatomically adjacent but functionally distinct CNS regions, the cortical gray matter (GM) and the corpus callosum (CC). We demonstrated that aging is accompanied by a marked decline in the NG2-glia population. Aging NG2-glia displayed cell cycle dysregulation, characterized by reduced proliferative and differentiative capacity and accompanied by increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), indicating disrupted homeostatic regulation. These alterations were most pronounced in highly myelinated regions, which also exhibited a stronger shift toward an age-associated inflammatory milieu. In parallel, we observed substantial accumulation of myelin debris and impaired phagocytic clearance in these myelin-dense areas. Moreover, we identified a selective loss of myelinating OLs in the CC, a phenomenon not detected in the gray matter (GM). Together, our findings delineate a tight interdependence between regional myelin density, inflammatory status, and the vulnerability of oligodendrocyte lineage cells to aging. These highlight multiple entry points of potential therapeutic intervention to mitigate CNS aging.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

Identified via activity-dependent gene screening in the rat hippocampus, neuritin promotes neurite outgrowth, dendritic arborization, and synaptic maturation with neural activity. In this review, we summarize recent findings regarding neuritin\u2019s signaling pathways, neuroprotective, neuroregenerative, and neuromodulatory properties, with a focus on its therapeutic potential to counter neurodegeneration in various conditions such as glaucoma, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, stroke, diabetic neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

    "title": "Auditory object segmentation amplifies prediction error signals in a complex MMN paradigm",
    "content": "Auditory deviance detection depends on the segmentation of sound sequences into perceptually meaningful units, which provide the basis for predictive models. Complex mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigms, including dual-rule designs, place higher demands on these processes because regularities are defined by relationships across tones rather than by single features. However, it remains unclear how facilitation of auditory segmentation influences MMN. To address this, we compared MMN elicited during a dual-rule paradigm under continuous versus temporally segmented (750\u202fms gap) conditions in thirty-two participants using simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings. Two 50-ms binaural pure tones were presented in pairs. Tone A was a 1\u202fkHz stimulus biased to the right ear, and Tone B was a 1.2\u202fkHz stimulus biased to the left ear. Within each pair, tones followed with a 330\u202fms Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA), with standards consisting of A-B pairs (85.6%) and deviants of A-A pairs (14.3%). Two conditions were used: a No-Gap condition, where pairs followed continuously with a 330\u202fms SOA, and a Gap condition, where pairs were separated by a longer 750\u202fms SOA. Results at EEG FCz revealed dual-rule MMN amplitudes (130\u2013230\u202fms) were not significantly different between No-Gap and Gap conditions (t(29)\u202f=\u202f0.93; p\u202f=\u202f0.36; d\u202f=\u202f0.17). Conversely, MEG source-localized responses in bilateral primary auditory cortex (A1) revealed larger MMN responses in the Gap condition relative to No-Gap (F(1,31)\u202f=\u202f26.07, p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.457). This suggests that temporal segmentation facilitates the grouping of tone pairs into perceptual objects, allowing the auditory system to form predictions not only at the level of individual tones, but also at the level of the tone pair as a perceptual unit. Deviants in this context violate both low-level features (pitch and location) and the higher-order pair structure, producing larger prediction error signals. These results provide insight into how the auditory system integrates local and higher-order regularities, offering a mechanistic link between auditory scene analysis and hierarchical predictive coding in complex auditory environments.",

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

    "title": "Behavioral tinnitus in gerbils is associated with reduced spontaneous rates in single auditory-nerve fibers",
    "content": "Tinnitus is often initiated by damage to the peripheral auditory system, for example by overexposure to loud sounds. Animal studies have shown that such noise-induced tinnitus is related to increased spontaneous activity in the brainstem dorsal cochlear nucleus as well as further along the central auditory pathway. However, the role of spontaneous activity of the auditory nerve, connecting the peripheral and central auditory systems, in tinnitus and brainstem hyperactivity remains unknown. In the current study, tinnitus was induced by exposing anesthetized Mongolian gerbils to a 115-dB SPL narrowband noise. After one day of recovery, animals were behaviorally tested for gap detection deficits using a gap-prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (GPIAS) paradigm, indicative of tinnitus. Ipsilateral noise-induced threshold shifts did not differ between animals with and without signs of tinnitus. Interestingly, single auditory nerve fibers that were recorded from animals with signs of tinnitus had significantly reduced spontaneous rates compared to both noise-exposed animals without signs of tinnitus and sham-exposed animals. Furthermore, spontaneous rate reduction was specific to fibers with a best frequency within the frequency bands that showed gap detection deficits. On the other hand, inter-spike interval variability and bursting behavior increased in fibers from noise-exposed compared to sham-exposed animals but did not differ with gap detection deficits. These findings suggest that tinnitus-related central hyperactivity may be provoked by reduced spontaneous rates of its innervating auditory nerve fibers. This is consistent with current models explaining the central manifestation of tinnitus, such as the stochastic resonance and central gain models, and allows for a more detailed definition of specifically tinnitus-related deafferentation.",

    "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

    "title": "Triboelectric nanogenerators for neural data interpretation: bridging multi-sensing interfaces with neuromorphic and deep learning paradigms",
    "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

    "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
    "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
    "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
    "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

    "content": "The n-back task has become a central paradigm for investigating the mechanisms of working memory (WM) and related executive functions. This review provides an integrative analysis of the n-back experiment, covering its cognitive operations, task variants, neuroimaging findings, and practical applications across multiple domains. We first delineate three core cognitive components\u2014updating, maintenance, and attentional control\u2014and summarize converging evidence that these functions rely on overlapping fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal networks. We then examine major task variants and review applications in: (1) cognitive training and transfer effects, particularly the proposed association between WM and fluid intelligence; (2) clinical contexts including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and neurological rehabilitation; (3) developmental and educational settings; and (4) emerging research on social cognition, stress, and emotional regulation. Critically, this review evaluates ongoing inconsistencies in how the n-back task is interpreted as a measure of WM and highlights methodological factors, such as task heterogeneity, multi-process interference, and mental fatigue, that complicate both behavioral and neural inferences. To address these issues, we outline methodological recommendations including adaptive task design, multimodal physiological monitoring, and standardized experimental protocols. We further discuss future directions involving virtual reality (VR), mobile platforms, and brain-computer interface (BCI) integration to improve ecological validity and translational relevance. By synthesizing behavioral and neural evidence, this review underscores the n-back task\u2019s versatility while emphasizing the need for improved construct clarity and methodological rigor.",

    "content": "Lexical retrieval is commonly impaired in many persons with aphasia (PWA). Verbal fluency tasks are often used to assess lexical retrieval ability. However, common methods of analyzing verbal fluency data (e.g., total number of appropriate responses, clustering and switching) fail to adequately capture the underlying organization of the mental lexicon. To better understand the nature of lexical-semantic organization in aphasia, this study applied a semantic network approach to verbal fluency data obtained from 120 healthy controls and 127 PWA (64 fluent and 63 nonfluent). Participants named as many animal category members as they could in 1\u202fmin, and their responses were converted into semantic networks. Global network metrics were computed for each group, including average shortest path length, clustering coefficient, and modularity. Compared to the healthy control network, the PWA network was less integrated and more fragmented, reflected by longer average shortest path lengths, reduced clustering, and higher modularity. These disruptions were especially evident in the nonfluent PWA network compared to the fluent PWA network. Complementary spreading activation and percolation analyses demonstrated that PWA networks were both less efficient and less resilient to disruption. Our results demonstrate that network-based analyses of verbal fluency provide a sensitive measure of lexical-semantic organization in aphasia, revealing structural disruptions that are not fully captured by traditional analyses. More broadly, this approach highlights how network science can advance theories of lexical-semantic organization and inform the development of individualized clinical assessments and treatment strategies.",

    "content": "BackgroundHigh-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that offers increased spatial precision compared to conventional tDCS. As its use has expanded across research and clinical settings, there has been increasing interest in understanding its safety and tolerability.ObjectiveThis review summarizes adverse events related to HD-tDCS in both healthy and clinical populations, focusing on how stimulation intensity, session frequency, and polarity influence tolerability.ResultsIn healthy populations, HD-tDCS is most often administered at 1\u20132\u2009mA for 20\u2009min. The most reported adverse events include tingling, itching and burning localized to the site of stimulation, typically described as mild or transient. Studies comparing active and sham stimulation generally report no significant differences in adverse event frequency or intensity, even at higher intensities of 2\u20133\u2009mA. Reports of severe adverse events are rare, and participant dropout due to discomfort is uncommon. Multi-session protocols show similar safety profiles, suggesting that repeated stimulation does not increase adverse effects. In clinical populations HD-tDCS is typically delivered across multiple sessions. Reported adverse events are mild and transient, with few reports of severe outcomes. Polarity-specific comparisons suggest that anodal and cathodal stimulation are similarly tolerated, with no notable differences in adverse event profiles.ConclusionOverall, current evidence indicates that HD-tDCS is a safe and well-tolerated technique across diverse populations and stimulation parameters. Continued use of standardized adverse event reporting will be important to further confirm these findings as clinical application broaden.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study aims to establish the risk factors and predictive model for the occurrence of delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.MethodsData from 155 patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma at the affiliated hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from January 2018 to May 2023 were analyzed. These patients were randomly divided into a training group (108 cases, 70%) and a validation group (47 cases, 30%). Univariate and Multivariate Logistic regression analysis were conducted on the training group to identify risk factors for delayed hyponatremia after surgery. A predictive model was established using R software and validated.ResultsAfter conducting Univariate and Multivariate Logistic regression analysis, factors influencing the occurrence of delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma were identified as follows: elevated preoperative prolactin levels, higher preoperative suprasellar cistern height, and hyponatremia in the first 1\u20132\u202fdays after surgery. The area under the ROC curve for forecasting delayed postoperative hyponatremia (DPH) in training and validation sets was 0.943 and 0.959, respectively. The DCA curve indicated a higher benefit in clinical application.ConclusionThe risk prediction model for delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma, developed in this study, demonstrates favorable predictive performance. The nomogram can be utilized for early identification of high-risk individuals for DPH.",

    "title": "Neurological mechanisms of mental fatigue in cognitive flexibility in soccer players: an event-related potential study based on N2 components",
    "content": "ObjectivesMental fatigue frequently occurs in team sports characterised by high cognitive demands and can adversely affect athletes\u2019 decision-making and executive functions. This study examines the impact of mental fatigue on cognitive flexibility in soccer players, employing event-related potentials (ERP) to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms.MethodEighteen football players from the China University Football Association (CUFA) participated in the study. The research utilised the Stroop task to induce mental fatigue and the More-odd switching task to evaluate cognitive flexibility, with measurement indicators comprising accuracy rate (ACC), reaction time (RT), and N2 component amplitude. The experimental design adhered to a repeated measures protocol, incorporating 2 (time: pre-fatigue/post-fatigue)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (task type: conversion/non-conversion)\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 (electrode positions: Fz, Cz, Pz, F3) factors. Statistical analyses of behavioural data were conducted using non-parametric tests, while ERP data were examined through repeated measures ANOVA.ResultsMental fatigue significantly impaired athletes\u2019 accuracy in the More-odd switching task, evidenced by decreased performance in both conversion and non-conversion conditions (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), alongside prolonged reaction times (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Event-related potential (ERP) analysis demonstrated a marked reduction in the amplitudes of the N2 component post-intervention, with notable differences across electrode sites (F\u202f=\u202f3.192, p\u202f=\u202f0.031). These findings suggest a restriction in cognitive control resources within the frontal and parietal regions.ConclusionThis study illustrates that experimentally induced mental fatigue has a significant detrimental impact on the cognitive performance of football players, leading to slower reaction times and decreased neural electrophysiological indicators (specifically, a reduction in N2 wave amplitude), indicating a decline in conflict monitoring ability. An integrated examination of both behavioural and neurophysiological data indicates that the adverse effects of mental fatigue are likely due to the depletion of general cognitive control resources that rely on the prefrontal cortex, rather than targeting particular cognitive functions. These results offer initial insights into the cognitive and neurological alterations in fatigued athletes. While the study did not explore interventions, the findings lay the groundwork for the development of tailored cognitive training programmes and fatigue management strategies, along with potential evaluation criteria. Notably, the N2 wave amplitude serves as a key metric for assessing cognitive resource levels in football players.",

This endeavor requires accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. However, prevailing approaches for defining brain connectivity often fail to reconcile predefined neurophysiological priors with task-specific functional dynamics. This paper presents the Regional-Synergy Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RS-STGCN), a novel framework designed to bridge this gap. The core innovation is the Regional Synergy Graph Learner (RSGL), which integrates known physiological brain-region priors with a task-driven optimization process. It constructs a sparse, adaptive graph by modeling connectivity at two distinct levels. At the intra-regional level, it establishes core information backbones within functional areas. This ensures efficient and stable local information processing. At the inter-regional level, it adaptively identifies critical, sparse long-range connections. These connections are essential for global emotional integration. This dual-level, dynamically learned graph then serves as the foundation for the spatio-temporal network. This network effectively captures evolving emotional features. The proposed framework demonstrates superior recognition accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results of 88.00% and 85.43% on the public SEED and SEED-IV datasets, respectively, under a strict subject-independent protocol. It also produces a neuroscientifically interpretable map of functional brain connectivity, identifying key frontal-parietal pathways consistent with established attentional networks. This work offers a powerful computational approach to investigate the dynamic network mechanisms underlying human emotion, providing new data-driven insights into functional brain organization.

    "title": "Differentiating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder from other neurodevelopmental disorders: neurocognitive and socio-emotional evidence",
    "content": "BackgroundFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is associated with widespread cognitive, behavioral, and adaptive impairments. Its clinical presentation often overlaps with other neurodevelopmental conditions (ND), such as learning disorders (LD) or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), making differential diagnosis challenging. Although syndrome-specific cognitive patterns have been suggested, a distinctive neurocognitive profile of FASD remains inconclusive.MethodSeventy-six children (46 with FASD and 30 with ND), aged 6\u201315\u202fyears (M\u202f=\u202f11.00, SD\u202f=\u202f2.30), completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, covering domains of intellectual functioning, attention, memory, verbal skills, executive functions, and socio-emotional behavior.ResultsAs compared to normative ranges, children with FASD felt below expected levels in cognitive functioning. Moreover, children with FASD showed significantly lower performance than those with ND across all cognitive domains, including global intelligence, verbal comprehension, working memory, processing speed, attention, memory, and executive functions. At the socio-emotional level, parental reports revealed that children with FASD scored higher than their peers with ND on anxiety, social and thought problems, attentional difficulties, and aggression behavior, although most of them remained within non-clinical ranges.ConclusionFindings support the presence of a distinctive neurocognitive profile in FASD characterized by generalized cognitive deficits and domain-specific impairments (particularly in attention, memory, and executive functions). In addition, children with FASD scored higher on socio-emotional difficulties, although still within non-clinical ranges. These results highlight the clinical relevance of domain-specific assessment and underscore the need for early diagnosis and targeted evidence-based interventions to mitigate long-term cognitive and adaptive challenges associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",

    "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
    "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Responsible LLM Deployment for High-Stake Decisions by Decentralized Technologies and Human-AI Interactions",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.04108v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: High-stakes decision domains are increasingly exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex decision-making tasks. However, LLM deployment in real-world settings presents challenges in data security, evaluation of its capabilities outside controlled environments, and accountability attribution in the event of adversarial decisions. This paper proposes a framework for responsible deployment of LLM-based decision-support systems through active human involvement. It integrates interactive collaboration between human experts and developers through multiple iterations at the pre-deployment stage to assess the uncertain samples and judge the stability of the explanation provided by post-hoc XAI techniques. Local LLM deployment within organizations and decentralized technologies, such as Blockchain and IPFS, are proposed to create immutable records of LLM activities for automated auditing to enhance security and trace back accountability. It was tested on Bert-large-uncased, Mistral, and LLaMA 2 and 3 models to assess the capability to support responsible financial decisions on business lending.",

    "title": "Rethinking AI Evaluation in Education: The TEACH-AI Framework and Benchmark for Generative AI Assistants",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.04107v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform education, most existing AI evaluations rely primarily on technical performance metrics such as accuracy or task efficiency while overlooking human identity, learner agency, contextual learning processes, and ethical considerations. In this paper, we present TEACH-AI (Trustworthy and Effective AI Classroom Heuristics), a domain-independent, pedagogically grounded, and stakeholder-aligned framework with measurable indicators and a practical toolkit for guiding the design, development, and evaluation of generative AI systems in educational contexts. Built on an extensive literature review and synthesis, the ten-component assessment framework and toolkit checklist provide a foundation for scalable, value-aligned AI evaluation in education. TEACH-AI rethinks \"evaluation\" through sociotechnical, educational, theoretical, and applied lenses, engaging designers, developers, researchers, and policymakers across AI and education. Our work invites the community to reconsider what constructs \"effective\" AI in education and to design model evaluation approaches that promote co-creation, inclusivity, and long-term human, social, and educational impact.",

    "title": "LegalWebAgent: Empowering Access to Justice via LLM-Based Web Agents",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.04105v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Access to justice remains a global challenge, with many citizens still finding it difficult to seek help from the justice system when facing legal issues. Although the internet provides abundant legal information and services, navigating complex websites, understanding legal terminology, and filling out procedural forms continue to pose barriers to accessing justice. This paper introduces the LegalWebAgent framework that employs a web agent powered by multimodal large language models to bridge the gap in access to justice for ordinary citizens. The framework combines the natural language understanding capabilities of large language models with multimodal perception, enabling a complete process from user query to concrete action. It operates in three stages: the Ask Module understands user needs through natural language processing; the Browse Module autonomously navigates webpages, interacts with page elements (including forms and calendars), and extracts information from HTML structures and webpage screenshots; the Act Module synthesizes information for users or performs direct actions like form completion and schedule booking. To evaluate its effectiveness, we designed a benchmark test covering 15 real-world tasks, simulating typical legal service processes relevant to Qu\\'ebec civil law users, from problem identification to procedural operations. Evaluation results show LegalWebAgent achieved a peak success rate of 86.7%, with an average of 84.4% across all tested models, demonstrating high autonomy in complex real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.04087v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Effective communication is central to achieving positive healthcare outcomes in mental health contexts, yet international students often face linguistic and cultural barriers that hinder their communication of mental distress. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated images in supporting self-expression of mental distress. To achieve this, twenty Chinese international students studying at UK universities were invited to describe their personal experiences of mental distress. These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores. Findings indicate that prompt design substantially affects perceived helpfulness, with the illustrator persona achieving the highest ratings. This work introduces the first publicly available text-to-image evaluation dataset with human judgment scores in the mental health domain, offering valuable resources for image evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and multi-modal research on mental health communication.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.05067v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Web accessibility guidelines require sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds; yet, manually adjusting colors often necessitates significant visual deviation, compromising vital brand aesthetics. We present a novel, multi-phase optimization approach for automatically generating WCAG-compliant colors while minimizing perceptual change to original design choices.\n  Our method treats this as a constrained, non-linear optimization problem, utilizing the modern perceptually uniform OKLCH color space. Crucially, the optimization is constrained to preserve the original hue ($\\text{H}$) of the color, ensuring that modifications are strictly limited to necessary adjustments in lightness ($\\text{L}$) and chroma ($\\text{C}$). This is achieved through a three-phase sequence: binary search, gradient descent, and progressive constraint relaxation.\n  Evaluation on a dataset of 10,000 procedurally generated color pairs demonstrates that the algorithm successfully resolves accessibility violations in $77.22\\%$ of cases, with $88.51\\%$ of successful corrections exhibiting imperceptible color difference ($\\Delta E_{2000} < 2.0$) as defined by standard perceptibility thresholds. The median perceptual change for successful adjustments is only $0.76\\ \\Delta E_{2000}$, and the algorithm achieves this with a median processing time of $0.876\\text{ms}$ per color pair.\n  The approach demonstrates that accessibility compliance and visual design integrity can be achieved simultaneously through a computationally efficient, perceptually-aware optimization that respects brand identity. The algorithm is publicly implemented in the open-source cm-colors Python library.",

Existing safeguards tend to overlook subtle but clinically significant cues, leaving many risks unaddressed. To better understand the nature of these risks, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 clinicians, researchers, and advocates with expertise in eating disorders. Using abductive qualitative analysis, we developed an expert-guided taxonomy of generative AI risks across seven categories: (1) providing generalized health advice; (2) encouraging disordered behaviors; (3) supporting symptom concealment; (4) creating thinspiration; (5) reinforcing negative self-beliefs; (6) promoting excessive focus on the body; and (7) perpetuating narrow views about eating disorders. Our results demonstrate how certain user interactions with generative AI systems intersect with clinical features of eating disorders in ways that may intensify risk. We discuss implications of our work, including approaches for risk assessment, safeguard design, and participatory evaluation practices with domain experts.",

Spatial presence, the sense of \"being there\", is becoming less of a primary objective and more of a baseline expectation of virtual reality. More than six decades after its invention, VR is shifting from a technical system into a cultural, social, and phenomenological medium, offering experiences that function as distinct modes of reality. Existing theories that focus primarily on perceptual illusions are no longer sufficient to account for these emerging forms of experience. A new framework is needed to guide the design and evaluation of immersive environments by identifying the key technical and abstract dimensions afforded by virtual worlds. These dimensions include spatial, placeness, temporal, social, cultural, cognitive, and psychological parameters. The central argument is that immersive environments must move beyond the technical dimension to leverage richer information channels that shape user experience. This shift from presence to experience orchestration invites creators across disciplines to contribute to the design and assessment of meaningful immersive worlds.",

MHC is also a critical focus in human-centered AI (HCAI) research and application. This chapter systematically examines MHC in AI, articulating its foundational principles and future trajectory. MHC is not simply the right to operate, but the unity of human understanding, intervention, and the traceablity of responsibility in AI decision-making, which requires technological design, AI governance, and humans to play a role together. MHC ensures AI autonomy serves humans without constraining technological progress. The mode of human control needs to match the levels of technology, and human supervision should balance the trust and doubt of AI. For future AI systems, MHC mandates human controllability as a prerequisite, requiring: (1) technical architectures with embedded mechanisms for human control; (2) human-AI interactions optimized for better access to human understanding; and (3) the evolution of AI systems harmonizing intelligence and human controllability. Governance must prioritize HCAI strategies: policies balancing innovation and risk mitigation, human-centered participatory frameworks transcending technical elite dominance, and global promotion of MHC as a universal governance paradigm to safeguard HCAI development. Looking ahead, there is a need to strengthen interdisciplinary research on the controllability of AI systems, enhance ethical and legal awareness among stakeholders, moving beyond simplistic technology design perspectives, focus on the knowledge construction, complexity interpretation, and influencing factors surrounding human control. By fostering MHC, the development of human-controllable AI can be further advanced, delivering HCAI systems.",

ConsentDiff provides that longitudinal view. We build a reproducible pipeline that snapshots sites every month, semantically aligns policy clauses to track clause-level churn, and classifies consent-UI patterns by pulling together DOM signals with cues provided by screenshots. We introduce a novel weighted claim-UI alignment score, connecting common policy claims to observable predicates, and enabling comparisons over time, regions, and verticals. Our measurements suggest continued policy churn, systematic changes to eliminate a higher-friction banner design, and significantly higher alignment where rejecting is visible and lower friction.",

    "content": "arXiv:2508.16667v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The global population is aging rapidly, and aging is a major risk factor for various diseases. It is an important task to predict how each individual's brain will age, as the brain supports many human functions. This capability can greatly facilitate healthcare automation by enabling personalized, proactive intervention and efficient healthcare resource allocation. However, this task is extremely challenging because of the brain's complex 3D anatomy. While there have been successes in natural image generation and brain MRI synthesis, existing methods fall short in generating individualized, anatomically faithful aging brain trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPath, a novel AI model that, given a single structural MRI of an individual, generates synthetic longitudinal MRIs that represent that individual's expected brain anatomy as they age. BrainPath introduces three architectural innovations: an age-aware encoder with biologically grounded supervision, a differential age conditioned decoder for anatomically faithful MRI synthesis, and a swap-learning strategy that implicitly separates stable subject-specific anatomy from aging effects. We further design biologically informed loss functions, including an age calibration loss and an age and structural perceptual loss, to complement the conventional reconstruction loss. This enables the model to capture subtle, temporally meaningful anatomical changes associated with aging. We apply BrainPath to two of the largest public aging datasets and conduct a comprehensive, multifaceted evaluation. Our results demonstrate BrainPath's superior performance in generation accuracy, anatomical fidelity, and cross-dataset generalizability, outperforming competing methods.",

However, this Copernican default assumption is canceled in the case of behaviorally sophisticated entities designed to mimic superficial features associated with consciousness (\"consciousness mimics\"), and in particular a broad class of current, near-future, and hypothetical robots. These considerations, which we formulate, respectively, as the Copernican and Mimicry Arguments, jointly defeat an otherwise potentially attractive parity principle, according to which we should apply the same types of behavioral or cognitive tests to aliens and robots, attributing or denying consciousness similarly to the extent they perform similarly. Our approach is unusual in the following respect: Instead of grounding speculations about alien and robot consciousness in a particular metaphysical or scientific theory about the physical or functional bases of consciousness, we appeal directly to the epistemic principles of Copernican mediocrity and inference to the best explanation.",

Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.",

Although every combinatorial neural code obviously has a realization by some open subsets, determining whether it has a realization by some open convex subsets remains unsolved. Many studies attempted to tackle this decision problem, but only partial results were achieved. In fact, a previous study showed that the decision problem of convex neural codes is NP-hard. Furthermore, the authors of this study conjectured that every convex neural code can be realized as a minor of a neural code arising from a representable oriented matroid, which can lead to an equivalence between convex and polytope convex neural codes. Even though this conjecture has been confirmed in dimension two, its validity in higher dimensions is still unknown. To advance the investigation of this conjecture, we provide a complete characterization of the covering relations within the poset $\\mathbf{P_{Code}}$ of neural codes.",

To probe stimulus-dependent activity, we segmented and concatenated recordings from behavioral experiments into distinct time series corresponding to natural image presentations, blank screens during visual task, and spontaneous activity. While the CV failed to discriminate between these conditions, statistical complexity revealed clear, stimulus-specific motifs in population activity. These results indicate that information-theoretic measures can uncover structured, stimulus-dependent patterns in neural population dynamics that remain unobserved in traditional variability metrics.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.04989v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study investigates the causal neural dynamics by which affordance representations influence action language comprehension. In this study, 18 participants observed stimuli displayed in two conditions during the experiment: text-only (e.g., `Hit with a hammer') and video+text (visual clips with matching phrases). EEG data were recorded from 32 channels and analyzed for event-related potentials and source localization using LORETA, which identified four left-hemisphere regions of interest: the Lateral Occipital Cortex (LOC), Posterior Superior Temporal Gyrus (pSTG), Ventral Premotor Cortex (PMv), and Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL). A space of dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was constructed with driving inputs to LOC and pSTG, and multiple connectivity configurations were tested. Bayesian Model Selection revealed a dominant model in which PMv causally influenced IPL and pSTG, reflecting a feedforward architecture from affordance-related motor regions to semantic hubs. Bayesian Model Averaging further confirmed strong endogenous connections from LOC to PMv and IPL, and significant modulation from PMv to IPL. These findings provide direct evidence that affordance processing in premotor regions drives action language understanding by engaging downstream parietal and temporal areas. The results support grounded cognition theories and offer a mechanistic account of how sensorimotor information contributes to linguistic comprehension.",

    "title": "Setting up for failure: automatic discovery of the neural mechanisms of cognitive errors",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.04808v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Discovering the neural mechanisms underpinning cognition is one of the grand challenges of neuroscience. However, previous approaches for building models of RNN dynamics that explain behaviour required iterative refinement of architectures and/or optimisation objectives, resulting in a piecemeal, and mostly heuristic, human-in-the-loop process. Here, we offer an alternative approach that automates the discovery of viable RNN mechanisms by explicitly training RNNs to reproduce behaviour, including the same characteristic errors and suboptimalities, that humans and animals produce in a cognitive task. Achieving this required two main innovations. First, as the amount of behavioural data that can be collected in experiments is often too limited to train RNNs, we use a non-parametric generative model of behavioural responses to produce surrogate data for training RNNs. Second, to capture all relevant statistical aspects of the data, we developed a novel diffusion model-based approach for training RNNs. To showcase the potential of our approach, we chose a visual working memory task as our test-bed, as behaviour in this task is well known to produce response distributions that are patently multimodal (due to swap errors). The resulting network dynamics correctly qualitative features of macaque neural data. Importantly, these results were not possible to obtain with more traditional approaches, i.e., when only a limited set of behavioural signatures (rather than the full richness of behavioural response distributions) were fitted, or when RNNs were trained for task optimality (instead of reproducing behaviour). Our approach also yields novel predictions about the mechanism of swap errors, which can be readily tested in experiments. These results suggest that fitting RNNs to rich patterns of behaviour provides a powerful way to automatically discover mechanisms of important cognitive functions.",

The received understanding of speech movements as discrete, goal-oriented actions struggles to make contact with the rhythmicity findings. In this work, we demonstrate that an unintuitive -- but no less principled than the conventional -- representation for discrete movements reveals a pervasive limit cycle organization and unlocks the recovery of previously inaccessible rhythmic structure underlying the motor activity of speech. These results help resolve a time-honored tension between the ubiquity of biological rhythmicity and discreteness in speech, the quintessential human higher function, by revealing a rhythmic organization at the most fundamental level of individual articulatory actions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.04087v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective communication is central to achieving positive healthcare outcomes in mental health contexts, yet international students often face linguistic and cultural barriers that hinder their communication of mental distress. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated images in supporting self-expression of mental distress. To achieve this, twenty Chinese international students studying at UK universities were invited to describe their personal experiences of mental distress. These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores. Findings indicate that prompt design substantially affects perceived helpfulness, with the illustrator persona achieving the highest ratings. This work introduces the first publicly available text-to-image evaluation dataset with human judgment scores in the mental health domain, offering valuable resources for image evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and multi-modal research on mental health communication.",

In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

This also affects FOSS because I write such things, so I think about it.</p> <p>I have read many opinions on this matter\u2026 I'd like to understand whether the arguments in favor of the old limit were based on necessity or whether it was just for the sake of theoretical discussion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LazyMiB\"> /u/LazyMiB </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pejhny/is_the_79character_limit_still_in_actual_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pejhny/is_the_79character_limit_still_in_actual_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

Hoping to share the <a href=\"https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-python/blog/2025/12/04/announcing-pact-python-v3/\">release of Pact Python v3</a> that has been a long time coming \ud83d\ude05</p> <hr /> <p>It's been a couple of months since we released Pact Python v3, and after ironing out a couple of early issues, I think it's finally time to reflect on this milestone and its implications. This post is a look back at the journey, some of the challenges, the people, and the future of this project within the Pact ecosystem.</p> <p>Pact is an approach to contract testing that sits neatly between traditional unit tests (which check individual components) and end-to-end tests (which exercise the whole system). With Pact, you can verify that your services communicate correctly, without needing to spin up every dependency. By capturing the expected interactions between consumer and provider, Pact allows you to test each side in isolation and replay those interactions, giving you fast, reliable feedback and confidence that your APIs and microservices will work together in the real world. Pact Python brings this powerful workflow to the Python ecosystem, making it easy to test everything from REST APIs to event-driven systems.</p> <hr /> <p>You can read the rest of the announcement <a href=\"https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-python/blog/2025/12/04/announcing-pact-python-v3/\">here</a> and check out <a href=\"https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-python/\">Pact Python</a>.</p> <p>If you have any questions, let me know \ud83d\ude01</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JP-Ellis\"> /u/JP-Ellis </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pefrdj/announcing_pact_python_v3/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pefrdj/announcing_pact_python_v3/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I recently caught 2 cases, 1 criminal and 1 civil and I realized how incredibly difficult it is for the average person to find a suitable lawyer for their specific situation. There's two ways the average person look for a lawyer, a simple google search based on SEO ( google doesn't know to rank attorneys ) or through connections, which is basically flying blind. Trying to navigate court systems to actually see an attorney\u2019s track record is a nightmare, the portals are clunky, slow, and often require manual searching case-by-case, it's as if it's built by people who DOESN'T want you to use their system.</p> <p>So, I built CourtScrapper to fix this.</p> <p>It\u2019s an open-source Python tool that automates extracting case information from the Dallas County Courts Portal (with plans to expand). It lets you essentially &quot;background check&quot; an attorney's actual case history to see what they\u2019ve handled and how it went.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <ul> <li>Multi-Attorney Search: You can input a list of attorneys and it searches them all concurrently.</li> <li>Deep Filtering: Filters by case type (e.g., Felony), charge keywords (e.g., &quot;Assault&quot;, &quot;Theft&quot;), and date ranges.</li> <li>Captcha Handling: Automatically handles the court\u2019s captchas using 2Captcha (or manual input if you prefer).</li> <li>Data Export: Dumps everything into clean Excel/CSV/JSON files so you can actually analyze the data.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <ul> <li>The average person who is looking for a lawyer that makes sense for their particular situation</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> </p> <ul> <li>Enterprise software that has API connections to state courts e.g. lexus nexus, west law </li> </ul> <p><strong>The Tech Stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Python</li> <li>Playwright (for browser automation/stealth)</li> <li>Pandas (for data formatting)</li> </ul> <p><strong>My personal use case:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Gather a list of attorneys I found through google</li> <li>Adjust the values in the config file to determine the cases to be scraped</li> <li>Program generates the excel sheet with the cases for the listed attorneys</li> <li>I personally go through each case to determine if I should consider it for my particular situation</li> </ol> <p>I\u2019d love for you guys to roast my code or give me some feedback. I\u2019m looking to make this more robust and potentially support more counties.</p> <p>Repo here:<a href=\"https://github.com/Fennzo/CourtScrapper\">https://github.com/Fennzo/CourtScrapper</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlikely90\"> /u/Unlikely90 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1peelsy/i_built_an_automated_court_scraper_because/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1peelsy/i_built_an_automated_court_scraper_because/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Ventromedial striatal dopamine dynamically integrates motivated action and reward proximity",
    "content": "Dopamine release in the ventromedial striatum (VMS) both invigorates actions and encodes reward-related information, yet how these functions are integrated remains under active debate. To investigate this further, we designed four different versions of a rat Go/No-go task, where we systematically manipulated response requirements, temporal task demands, and controllability of reward pursuit. Dopamine release increased reliably during action initiation (Go) but was delayed during action suppression (No-go), and was insensitive to augmented response demands or controllability. Following response completion, dopamine rose gradually until animals arrived at the reward location, irrespective of reward-delivery timing, prior action demands, or controllability. This proximity dopamine-signal was exaggerated after animals exhibited Pavlovian consummatory behavior during No-go trials, revealing a motivational signal component. Together, these findings indicate that in reward contexts, VMS-dopamine signals successively integrate the invigoration of action initiation with the continuous estimation of spatial - but not temporal - proximity to rewards.",

    "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

    "title": "NVUAtlas: A Comprehensive Single-Nucleus RNA-Seq Resource for the Human Neurovascular Unit in Alzheimer's Disease",
    "content": "Background: Neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction is being recognized as one of the earliest contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, systematic investigation of NVU dysfunction is currently limited by lack of access to molecular level information due to underrepresentation of vascular and mural cells in standard single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets. Consequently, existing transcriptomic atlases lack the resolution necessary to capture the coordinated intercellular signaling and dysfunction across vascular components of NVU, including endothelial cells and pericytes. Methods: We constructed the Human NVU Atlas by integrating 11 publicly available snRNA-seq datasets, including vascular-enriched samples, from the human prefrontal cortex. This comprehensive dataset aggregates over 4.2 million nuclei from 748 donors, including AD patients and age-matched controls. We utilized a unified probabilistic pipeline based on deep generative models (SCVI) to perform batch-aware integration and employed an ensemble of supervised and deep-learning classifiers to rigorously re-annotate cell types. Differential expression and ligand-receptor interaction analyses were subsequently performed to identify cell-type-specific disruptions in males versus females. Results: The atlas successfully curated vascular populations from 11 studies to assemble the largest publicly available NVU cohort of endothelial cells (2.8%) and pericytes (1.9%) alongside astrocytes and neurons. Differential expression analysis revealed that while neurons predominantly exhibited gene downregulation in AD, vascular cells displayed a pattern of transcriptional hyperactivity with significant gene upregulation. We also identified pronounced sex-specific vulnerabilities; females exhibited distinct inflammatory signatures and downregulation of basement membrane collagen genes (e.g., COL4A1, COL4A2) in pericytes, whereas these changes were not observed in males. Moreover, cell-cell interaction analysis revealed a widespread loss of collagen-integrin signaling between pericytes and neurons, suggesting the involvement of extracellular matrix disruptions in NVU dysfunction observed in AD. Conclusion: The Human NVU Atlas provides a high-resolution, integrated transcriptomic framework for dissecting the cellular heterogeneity of the neurovascular unit. By uncovering sex-specific vascular mechanisms and disrupted intercellular communication, this resource highlights the critical role of vascular cells in AD progression and serves as a foundational reference for investigating cerebrovascular contribution to AD.",

    "title": "An extended structure of the intracellular domain of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and its proposed interactions with rapsyn",
    "content": "To gain insight into the interactions between rapsyn and the nAChR that induce clustering at the post-synaptic membrane, we refined a cryo-EM dataset using an intracellular domain focused strategy to obtain a 3.0 [A] map with the most extensive density yet for the intracellular domain of the Torpedo nAChR. The improved map allowed us to extend the structure beyond the MX -helix and prior to the MA -helix of the intracellular domain. The new structure defines a sharp N-terminal boundary of each MA -helix to place agrin-dependent phosphorylated tyrosines unambiguously within the flexible regions of the MX-MA loops. Two distinct conformations of the {delta} M4 -helix were also resolved, indicating that M4 conformational heterogeneity reflects intrinsic flexibility rather than a change in gating state. The new structural constraints defined for the MX-MA loop were then used to evaluate AlphaFold3-predicted full-length models of the nAChR, rapsyn, and various rapsyn-nAChR complexes, identifying a consistent, asymmetric 3:1 binding architecture where each rapsyn is always sandwiched between the MX-MA loops from two subunits and where each phospho-tyrosine is lodged in a cationic pocket formed by conserved residues implicated in congenital myasthenic syndromes. The defined architecture fits published cryo-ET maps of Torpedo post-synaptic membranes and explains how both phosphorylated tyrosines and myasthenic syndrome-causing rapsyn mutations modulate receptor clustering.",

    "title": "A paradoxical impact of alcohol on sleep-memory coupling",
    "content": "Sleep serves a fundamental role in memory consolidation, and yet it must adapt to the organism's physiological state. Acute ethanol consumption has a profound impact on animal physiology, but whether intoxication affects the role of sleep in memory consolidation remains unexplored. We demonstrate that acute ethanol exerts a paradoxical dual impact on sleep-memory coupling in Drosophila. Typically, satiated flies require sleep for memory consolidation, but starved flies that must forage for food switch to sleep-independent memory. Ethanol selectively impairs memory consolidation in satiated flies, whereas memories in starved flies remain intact despite intoxication. The observed impairment in satiated flies is due to a switch to sleep-independent memory, which then can't be supported because of ethanol-induced sedation. Mechanistically, the ethanol-induced switch to sleep-independent memory is driven by neuropeptide F-mediated modulation of dopamine signaling. These findings reveal that ethanol intoxication inverts the canonical function of sleep, wherein it becomes detrimental to memory consolidation.",

    "title": "Genetic rescue of disrupted synaptic protein interaction network dynamics following SYNGAP1 reactivation",
    "content": "Synaptic protein interaction networks (PINs) dynamically translate neural activity into biochemical signals that regulate synaptic structure and plasticity. Disruption of these coordinated networks is a common feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes, yet it remains unclear whether the molecular organization of a perturbed network can be restored after development. Here, we examined how post-developmental re-expression of the synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein SynGAP1 affects network structure and signaling dynamics in a conditional SynGAP1 haploinsufficient mouse. Quantitative multiplex co-immunoprecipitation (QMI) across development revealed that SynGAP haploinsufficiency selectively reduced SynGAP-containing complexes without broadly disrupting NMDA-dependent network responses. Tamoxifen-inducible re-expression of SynGAP at postnatal day 21 fully restored both steady-state and activity-dependent interactions within the SynGAP module in hippocampus, and additionally normalized secondary alterations in Shank-Homer scaffolding complexes in somatosensory cortex. These data demonstrate that biochemical restoration of a disrupted synaptic network is achievable, even after early developmental windows have closed. Our findings suggest that while critical periods may constrain functional recovery, molecular network normalization remains possible through genetic reactivation of haploinsufficient synaptic regulators.",

    "title": "Real-life ear-EEG Recordings of Auditory Responses to Ambient Sounds",
    "content": "Despite being one of the most researched neural responses, auditory potentials have primarily been measured in controlled laboratory environments. However, there is a big interest in measuring auditory potentials in more naturalistic environments, with stimuli resembling, to a higher degree, natural sounds. The objective of this study is to investigate auditory evoked potentials elicited by naturally occurring sounds in real-life environments. The paper presents an integration of a portable hearing aid research platform and a portable ear-EEG platform. This setup was validated through recordings of an Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR), elicited by real-time amplitude modulation of the ambient sound at 40Hz. Recordings were conducted in real-life under three conditions: walking and sitting with open and closed eyes. In addition to ear-EEG, scalp EEG was recorded as a reference. For analysis, EEG signals were categorized into three groups: scalp channels, cross-ear channels, and within-ear channels. For each condition and channel group, the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the ASSR was calculated. The ASSR was statistically significant across all channel groups and conditions. A post-hoc analysis assessed the recording duration required to obtain a significant ASSR, revealing that 10 minutes were enough for within ear ear-EEG for all but two cases, whereas less than 7 minutes were sufficient for all but one case when using scalp-EEG.",

    "title": "Asymmetrical modulation of fear expression via GABAB receptors in the mouse medial habenula",
    "content": "The medial habenula (MHb) is implicated in regulating emotional responses to aversive events. Studies in zebrafish have identified a remarkable morphological left-right asymmetry in the dorsal habenula (zebrafish equivalent of mammalian MHb) to interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) pathway and its left-sided-specific role in modulating fear responses. However, there is little evidence for structural or functional lateralization in the mammalian MHb-IPN pathway. Here, we investigated the synaptic properties of left- and right-MHb afferents to the IPN and their roles in the expression of conditioned fear in mice. We found that each IPN neuron receives inputs from both left and right MHb, but the left MHb-originating synapses exhibit lower release probability and higher {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR)-mediated potentiation compared to the right MHb-originating synapses. Interestingly, these asymmetrical properties persist in the inversus visceral mutant mice with normal laterality of the internal organs (situs solitus), but nearly disappear in those with reversed internal organ laterality (situs inversus). Behaviorally, chemogenetic inhibition of cholinergic neurons and conditional deletion of GABABR in the left, but not the right, MHb significantly attenuated cue-dependent fear recall. Our results demonstrate functional asymmetry of the MHb under partial influence of the nodal flow in mice, revealing a predominant role of GABABR-mediated signaling in the left MHb-IPN pathway in modulating fear memories. These findings suggest that lateralized MHb pathways could represent a fundamental principle in the neural regulation of emotion across species, but that they develop differently in zebrafish and mice.",

    "content": "Understanding human navigation in ecological, freely moving conditions requires uncovering how the brain anchors directional representations to the 's orientation. Using high-density mobile electroencephalography and immersive virtual reality during goal-directed whole-body rotations, we found that theta bursts reconstructed in the retrosplenial complex (RSC) encode both acceleration and alignment with the body's principal axes. Crucially, this body-axis-anchored neural signal emerged only during goal-directed rotations, and its strength correlated with individual navigation performance, suggesting an adaptive mechanism which provides a stable egocentric scaffold for orientation. These results provide compelling evidence for a self-motion-gated, body-centered reference frame that supports efficient navigation, and bridge the gap between static neuroimaging findings in humans and rodent research on RSC geometry codes. Overall, our findings advance an embodied, mechanistic account of human navigation, opening new avenues for investigating brain dynamics in naturalistic, movement-rich settings using non-invasive neural recordings.",

So far, achieving this type of combined imaging has been limited by experimental constraints. We assessed the ability of the red-IR emitting VSD ElectroFluor630 (EF-630) to be combined with blue-excitable green-emitting Ca2+ indicators to record signals elicited by electrical stimulation in hippocampal slices. Transversal mouse hippocampal slices were stained with EF-630. Ca2+ indicators, either Fluo-4, Fluo-8, Cal520 or Calbryte520, were loaded using their AM-ester forms. Fluorescence, during stimulation of the CA3 region was imaged at 5 kHz from hippocampal areas of [~]750X250 square microns at 1 micron pixel resolution. After assessing all Ca2+ indicators, we selected Calbryte520 for achieving >30 minutes stable recordings in combination with EF-630. Action potentials and related Ca2+ transients were detected in the CA3 stimulated area whereas synaptic signals were observed in the CA1 region. On these signals, we tested the pharmacological blockade of either action potentials or glutamatergic synaptic potentials. We report novel optical measurements of both electrical and Ca2+ transients in brain slices, providing unique information on neuronal excitability and network activity.",

    "title": "Beyond Inheritance: De novo Fast Motion Computation in Primate Visual Cortex",
    "content": "Objects move through space and time, generating sequential visuotopic activations in all sighted animals leading to motion perception of velocity defined by direction and speed. Humans can effortlessly see motion with speeds ranging from 0.25 to 500deg/s. However, direction-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1)-from which all subsequent processing is presumed to derive-only encode directionality at low speeds. To resolve this paradox, we recorded neuronal responses to moving dots, gratings, and movies across the LGN, V1, MT and MST of the macaque motion pathway. Regardless of cell type and motion stimuli, V1 neurons lost direction selectivity at ~29deg/s while MT and MST neurons maintained it up to ~82deg/s and ~183deg/s, respectively. A cascaded spatiotemporal integration model reveals that at each cortex direction-selective neurons can generate velocity selectivity de novo, by integrating sequential visuotopic activations from preceding areas, irrespective of speed and directionality. By computing velocity anew, the primate brain effectively uses the cortical hierarchy itself to 'shift gears' to efficiently encode slow and fast motion. Thus, five visual areas from the retina into the brain's processing hierarchy, external spatiotemporal information is being computed afresh, offering insights for motion processing in other species, modalities and machine vision.",

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "title": "A deformable attractor manifold organizes human resting-state brain dynamics",
    "content": "Intrinsic brain activity is often described as wandering within a continuous multivariate space, yet the organizing principles that constrain these dynamics remain unclear. Here, we show that spontaneous human brain activity during rest is structured by a deformable attractor manifold. Using large-scale fMRI datasets and a latent dynamical model, we find that cortical activity occupies two reproducible regimes: a low-coherence state with a unimodal latent distribution and a high-coherence state that exhibits bimodality, consistent with transient bistability across association networks. A compact two-parameter energy landscape explains these dynamics, revealing that transitions arise not from switching between discrete states, but from continuous deformation of the manifold that reshapes attractor geometry. Excursions into the bistable regime occur as rapid \"jumps\", whereas returns follow slow drifts along the manifold, reflecting network-specific timescales. Individuals with greater expression of the bistable regime show higher cognitive fluidity, and manifold parameters differentiate mild cognitive impairment from matched controls. These findings identify an organizing geometric and dynamical principle of resting activity, linking large-scale cortical coordination, cognitive variability, and vulnerability to pathology.",

    "title": "DNM2-CMT neuropathy stems from disrupted Schwann cell function and shows limited therapeutic reversibility",
    "content": "Dominant loss-of-function mutations in DNM2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy characterized by sensory and motor deficits associated with myelin and/or axonal abnormalities and muscle atrophy. Increasing DNM2 activity from embryogenesis has been reported to ameliorate neuromuscular phenotypes in the Dnm2K562E/+ CMT mouse; however, this model displays predominantly muscle pathology and limited nerve involvement, precluding rigorous evaluation of neuropathic mechanisms and potential therapies. Here, we performed comprehensive behavioral, electrophysiological, histological and molecular analyses to characterize the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse, which combines systemic heterozygosity for the common K562E mutation together with Schwann cell (SC)-specific deletion of wild-type Dnm2. This model faithfully reproduces key clinical and pathological features of DNM2-CMT, including motor deficits, reduced general force and coordination, and severe sensory and motor conduction deficits associated with axonal loss, demyelination, and inflammation. Mechanistically, we delineate a coherent pathological sequence that explains the profound functional deficits. In particular, a downregulation of the transcription factor EGR2, a master regulator of myelin gene expression, and of the myelin protein MPZ correlates with demyelination. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of DNM2 supplementation, post-symptomatic intrathecal delivery of AAV9-DNM2 driven by the Schwann cell-specific MPZ promoter was performed at 4 weeks. Although DNM2 expression increased in peripheral nerves (~1.9-fold), no significant improvements were observed across behavioural, electrophysiological, structural, or molecular parameters. Together, these findings establish the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse as a robust preclinical model, recapitulating key features of DNM2-CMT, and provides crucial insight into the biological and temporal constraints that must guide future therapeutic strategies for DNM2-CMT.",

    "title": "Astrocyte senescence impairs synaptogenesis due to Thrombospondin-1 loss.",
    "content": "Cellular senescence is an irreversible state linked to aging that involves molecular and functional alterations. The mammalian hippocampus, a key brain region for learning and memory, is highly vulnerable to damage in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, yet the role of cellular senescence in hippocampal aging remains underexplored. Here, we report an early onset of senescence signatures in hippocampal astrocytes of the accelerated aging and frailty mouse model SAMP8. We examine how astrocyte senescence affects excitatory synapse formation, focusing on soluble signals released by astrocytes. Astrocytes isolated from SAMP8 brain and those differentiated from SAMP8 neural stem cells show senescence hallmarks (SA-{beta}-gal, p16INK4a, Lamin B1 loss), alongside a significant reduction in synaptogenic function. While astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from control mice promotes excitatory synaptogenesis through thrombospondin-1 / 2{delta}-1 neuronal receptor signalling, ACM from senescent SAMP8 astrocytes lacks this capacity. Supplementing senescent ACM with thrombospondin-1 protein, or overexpressing thrombospondin-1 gene in senescent astrocytes, reinstates synaptogenesis. At the hippocampal level, thrombospondin-1 and synaptic puncta are reduced in SAMP8 mice. Our findings reveal that senescent astrocytes exhibit reduced synaptogenic capacity due to thrombospondin-1 loss, highlighting their contribution to synaptic dysfunction during aging. Preventing senescence in hippocampal astrocytes may thus restore astrocyte-mediated synaptogenesis in the aged brain.",

    "title": "Selective impairment of spatial recognition memory and reduced frontal corticothalamic spine density following adolescent alcohol consumption",
    "content": "Heavy alcohol use is common during adolescence and is associated with increased risk of alcohol use disorder and prevalence of residual cognitive deficits, especially in behaviors associated with the latently developing prefrontal cortex (PFC). A major need for advancing our understanding of this relationship is replicable and accessible preclinical behavioral batteries that can be used to disassociate the effects of adolescent alcohol on select PFC circuits. Electrophysiological evidence implicates projections from the PFC to mediodorsal thalamus (PFC-MdT) as being uniquely impacted by adolescent intermittent alcohol consumption in mice. The present study aims to evaluate if voluntary consumption of alcohol during adolescence impacts anxiety or PFC-associated spatial and recognition memory and if they are associated with morphological changes to the PFC-MdT circuit. Our results indicate that compared to water-only controls, male and female mice that voluntarily consumed alcohol during adolescence demonstrate performance deficits in the object-in-place recognition task, without affecting the novel object recognition task, Y-maze alternation, anxiety or locomotion, an outcome consistent with PFC and MdT dysfunction. Morphological assessment of PFC neurons from male and female mice following behavioral tasks found a reduction in spine density in basal and apical, but not oblique dendrites of PFC-MdT neurons. Collectively, these results implicate the PFC to MdT circuit integrity as a potential locus of the effects of adolescent alcohol on spatial recognition memory.",

    "title": "Signatures of remote planning in hippocampal replay",
    "content": "During brief, intermittent \"replay\" events, hippocampal activity can express navigational trajectories disconnected from both when and where they originally occurred. While replay biased toward immediate future goals has been observed, there is no evidence yet linking replay to planning beyond the next action. Here, we designed a sequential spatial working memory task which required rats to utilize information across multiple temporally separated actions. Remote replay events matched the animal's future navigational choices made after completing an intervening subtask. Critically, this occurred only when the replayed information was useful for reducing memory load, consistent with it being an active process. Our findings suggest these remote replay events are a neural correlate of episodic forethought, allowing animals to use memories to plan beyond their immediate surroundings.",

    "title": "Rapid robust high-fidelity 3D neuronal extraction from multi-view projections",
    "content": "Recent developments in imaging facilitate large-scale three-dimensional (3D) neuronal recording. While these huge amounts of data shed new light on population-level neural coding, it is much harder to extract neuronal calcium dynamics from 3D volumes than 2D images with the existence of noise and scattering. Here, we presented DeepWonder3D, a general end-to-end pipeline for rapid and robust 3D neuronal extraction with high fidelity. Instead of processing voxel by voxel, DeepWonder3D works on the multi-view projections of 3D imaging data obtained either digitally or optically through specific point spread functions (PSFs) for general applicability to diverse techniques, including point-scanning microscopy, light-field microscopy, and two-photon synthetic aperture microscopy. Integrating denoising, resolution registration, background removal, neuronal extraction, and multi-view fusion into a unified pipeline tailored for large-scale high-resolution datasets contaminated by noise and scattering, DeepWonder3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D localization accuracy with a 10-fold reduction in computational costs, validated by numerical simulations and a hybrid two-photon/light-field imaging system. With the RUSH3D mesoscope, DeepWonder3D achieves rapid high-fidelity 3D calcium extraction of tens of thousands of neurons across the mouse cortex within hours.",

    "title": "Awareness is necessary for predictive learning and prediction-based motor attenuation",
    "content": "Predictive coding theories posit that the brain continuously updates internal models of the world to anticipate sensory input. Attenuation of neural responses to predictable sensory stimuli is thought to aid in this process of prediction error detection and model updating. The topic of whether predictive processes such as sensory attenuation can occur in minimally conscious states has been hotly debated. The current study provides a novel test for the role of awareness in prediction-based attenuation using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) prediction task, whereby predictable stimulation is known to lead to attenuated motor system excitability. The experiment tested whether motor attenuation can occur without awareness using a dual task paradigm to mask a predictive cueing relationship. Participants simultaneously completed an n-back task and a TMS-counting task; critically, a visual cue (in the n-back task) consistently predicted the occurrence of a TMS pulse (in the counting task). Instruction conditions manipulated how much participants were informed of this relationship, and awareness was assessed in a post-experimental questionnaire. The results reveal that motor attenuation was present only in participants instructed about the relationship, or in those who became aware of the cue-TMS association. Implicit, predictable cue-TMS exposure was not sufficient to elicit motor attenuation in unaware participants. These findings show that awareness of the relationship is necessary for predictive learning and prediction-based attenuation in the motor system, challenging the assumption that predictive coding operates automatically.",

    "title": "The RGE-256 toolkit",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have been developing a new random number generator called RGE-256, and I wanted to share the NumPy implementation with the Python community since it has become one of the most useful versions for general testing, statistics, and exploratory work.</p> <p>The project started with a core engine that I published as rge256_core on PyPI. It implements a 256-bit ARX-style generator with a rotation schedule that comes from some geometric research I have been doing. After that foundation was stable, I built two extensions: TorchRGE256 for machine learning workflows and NumPy RGE-256 for pure Python and scientific use. NumPy RGE-256 is where most of the statistical analysis has taken place. Because it avoids GPU overhead and deep learning frameworks, it is easy to generate large batches, run chi-square tests, check autocorrelation, inspect distributions, and experiment with tuning or structural changes. With the resources I have available, I was only able to run Dieharder on 128 MB of output instead of the 6\u20138 GB the suite usually prefers. Even with this limitation, RGE-256 passed about 84 percent of the tests, failed only three, and the rest came back as weak. Weak results usually mean the test suite needs more data before it can confirm a pass, not that the generator is malfunctioning. With full multi-gigabyte testing and additional fine-tuning of the rotation constants, the results should improve further.</p> <p>For people who want to try the algorithm without installing anything, I also built a standalone browser demo. It shows histograms, scatter plots, bit patterns, and real-time statistics as values are generated, and it runs entirely offline in a single HTML file.</p> <p>TorchRGE256 is also available for PyTorch users. The NumPy version is the easiest place to explore how the engine behaves as a mathematical object. It is also the version I would recommend if you want to look at the internals, compare it with other generators, or experiment with parameter tuning.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p>Core Engine (PyPI): pip install rge256_core<br /> NumPy Version: pip install numpyrge256<br /> PyTorch Version: pip install torchrge256<br /> GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/RRG314\">https://github.com/RRG314</a><br /> Browser Demo: <a href=\"https://rrg314.github.io/RGE-256-app/\">https://rrg314.github.io/RGE-256-app/</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/RRG314/RGE-256-app\">https://github.com/RRG314/RGE-256-app</a></p> <p>I would appreciate any feedback, testing, or comparisons.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p><a href=\"https://patx.github.io/micropie\">MicroPie</a> is an ultra micro ASGI framework. It has no dependencies by default and uses method based routing inspired by CherryPy. Here is a quick (and pointless) example:</p> <p>``` from micropie import App</p> <p>class Root(App):</p> <pre><code>def greet(self, name=&quot;world&quot;): return f&quot;Hello {name}!&quot; </code></pre> <p>app = Root() ```</p> <p>That would map to <code>localhost:8000/greet</code> and take the optional param <code>name</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>/greet</code> -&gt; <code>Hello world!</code></li> <li><code>/greet/Stewie</code> -&gt; <code>Hello Stewie!</code></li> <li><code>/greet?name=Brian</code> -&gt; <code>Hello Brian!</code></li> </ul> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>Web developers looking for a simple way to prototype or quickly deploy simple micro services and apps. Students looking to broaden their knowledge of ASGI.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p>MicroPie can be compared to Starlette and other ASGI (and WSGI) frameworks. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/patx/micropie/blob/main/README.md#comparisons\">comparison section in the README</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://github.com/patx/micropie/blob/main/README.md#benchmark-results\">benchmarks section</a>.</p> <h3>Whats new in v0.24?</h3> <p>This release I improved session handling when using the development-only <code>InMemorySessionBackend</code>. Expired sessions now clean up properly, and empty sessions delete stored data. Session saving also moved after <code>after_request</code> middleware that way you can mutate the session with middleware properly. See <a href=\"https://thoughts.harrisonerd.com/post/6930ec8c8f2b97dac838c8d8\">full changelog here</a>.</p> <p>MicroPie is in active beta development. If you encounter or see any issues please <a href=\"https://github.com/patx/micropie/issues\">report them on our GitHub</a>! If you would like to contribute to the project don't be afraid to make a pull request as well!</p> <h3>Install</h3> <p>You can install Micropie with your favorite tool or just use pip. MicroPie can be installed with <code>jinja2</code>, <code>multipart</code>, <code>orjson</code> and <code>uvicorn</code> using <code>micropie[all]</code> or if you just want the minimal version with no dependencies you can use <code>micropie</code>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Miserable_Ear3789\"> /u/Miserable_Ear3789 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pe2fe1/micropie_micro_asgi_framework_v024_released/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pe2fe1/micropie_micro_asgi_framework_v024_released/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) present with complex behavioral symptoms that can arise in the absence of overt structural brain damage. Recent evidence suggests that border-associated macrophages (BAMs) located at the brain\u2019s interfaces regulate central nervous system function, yet the specific roles of distinct BAM subsets remain largely undefined. By reanalyzing single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem PD brains, we identified a BAM subset expressing CD169 that was significantly reduced in patients compared with controls. To examine their function, we employed CD169-DTR mice to selectively ablate CD169+ BAMs and evaluated behavioral and histological changes. Depletion of CD169+ BAMs induced tremors, abnormal hindlimb reflexes, and heightened anxiety-like behavior without dopaminergic neuron loss. Histological analysis revealed a pronounced reduction of mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb, indicating disruption of olfactory-limbic circuitry. These findings demonstrate that CD169+ BAMs are critical for maintaining neural network stability and motor function, and that their loss can elicit PD-like phenotypes in the absence of classical dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This work establishes a novel mouse model linking brain-border immune cell dysfunction to Parkinsonian pathology and highlights a neuroimmune mechanism that may contribute to the onset of PD-like disorders.",

    "title": "GABA co-release guides the functional maturation of glycinergicsynapses in an auditory sound localization circuit.",
    "content": "In the mammalian brainstem and spinal cord, glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, during development, many glycinergic neurons also co-release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the acute effects of GABA co-release on immature synaptic transmission have been increasingly characterized, its role in synapse maturation and circuit formation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the developmental roles of GABA co-release at glycinergic synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO), an auditory pathway essential for binaural integration and sound localization. During the first two postnatal weeks, MNTB-LSO synapses co-release GABA and undergo pronounced synaptic and circuit refinement. Using conditional knockout mice with severely diminished GABA co-release from MNTB neurons, we found that key aspects of circuit refinement, including synaptic silencing and strengthening, occurred normally. However, a disruption of GABA co-release resulted in significantly larger quantal amplitudes and a reduced readily releasable vesicle pool, impairing the high fidelity and temporal precision of synaptic transmission, which are essential for accurate binaural processing. These results reveal a critical developmental role for GABA co-release in shaping the functional synaptic architecture of glycinergic synapses involved in sound localization.",

    "title": "Top-down control of sustained attention by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)- locus coeruleus (LC) circuit during the rodent continuous performance task (rCPT)",
    "content": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a pivotal role in attention by exerting top-down control to allocate cognitive resources toward behaviorally relevant stimuli based on learned context and expectations. mPFC neurons project to multiple cortical and subcortical regions, including the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's primary source of norepinephrine (NE). The mPFC also receives inputs from the LC, which release NE to modulate mPFC neuronal activity and downstream cellular signaling. While enhanced functional connectivity between the mPFC and LC in mice during sustained attention tasks suggest an important role for the mPFC-LC circuit, functional evidence directly implicating this circuit in attention is lacking. Here, we investigated the role of the mPFC-LC circuit in attention by comparing selective chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons that project to the LC (mPFC-LC projectors) to non-specific chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons. Selective activation of mPFC-LC projectors in mice performing the rodent continuous performance test (rCPT), a translational sustained attention task, robustly improves attentional performance by enhancing discrimination while non-selective activation of mPFC neurons increases attentional performance by increasing responsiveness and impulsivity. Behavioral effects of mPFC-LC projector activation were mediated by recruitment of a microcircuit involving LC-NE neurons and glutamate and GABA peri-LC neurons. while effects of non-selective activation of mPFC neurons were mediated by engaging downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as the LC/peri-LC region.",

    "content": "The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) integrates visual information with task demands to guide saccadic eye movements. Most prior studies have relied on imposed prolonged delays to separate sensory and motor activity, whereas natural behavior involves rapid sensory-motor transformations. To examine LIP function during more naturalistic oculomotor behavior, we recorded multi-unit activity from LIP in two marmosets performing a task requiring rapid selection of salient visual stimuli. Because sensory and motor signals temporally overlap in such fast tasks, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that separately captured visually driven and oculomotor-related components. The model explained substantial neural variance during correct and missed saccades, as well as spontaneous eye movements, and revealed heterogeneous sensory and motor encoding across recorded neural units. Our approach demonstrated that the origins of neural activity can be segregated without relying on imposed delays, and showed the presence of a strong post-saccadic motor signal in LIP.",

    "content": "Purpose: High-resolution 7T diffusion MRI (dMRI) is limited by image artifacts that compromise anatomical accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate phase-encoding (PE) acquisition and correction strategies to determine which methods best mitigate geometric distortions and improve data reproducibility. Methods: Five healthy adults were each scanned twice on a 7T MRI scanner (0.9 mm isotropic resolution), using a highly oversampled dMRI protocol with four PE directions (AP, PA, RL, LR). From this dataset, we created and processed eleven time-equivalent, 10-minute acquisitions, ranging from uncorrected single-PE data to comprehensive 4-way PE schemes. These strategies were quantitatively compared on their geometric alignment with T1-weighted images and on the scan-rescan reproducibility of DTI-derived metrics. Results: (1) All distortion-corrected schemes significantly improved geometric accuracy over uncorrected data; (2) Strategies correcting with a full set of reversed-PE (2-way) diffusion weighted images (DWIs) outperformed the common approach of using only a single reversed b=0 image; and (3) a 4-way PE acquisition consistently provided the highest image fidelity and reproducibility. The optimized acquisition enabled high-quality reconstruction of both long-range and fine-scale superficial white matter pathways. Conclusion: For high-resolution 7T dMRI, multi-PE acquisition is essential to achieve accurate geometry and stable microstructural estimates (i.e., less residual EPI distortion and better scan-rescan agreement). A 4-way PE scheme provides the most accurate and reproducible results for microstructural and connectivity modeling. Data statement: Data will be made available in BIDS format in openneuro sharing platform upon acceptance of the manuscript. To be updated with DOI.",

    "title": "Anterior thalamic nucleus inputs to the retrosplenial cortex are unperturbed in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by progressive loss of memory and general decline in cognitive function. Although research has traditionally focused on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, other regions important for memory and spatial navigation, such as the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), are also affected. The RSC is an important brain region for both memory and spatial navigation, and displays dysfunction in humans during prodromal phases of AD. The ATN provide a major input to RSC, with loss of this input to RSC causing a dramatic reduction in the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos. The ATN to RSC connection may thus present a new target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Here, we set out to determine whether AD-like pathology perturbed projections from ATN to RSC using the hAPP-J20 amyloidopathy mouse model, using optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs combined with ex vivo patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that RSC displayed an age-dependent decline in basal c-Fos activity, with no additional effect of amyloid pathology on c-Fos expression. At all time points (3, 6 and 9 months) measured, we found no evidence of impairments in the synaptic strength or efficacy of the ATN projections to either granular or dysgranular subdivisions of RSC. We conclude that, in the hAPP-J20 mouse model, this pathway is unaffected by amyloid-{beta} overexpression.",

    "title": "Molecular dynamics of the pathogenic KCNQ2 variant G256W reveal mechanisms of channel dysfunction in epileptic encephalopathy",
    "content": "Brain voltage-gated potassium channels containing the subunit KCNQ2 are essential for regulating electrical signals contributing to sensation, learning, memory, and motor control. De novo KCNQ2 variants are among the more common Mendelian causes of early life epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment. Some patients with KCNQ2 variants are affected with KCNQ2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2 DEE) characterized by seizures and developmental delays. Children with KCNQ2 DEE exhibit a range of impairment patterns that appear to be correlated with specific consequences of the variant for protein function. Here, we used all-atom molecular dynamics to analyze a pathogenic missense variant KCNQ2 G256W, located in the pore turret. G256W subunit simulations showed migration of the hydrophobic W256 sidechain towards the lipid membrane. This movement affected turret structure and mobility prominently involving K255. We identified novel hydrogen bonding interactions in the wild type KCNQ2 turret region which formed a network that extended to the selectivity filter and identified N258, H260P, and K283 as key residues. Simulations comparing WT and G256W tetrameric channels exhibited more conformationally unstable ion selectivity filters for G256W. We analyzed how different stoichiometries of wild type and G256W subunits, as expected in heterozygous individuals, impacted dynamics and compared the G256W results to three additional variants of the turret-selectivity filter network. Our results provide additional support for an integral role of the KCNQ2 turret selectivity filter stability. The majority of severe KCNQ2 DEE variants are clustered near the selectivity filter in the pore domain. Our study provides insights that may be broadly applicable to this clinically important allele subgroup.",

    "title": "Torsional Force by Helical Pericytes Regulates Blood Flow in Downstream Capillaries",
    "content": "This study investigates the contractile properties of downstream capillaries, which are traditionally regarded as passive conduits, and addresses ongoing debates surrounding blood flow regulation. It is widely accepted that these capillaries passively dilate in response to increased blood flow in upstream microvessels, and that the helical pericytes located on them lack contractile capability, largely due to the absence of detectable a-SMA expression. Challenging this prevailing view, we demonstrate that downstream capillary pericytes do express both a-SMA and Myosin11, as shown using in situ hybridization on whole-mount intact retinas -unlike prior studies that relied on dissociated cells. Furthermore, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis reveals that a-SMA and Myosin11 are in sufficiently close proximity to permit actomyosin bridge cycling, a process essential for contraction. We also show that pericyte contraction can be inhibited by disrupting this molecular interaction. Distinct from the nodal constrictions caused by circular pericyte processes in upstream microvessels, we identify torsional contractions in the downstream capillaries in the retina of living mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM), which regulates blood flow. These contractions provide direct evidence that downstream capillaries actively contribute to blood flow regulation. Notably, such contractions were overlooked in previous TPLSM studies that monitored only luminal diameter, unless the specialized analytical techniques we employed were applied. Our 3D modeling confirms that these torsional contractions correlate with the helical morphology of pericytes in downstream capillaries -a structure previously thought incapable of producing significant constrictive force. In conclusion, our findings provide direct evidence that downstream pericytes play an active role in regulating blood flow. They highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism -torsional contraction- that aligns with the helical structure of these pericytes and contributes to flow regulation in small-caliber capillaries located nearest to regions of high oxygen demand.",

    "title": "Early Diabetic Ca2+ Handling Impairments in the Rod Bipolar Pathway",
    "content": "Background: Previous work showed that electrically-evoked inhibition to Rod Bipolar Cells (RBC) is reduced in a mouse model of early diabetes. It is hypothesized that this is due to impaired Ca2+ handling in the presynaptic amacrine cell, either through increased Ca2+ buffering or decreased influx. To test this hypothesis and develop a mechanism for this effect, a model where direct optogenetic activation of inhibitory amacrine cells that expressed the light-activated channel ChR2 was used to isolate amacrine cell inputs to RBCs. Application of selective Ca2+ channel blockers could then assess potential locations of amacrine Ca2+ disruption. Using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, recordings were made from a 6 week diabetic population (DM) and vehicle injected non-DM animals. Results: Robust GABA C receptor inhibitory currents were recorded from RBCs after ChR2 stimulus that were significantly diminished by the application of nifedipine to block L-typeCa2+ channels in both DM and non-DM conditions. There were significant differences in the peak amplitude of these responses between DM and non- DM groups (p = 0.0146). However, in the non-DM group the decay tau of the response to the 50ms stimulus was significantly diminished by nifedipine ( p =0.0498, n = 5), but this was not seen in the DM group ( p = 0.9498, n=7). A 1s nifedipine-reduced response saw its decay tau increase in the DM group but not the non-DM. Ca2+ - induced Ca2+ release (CICR) blockade with ryanodine decreased responsivity equally between groups in the 1s stimulus but showed no significant kinetic changes. CICR blockade for a 50ms stimulus response showed significant kinetic changes in diabetes but otherwise reduced the response equally between DM and non-DM. Blockade of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) had little effect on the optogenetic response. Conclusion: This study presents evidence that diabetes alters amacrine cell output to the RBC unmasked through blockade of the L-type calcium channel, and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). An apparent explanation for our results is that DM calcium buffering is dysregulated, leading to prolonged responses. The underlying mechanism for this alteration is complex and not yet clearly elucidated.",

    "content": "Intention lies at the core of human behavior, allowing flexible and goal-directed interaction with the environment. However, how it emerges in infancy remains poorly understood. Here we show that intentional action can emerge before overt reaching, revealing that 3-month-old infants display pupil dilation preceding self-initiated actions during interaction with a suspended mobile toy. This phasic pupil dilation first appeared after movement onset but gradually shifted to precede it through environmental interaction, reflecting the emergence of action preparation and prediction of action outcomes. This shift also implies that infants are capable of anticipating the timing of their forthcoming movements. Furthermore, the antecedent pupil dilation occurred only with efficient movements characterised by reduced muscle co-contractions. These findings suggest that infants learn to predict outcomes of their own actions and initiate particular movements at self-determined timings, marking the emergence of intentional action.",

    "title": "N-Linked Glycosylation as a Driver of Tau Pathology and Neuronal Transmission",
    "content": "N-Linked glycosylation of tau is implicated in Alzheimers disease, yet how it influences tau propagation and neuronal uptake remains unclear. Here, we use chemically defined N-glycoforms of 2N4R tau and the K18 repeat domain to map how glycan site and structure reprogram tau-polyanion binding, seeding, and entry into human neurons. Site-specific GlcNAc or high-mannose glycans at Asn359 or Asn410 remodel heparin and RNA binding kinetics in biolayer interferometry assays, revealing avidity-dominated, slow-off heparin interactions that are dampened by N-glycans and faster RNA interactions that can be potentiated by small GlcNAc modifications. Cross-seeding experiments show that N-glycosylation selectively tunes nucleation compatibility between tau proteoforms; GlcNAc at Asn410 in full-length tau and small glycans at Asn359 in K18 most strongly accelerate aggregation. In HEK293T FRET biosensor cells and iPSC-derived cortical neurons, N-glycans enhance or suppress seeding and pHrodo-reported uptake in a site- and glycan-dependent manner, with Asn410 glycosylation markedly potentiating cellular seeding. Pharmacological inhibition with atropine, dynasore, and cytochalasin D further indicates that N-glycans rebalance muscarinic, dynamin-dependent, and actin-dependent uptake routes. Together, these data establish N-linked glycosylation as a tunable regulator of tau trafficking and prion-like spread, coupling extracellular receptor usage to intracellular cofactor engagement, and reveals druggable nodes in uptake.",

    "content": "Objective. As an emerging paradigm of brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs), speech BCI has the potential to directly reflect auditory perception and thoughts, offering a promising communication alternative for patients with aphasia. Chinese is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, whereas there is very limited research on speech BCIs for Chinese language. Approach. This paper reports a text-magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs. It also proposes a multi-modality assisted speech decoding (MASD) algorithm to capture both text and acoustic information embedded in brain signals during speech activities. Main results. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of both our text-MEG dataset and our proposed MASD algorithm. Significance. To our knowledge, this is the first study on multi-modality assisted decoding for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs.",

    "title": "P2CSL: cross-subject EEG classification by subspace class prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling",
    "content": "Objective. Domain adaptation (DA) has achieved remarkable performance in cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding by mitigating the inter-subject data distribution discrepancies. However, when exploring the feature alignment subspace and performing self-supervised pseudo-labeling in an iterative way, two difficulties are often encountered: one is that unreliable target labeling results inevitably mislead the domain-free feature learning process in the early stage and the other is that the contribution of source and target samples should be balanced in the later stage. Approach. To address both issues, this paper proposes prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling (P2CSL) method to use subspace class prototypes to assist in labeling target samples under the unified framework of domain-invariant EEG feature learning and the self-supervised target sample labeling, and progressively incorporate confident target samples into DA model fitting. The underlying rationality is that early-stage pseudo-labels from unconverged models are prone to error propagation, requiring auxiliary mechanisms to ensure their reliability and stabilize training. With the gradual alignment of cross-subject features, the estimated pseudo-label information of target domain will be more reliable, meaning that more target samples should be involved in model training. Main results. Experiments on emotion recognition and inner speech decoding demonstrate the competitive performance of P2CSL in cross-subject EEG classification in comparison with SOTA methods. Significance. Our study indicates the effectiveness of jointly considering the reliability of target samples and their contribution to model training in the context of DA. In addition, some fine-grained results including the sample confidence allocation strategy, the DA effects, and the dynamic model optimization process are provided to further illustrate the model execution details.",

    "title": "Towards optimizing target engagement in non-invasive trigeminal nerve stimulation: anatomical characterization of the human trigeminal nerve",
    "content": "Objective. Cranial nerve stimulation uses electric current to modulate higher-order brain activity and organ function via nerves, including the vagus and trigeminal, with applications in migraine, epilepsy, and pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The trigeminal nerve is an emerging target for non-invasive neuromodulation due to the superficial trajectory of its branches, the supraorbital (SON), infraorbital (ION), and mental nerves (MN), and the predominantly sensory composition of the SON and ION. However, the parameters and outcomes of trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) remain varied. Approach. This study characterizes the anatomical course and tissue composition of the SON, ION, and MN using five human donors. Computed tomography imaging was used to localize each nerve\u2019s exit foramen and distance to midline. Microdissections quantified nerve circumference and depth relative to the skin surface. Histological analysis described the number of fascicles and fascicular tissue area. Nerve depths were incorporated into an illustrative finite element model to assess the effect of interface properties on activation of on- and off-target neural pathways. Main results. Cadaveric measurements, histological analyses, and imaging outline the depths, branching patterns, and fascicular organization within the trigeminal nerve branches. The SON was found to be significantly more superficial than the ION and MN with a higher nerve-to-connective tissue ratio compared to the MN. Our illustrative modeling demonstrated that depth was a driving factor for neural activation and sensitivity to skin impedance properties. Significance. The SON presents the most accessible and anatomically favorable target for transcutaneous TNS among the branches examined due to its superficial location. Consistent with our previous work, however, preferential activation of low-threshold nociceptors compared to nerve trunks may lead to treatment-limiting off-target side effects. These findings offer an anatomically informed framework to guide further modeling, electrode design, and in situ imaging of nerve branching patterns to better estimate activation of on- and off- target pathways.",

    "title": "Focal thalamic infrared neural stimulation propagates dynamical transformations in auditory cortex",
    "content": "Objective. Infrared neural stimulation (INS) has emerged as a potent neuromodulation technology, offering safe and focal stimulation with superior spatial recruitment profiles compared to conventional electrical methods. However, the neural dynamics induced by INS stimulation remain poorly understood. Elucidating these dynamics will help develop new INS stimulation paradigms and advance its clinical application. Approach. In this study, we assessed the local network dynamics of INS entrainment in the auditory thalamocortical circuit using the chronically implanted rat model. Our approach focused on measuring INS energy-based local field potential (LFP) recruitment induced by focal thalamocortical stimulation. We further characterized linear and nonlinear oscillatory LFP activity in response to single-pulse and periodic INS and performed spectral decomposition to uncover specific LFP band entrainment to INS. Finally, we examined spike-field transformations across the thalamocortical synapse using spike-LFP coherence coupling measures. Main results. We found that INS significantly increases LFP amplitude as a log-linear function of INS energy per pulse, primarily entraining to LFP \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands with synchrony extending to 200 Hz in some cases. A subset of neurons demonstrated nonlinear, chaotic oscillations linked to information transfer across cortical circuits. Finally, we utilized spike-field coherences to correlate spike coupling to LFP frequency band activity and suggest an energy-dependent model of network activation resulting from INS stimulation. Significance. We show that INS reliably drives robust network activity and can potently modulate cortical field potentials across a wide range of frequencies in a stimulus parameter-dependent manner. Based on these results, we propose design principles for developing full coverage, all-optical thalamocortical auditory neuroprostheses.",

    "title": "Distance of bipolar re-referencing imparts nonlinear frequency-specific influences on intracranial recording signal measurements",
    "content": "Obective. Bipolar re-referencing (BPRR), in which one electrode\u2019s signal is subtracted from a neighboring electrode to produce a differential signal, can improve signal readability and refine localization for intracranial electroencephalography. There is wide variation in manufactured electrode array spacing, yet how BPRR affects specific frequencies at precise inter-electrode distances has not been systematically evaluated. Approach. Intracranial recordings with uniquely large numbers of electrodes were obtained for sixteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We evaluated combinations of high-density subdural grid, depth, and strip electrodes (n = 3,664, 742, and 336) with manufactured linear inter-electrode distances of 4, 5, and 10 mm, respectively. BPRR was performed using all possible electrode pairs (n = 445 305 grid, 16 004 depth, 3278 strip) spanning distances from 2\u201360 mm. Multi-taper power spectra were generated separately for grid, depth, and strip contacts. Distances were consolidated across patients and anatomical areas for generalizability, and distance-related influences on task-related brain activity and quantitative interictal epileptiform discharge localization were evaluated. Main results. We identified 8 mm as a consistent reversal point for BPRR, below which low-frequency signals (<30 Hz) had consistently decreased power, and higher frequencies had increased power. Larger distances increased all broadband (2\u2013200 Hz) signals. Task-related increases in superior temporal gyrus 50\u2013200 Hz activity were consistently enhanced across 4\u201340 mm bipolar distances. There were non-significant difference trends between 4 and 8 mm re-referencing on epileptiform discharge detection. Significance. BPRR distance imposed specific transition points for distance and frequency (roughly 8 mm and \u223c30 Hz, respectively) that produced differential effects on measurements of signal power. The consistency across brain regions and electrode types (depth, subdural) suggests these influences are physical brain bio-signal properties, potentially related to spatial wavelength of periodic oscillations in lower frequencies in contrast to more aperiodic activity in higher frequencies. A distance-frequency relation map is provided to help optimize neural signal biomarker quality for intracranial applications by guiding strategic re-referencing distance selection.",

    "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, a non-invasive spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope to restore functions in individuals with paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy, stroke and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are relatively few options for such stimulation devices compared to conventional stimulators commonly used for neuromuscular electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation, particularly for people with neurological conditions in the developing countries. Approach. In this report, we present OpenXstim, an open-source, two-channel programmable electrical stimulator developed to advance research in non-invasive muscle, nerve, or spinal cord stimulation treatments. Main results. OpenXstim can deliver current pulses up to 110 mA with a compliance voltage of 96 V per channel. In benchtop testing, we found that the stimulator successfully generates high frequency (9 kHz) burst stimulation, a mode commonly used for spinal cord neuromodulation. The stimulator was further tested in two individuals with SCI and showed preliminary indications of functional improvement. However, large controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. Although special care was taken in the design of the stimulator to ensure user safety, users are strongly warned to handle the device with utmost caution, as it can generate high voltage and current that may cause adverse health effects if not used properly. Significance. This programmable, open-source stimulator offers tangible hope for improving the accessibility of non-invasive neuromodulation treatments for people with paralysis worldwide.

    "title": "Spectral brain connectivity in dementia: coherence, imaginary coherence and partial coherence analysis of EEG signals",
    "content": "Objective. As the prevalence of dementia continues to rise, the need for accurate and early diagnostic tools becomes increasingly critical. Despite diverse underlying causes, dementia types share common cognitive symptoms, making accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Approach: This study investigates electroencephalographic (EEG)-based spectral brain connectivity in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD, ), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, ), and healthy controls (HCs, ), with the dual aim of identifying condition-specific connectivity patterns and evaluating three coherence-based connectivity measures: coherence, imaginary coherence, and partial coherence. Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data (19 channels) were analyzed, and connectivity was estimated across frequencies to assess both global and local network alterations. Main results. The results indicate that dementias (both AD and FTD) are characterized by decreased connectivity in higher frequency bands and increased connectivity in lower frequencies, reflecting respectively impaired neural communication and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates with the spatial extent and magnitude of connectivity disruptions. Notably, partial coherence\u2014unlike coherence and imaginary coherence\u2014effectively distinguishes between the AD and FTD groups, suggesting that direct connectivity measures may provide more discriminative information for differential diagnosis. Significance. These findings highlight the potential of EEG-based spectral connectivity analysis, particularly partial coherence, as a non-invasive tool to aid in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes, supporting early clinical decision-making.",

    "content": "Objective. Group interactions capture cooperative dynamics among neural populations quantitatively, while also enabling precise detection of ensemble-level synchrony patterns and transcending the limitations of node-level relationships. To evaluate higher-order group interactions, we propose the PLASSO-homophily framework using multichannel stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recorded from patients with epilepsy. Approach. Specifically, we use phase locking value to improve least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method for constructing hypergraphs. Afterwards, we calculate affinity ratios between brain zones. Finally, we investigate higher-order interactions among different groups from a homophily perspective. The extremal result of strict homophily serves as a crucial theoretical framework for understanding homophily concepts, reflecting the constraints that different groups follow in higher-order interactions. Main results. It is observed that group interactions between seizure onset zones (SOZ), propagation zones (PZ) and non-involved zones (NIZ) present significant distinction across different seizure phases. In particular, the homophily of SOZ reaches a peak point during the seizure and sharply decreases in the post-seizure, with the most statistically significant differences on and bands. Furthermore, during the seizure, SOZ-PZ exhibits enhanced coupling while SOZ-NIZ exhibits impaired functional integration. Finally, among three groups, only SOZ exhibits strict monotonic and majority homophily. Significance. By analyzing changes in in-class and out-class connectivity, we quantitatively assess the activity levels and combinatorial constraints of the SOZ, PZ, and NIZ, thereby providing a novel perspective for exploring seizure mechanisms and developing epilepsy treatments.",

    "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
    "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

    "title": "N-Linked Glycosylation as a Driver of Tau Pathology and Neuronal Transmission",
    "content": "N-Linked glycosylation of tau is implicated in Alzheimers disease, yet how it influences tau propagation and neuronal uptake remains unclear. Here, we use chemically defined N-glycoforms of 2N4R tau and the K18 repeat domain to map how glycan site and structure reprogram tau-polyanion binding, seeding, and entry into human neurons. Site-specific GlcNAc or high-mannose glycans at Asn359 or Asn410 remodel heparin and RNA binding kinetics in biolayer interferometry assays, revealing avidity-dominated, slow-off heparin interactions that are dampened by N-glycans and faster RNA interactions that can be potentiated by small GlcNAc modifications. Cross-seeding experiments show that N-glycosylation selectively tunes nucleation compatibility between tau proteoforms; GlcNAc at Asn410 in full-length tau and small glycans at Asn359 in K18 most strongly accelerate aggregation. In HEK293T FRET biosensor cells and iPSC-derived cortical neurons, N-glycans enhance or suppress seeding and pHrodo-reported uptake in a site- and glycan-dependent manner, with Asn410 glycosylation markedly potentiating cellular seeding. Pharmacological inhibition with atropine, dynasore, and cytochalasin D further indicates that N-glycans rebalance muscarinic, dynamin-dependent, and actin-dependent uptake routes. Together, these data establish N-linked glycosylation as a tunable regulator of tau trafficking and prion-like spread, coupling extracellular receptor usage to intracellular cofactor engagement, and reveals druggable nodes in uptake.",

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "title": "Brain atrophy and cholinergic denervation in progressive supranuclear palsy: an MRI and [18F]-FEOBV PET study",
    "content": "IntroductionProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of motor and cognitive impairments. Structural brain imaging biomarkers, such as the Magnetic Resonance Parkinsonism Index 2.0 (MRPI 2.0), are increasingly recognized as means of supporting a PSP diagnosis. These anatomic measures lack neurobiological correlates. In the present work, we investigated whether structural brain changes captured by MRPI 2.0 associate with whole-brain and regional cholinergic nerve terminal deficits in PSP.MethodsStructural magnetic resonance (MR) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) [18F]-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18F]-FEOBV) PET imaging was obtained in a sample of 16 PSP subjects. MRPI 2.0 index was quantified and correlated with whole brain VAChT binding using statistical parametric mapping (SPM), after adjustment for sex, dopaminergic medication dose and disease duration. Post hoc multiple regression analyses were performed to correlate regional mean VAChT binding with MRPI 2.0 (after adjusting for the same covariates), characterizing the proportion of variance in cholinergic terminal deficits explained by this structural index.ResultsVoxel-wise SPM analyses revealed that MRPI 2.0 is significantly associated with cholinergic nerve terminal loss in brainstem, especially pontomesencephalic, limbic structures, insula, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellar regions. Post hoc multiple regression analysis demonstrated that MRPI 2.0 accounts for about half of the variance in cholinergic nerve terminal integrity within relevant brain structures in PSP, showing the most robust association in the thalamus.DiscussionStructural brain changes associated with higher MRPI 2.0 index scores may be a reliable proxy measure of cholinergic terminal deficits in PSP, predominantly those in subcortical regions. Differential association of subcortical brain region cholinergic deficits with PSP-specific structural brain changes may reflect the characteristic pattern of 4R-tau pathology observed in PSP.",

    "title": "Early heart disease prediction using LV-PSO and Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolution Neural Network on phonocardiogram signals",
    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

    "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",
