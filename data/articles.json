    "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
    "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "content": "Trauma is the fourth leading cause of death globally and the primary cause of mortality in the 15\u201345 age group, with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the core of trauma care. Annually, over 50 million TBI patients are reported worldwide. The complex and heterogeneous pathophysiology of TBI presents substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. In recent years, multimodal monitoring has emerged as a crucial tool to guide clinical management. The integration of multimodal monitoring with machine learning offers novel opportunities for TBI assessment and management, given the rapid development and widespread application of machine learning approaches. Therapeutic hypothermia has shown potential neuroprotective benefits in experimental and clinical contexts, though evidence remains mixed and its implementation in practice faces significant challenges. This review summarizes recent advancements in multimodal monitoring and explores how machine learning can optimize the application of therapeutic hypothermia in conjunction with multimodal data. For example, predictive models trained on multimodal signals (e.g., EEG, ICP, cerebral blood flow, and oxygenation) can help identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit from targeted temperature management. By enabling such stratification and adaptive treatment strategies, machine learning may support the development of more personalized and effective therapeutic approaches for TBI.",

    "content": "IntroductionDisorders of consciousness (DoC), including unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS), are primarily diagnosed behaviorally. Recent evidence indicates that loss of consciousness manifests as irregularities in neural oscillatory activity across delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. However, conventional spectral analysis often conflates periodic oscillations with aperiodic 1/f components, potentially obscuring consciousness-related dynamics.MethodsTo elucidate the mechanistic basis of spectral alterations in consciousness impairment, we compared oscillatory and aperiodic activity patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of patients with different consciousness levels. We further examined the spatiotemporal variability of these neural signatures and rigorously evaluated their discriminative power for state classification using support vector machine (SVM) analysis.ResultsWhile periodic and aperiodic activities are independent, our results indicate that both components exhibit significant differences between groups at both local and global scales. Critically, higher spatial and temporal variability of aperiodic features (spectral exponent) were correlated with preserved consciousness. When distinguishing UWS from MCS, the combination of periodic and aperiodic features significantly improved classification performance compared to using either metric alone.DiscussionOur findings demonstrate that both periodic oscillations and aperiodic activity provide valuable information about consciousness levels. Critically, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the aperiodic component serve as a key marker of brain state. This underscores the necessity of accounting for aperiodic activity in mechanistic studies and clinical assessments of DoC.",

    "content": "BackgroundOptimisation of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) settings is a key aspect in achieving clinical efficacy in movement disorders, such as the Parkinson\u2019s disease. Modern techniques attempt to solve the problem through data-intensive statistical and machine learning approaches, adding significant overhead to the existing clinical workflows. Here, we present a geometry-based optimisation approach for DBS electrode contact and current selection, grounded in routinely collected MRI data, well-established tools (Lead-DBS) and optionally, clinical review records.MethodsThe pipeline, packaged in a cross-platform tool, uses lead reconstruction data and simulation of Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA) to estimate the contacts in optimal position relative to the target structure, and suggests optimal stimulation current. The tool then allows further interactive user optimisation of the current settings. Existing electrode contact evaluations can be optionally included in the calculation process for further fine-tuning and adverse effect avoidance.ResultsBased on a sample of 174 implanted electrode reconstructions from 87 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, we demonstrate that our algorithm\u2019s DBS parameter settings are more effective in covering the target structure (Wilcoxon p\u202f<\u202f5e-13, Hedges\u2019 g\u202f>\u202f0.94) and minimising electric field leakage to neighbouring regions (p\u202f<\u202f2e-10, g\u202f>\u202f0.46) compared to expert parameter settings. Retrospective analysis of a limited subset (n\u202f=\u202f50) predicts comparable improved motor outcomes with expert settings (g\u202f=\u202f0.05\u20130.08, p\u202f=\u202f0.09\u20131), suggesting potential for similar clinical efficacy, pending prospective validation.ConclusionThe proposed automated method for optimisation of the DBS electrode contact and current selection shows promising results and is readily applicable to existing clinical workflows. We demonstrate that the algorithmically selected contacts perform better than manual selections according to electric field calculations, without the iterative optimisation procedure.",

The current preregistered study (<em>N</em> = 104) used a 3-week longitudinal design to investigate the relationships between the frequency of recalled NBMs, memory distrust, rumination over autobiographical events, and self-esteem. Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Relationship between thought suppression and dissociation and the mediating effect of rumination and unusual sleep experiences.",
    "content": "Dissociation is a phenomenon present in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders as well as in the general population. The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "title": "Mental pain, boredom, and diffuse nociception.",
    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.18037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.",

    "content": "Understanding how distributed brain regions coordinate to produce behavior requires models that are both predictive and interpretable. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation (BACE), an end-to-end framework that learns phase-specific, directed inter-regional connectivity directly from multi-region intracranial local field potentials (LFP). BACE aggregates many micro contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders, applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines. Applied to human subcortical LFP recorded simultaneously from eight regions during a cued reaching task, BACE yields an explicit connectivity matrix for each within trial behavioral phase. The resulting behavioral phase specific graphs reveal behavior-aligned reconfiguration of inter-regional influence and provide compact, interpretable adjacency matrices for comparing network organization across behavioral phases. By linking predictive success to explicit connectivity estimates, BACE offers a practical tool for generating data-driven hypotheses about the dynamic coordination of subcortical regions during behavior.",

    "title": "Efficient in vivo pharmacological inhibition of deltaFOSB, an AP1 transcription factor, in brain",
    "content": "DeltaFOSB, an unusually stable member of the AP1 family of transcription factors, mediates long-term maladaptations that play a key role in the pathogenesis of drug addiction, cognitive decline, dyskinesias, and several other chronic neurological and psychiatric conditions. We have recently identified that 2-phenoxybenzenesulfonic acid-containing compounds disrupt the binding of deltaFOSB to DNA in vitro in cell-based assays, and one such compound, JPC0661, disrupts deltaFOSB binding to genomic DNA in vivo in mouse brain with partial efficiency. JPC0661 binds to a groove outside of the DNA-binding cleft of the deltaFOSB/JUND bZIP heterodimer in the co-crystal structure. Here, we generated a panel of analogs of JPC0661 with the goal of establishing structure-activity relationships and improving its in vivo efficacy by replacing the amino-pyrazolone cap moiety with various substituents. We show that one such analog, YL0441, disrupts the binding of deltaFOSB to DNA in vitro and in vivo, and suppresses deltaFOSB-function in cell-based assays. Importantly, infusion of YL0441 into the hippocampus of APP mice (a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease) leads to virtually complete loss of deltaFOSB bound to genomic DNA by CUT&amp;RUN sequencing. Our findings corroborate that DNA binding/release of AP1 transcription factors can be controlled via small molecules, even by analogs of a compound that binds to a groove outside of the DNA-binding cleft, and that our lead can be optimized via medicinal chemistry to yield a highly efficacious inhibitor of deltaFOSB function in vivo. These findings define a strategy to design small-molecule inhibitors for other AP1- and AP1-related transcription factors.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

At 2.8\u202fyears of age, electroencephalography (EEG) showed SWAS, leading to regression in cognitive, motor, and language functions. Administration of multiple anti-seizure medications (ASMs) achieved poor efficacy, and repeated corticosteroids resulted in only transient improvement. He was treated with VNS at 4.8\u202fyears of age. Seizure freedom was achieved at 1.3\u202fyears postoperatively. The SWAS pattern was not observed on follow-up EEG 2\u202fyears after implantation. Concurrently, his neurodevelopment improved. No new ASMs or corticosteroids were added during this period. VNS was interrupted due to pulse generator battery depletion at 5.6\u202fyears after implantation. Increased SWI was showed on the EEG 6\u202fmonths after the interruption of stimulation.ConclusionEarly VNS intervention should be considered in addition to conventional medication for young children with SWAS who have greater distance from the self-limited age.",

    "content": "Objective. Spike sorting, which involves detecting and attributing spikes to their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, is a common process in electrophysiology and brain\u2013computer interface systems. Recent advances in large-scale neural recording technologies are challenging the conventional algorithms because of the intensive computational workloads required and the accuracy degradation suffered from time-variant spike patterns and significant levels of noise. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated promising performance in processing these large-scale neural recordings. However, their applications are constrained by the labor-intensive data labeling and the lack of fully vectorized frameworks with end-to-end NNs. Approach. We propose E-Sort, an end-to-end NN-based spike sorter with transfer learning and parallelizable post-processing to address both obstacles. Main results. We examined our framework in both synthetic and real datasets. The results of the processing of the synthetic datasets show that our approach can reduce the number of annotated spikes required for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.7% higher accuracy. We evaluated E-Sort on various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift patterns, which demonstrates that our design can achieve an accuracy that is comparable with Kilosort4 while sorting 50\u2009s of data in only 1.32\u2009s. To test with real datasets, we first sorted the spikes using Kilosort4 and used the sorted spikes at the initial period to pre-train the NN; then we compared and measured the agreement between the results from the trained model and those from Kilosort4. On average the pre-training process improved the result agreement by 30% approximately. Significance. E-Sort offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate NN-based framework for large-scale spike sorting, significantly reducing manual labeling effort and processing time.",

    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "title": "\"Over-the-Hood\" AI Inclusivity Bugs and How 3 AI Product Teams Found and Fixed Them",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.19033v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While much research has shown the presence of AI's \"under-the-hood\" biases (e.g., algorithmic, training data, etc.), what about \"over-the-hood\" inclusivity biases: barriers in user-facing AI products that disproportionately exclude users with certain problem-solving approaches? Recent research has begun to report the existence of such biases -- but what do they look like, how prevalent are they, and how can developers find and fix them? To find out, we conducted a field study with 3 AI product teams, to investigate what kinds of AI inclusivity bugs exist uniquely in user-facing AI products, and whether/how AI product teams might harness an existing (non-AI-oriented) inclusive design method to find and fix them. The teams' work resulted in identifying 6 types of AI inclusivity bugs arising 83 times, fixes covering 47 of these bug instances, and a new variation of the GenderMag inclusive design method, GenderMag-for-AI, that is especially effective at detecting certain kinds of AI inclusivity bugs.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

However, these methods require substantial resources, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this study, we introduce CLiVR, a Conversational Learning system in Virtual Reality that integrates large language models (LLMs), speech processing, and 3D avatars to simulate realistic doctor-patient interactions. Developed in Unity and deployed on the Meta Quest 3 platform, CLiVR enables trainees to engage in natural dialogue with virtual patients. Each simulation is dynamically generated from a syndrome-symptom database and enhanced with sentiment analysis to provide feedback on communication tone. Through an expert user study involving medical school faculty (n=13), we assessed usability, realism, and perceived educational impact. Results demonstrated strong user acceptance, high confidence in educational potential, and valuable feedback for improvement. CLiVR offers a scalable, immersive supplement to SP-based training.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.19024v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI-generated images are increasingly prevalent on social media, raising concerns about trust and authenticity. This study investigates how different levels of label detail (basic, moderate, maximum) and content stakes (high vs. low) influence user engagement with and perceptions of AI-generated images through a within-subjects experimental study with 105 participants. Our findings reveal that increasing label detail enhances user perceptions of label transparency but does not affect user engagement. However, content stakes significantly impact user engagement and perceptions, with users demonstrating higher engagement and trust in low-stakes images. These results suggest that social media platforms can adopt detailed labels to improve transparency without compromising user engagement, offering insights for effective labeling strategies for AI-generated content.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.19017v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Elderly people with speech impairments often face challenges in engaging in meaningful social communication, particularly when using Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) tools that primarily address basic needs. Moreover, effective chats often rely on personal memories, which is hard to extract and reuse. We introduce SocializeChat, an AAC tool that generates sentence suggestions by drawing on users' personal memory records. By incorporating topic preference and interpersonal closeness, the system reuses past experience and tailors suggestions to different social contexts and conversation partners. SocializeChat not only leverages past experiences to support interaction, but also treats conversations as opportunities to create new memories, fostering a dynamic cycle between memory and communication. A user study shows its potential to enhance the inclusivity and relevance of AAC-supported social interaction.",

Using human+synthetic curriculum design with fairness-aware scenarios and ethical enhancements, PVM identifies core values, conflicts, and accessibility requirements to inform inclusive principles. Our privacy-focused prototype features adaptive safety scaffolds, tailored interactions (e.g., step-by-step guidance for Neurodivergent users, simple wording for children), and equitable conflict resolution. In preliminary evaluations, PVM outperforms multi-agent baselines in compliance (76% vs. 70%), fairness (90% vs. 85%), safety-violation rate (0% vs. 7%), and latency. Design innovations, including video guidance, autonomy sliders, family hubs, and adaptive safety dashboards, demonstrate new directions for ethical and inclusive domestic AI, for building user-centered agentic systems in plural domestic contexts.

Advanced browser extensions now enable large language models (LLMs) to answer questions presented in online exams within seconds, thereby compromising the security of these assessments. In this study, the behaviors of students (N = 52) on an online exam platform during a proctored, face-to-face exam were analyzed using clustering methods, with the aim of identifying groups of students exhibiting suspicious behavior potentially associated with cheating. Additionally, students in different clusters were compared in terms of their exam scores. Suspicious exam behaviors in this study were defined as selecting text within the question area, right-clicking, and losing focus on the exam page. The total frequency of these behaviors performed by each student during the exam was extracted, and k-Means clustering was employed for the analysis. The findings revealed that students were classified into six clusters based on their suspicious behaviors. It was found that students in four of the six clusters, representing approximately 33% of the total sample, exhibited suspicious behaviors at varying levels. When the exam scores of these students were compared, it was observed that those who engaged in suspicious behaviors scored, on average, 30-40 points higher than those who did not. Although further research is necessary to validate these findings, this preliminary study provides significant insights into the detection of AI-assisted cheating in online exams using behavior analytics.",

Large language models (LLMs) may provide tailored, accessible information, but also risk being inaccurate, biased or misleading. We present insights from 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), examining how people interact with LLMs for their own health questions. Qualitative studies revealed the importance of context-seeking in conversational AIs to elicit specific details a person may not volunteer or know to share. Context-seeking by LLMs was valued by participants, even if it meant deferring an answer for several turns. Incorporating these insights, we developed a \"Wayfinding AI\" to proactively solicit context. In a randomized, blinded study, participants rated the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns compared to a baseline AI. These results demonstrate the strong impact of proactive context-seeking on conversational dynamics, and suggest design patterns for conversational AI to help navigate health topics.",

This study uses human memory research as a lens for understanding LLMs and systematically investigates human memory effects in state-of-the-art LLMs using paradigms drawn from psychological research. We evaluate seven key memory phenomena, comparing human behavior to LLM performance. Both people and models remember less when overloaded with information (list length effect) and remember better with repeated exposure (list strength effect). They also show similar difficulties when retrieving overlapping information, where storing too many similar facts leads to confusion (fan effect). Like humans, LLMs are susceptible to falsely \"remembering\" words that were never shown but are related to others (false memories), and they can apply prior learning to new, related situations (cross-domain generalization). However, LLMs differ in two key ways: they are less influenced by the order in which information is presented (positional bias) and more robust when processing random or meaningless material (nonsense effect). These results reveal both alignments and divergences in how LLMs and humans reconstruct memory. The findings help clarify how memory-like behavior in LLMs echoes core features of human cognition, while also highlighting the architectural differences that lead to distinct patterns of error and success.",

    "content": "arXiv:2508.18404v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Although visual search appears largely random, several oculomotor biases exist such that the likelihoods of saccade directions and lengths depend on the previous scan path. Compared to the most recent fixations, the impact of the longer path history is more difficult to quantify. Using the step-selection framework commonly used in movement ecology, and analyzing data from 45-second viewings of \"Where's Waldo?\", we report a new memory-dependent effect that also varies significantly between individuals, which we term self-crossing avoidance. This is a tendency for saccades to avoid crossing those earlier in the scan path, and is most evident when both have small amplitudes. We show this by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless approximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model with a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time). Maximum likelihood fitting indicates that this effect is strongest when including the last $\\approx 7$ seconds of a scan path. The effect size is comparable to well-known forms of history dependence such as inhibition of return. A parametric probabilistic model including a self-crossing penalty term was able to reproduce joint statistics of saccade lengths and self-crossings. We also quantified individual strategic differences, and their consistency over the six images viewed per participant, using mixed-effect regressions. Participants with a higher tendency to avoid crossings displayed smaller saccade lengths and shorter fixation durations on average, but did not display more horizontal, vertical, forward or reverse saccades. Together, these results indicate that the avoidance of crossings is a local orienting strategy that facilitates and complements inhibition of return, and hence exploration of visual scenes.",

This requires decomposing mutual information into contributions from individual stimuli and stimulus features: a fundamentally ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions. We address this by introducing three core axioms, additivity, positivity, and locality that any meaningful stimulus-wise decomposition should satisfy. We then derive a decomposition that meets all three criteria and remains tractable for high-dimensional stimuli. Our decomposition can be efficiently estimated using diffusion models, allowing for scaling up to complex, structured and naturalistic stimuli. Applied to a model of visual neurons, our method quantifies how specific stimuli and features contribute to encoded information. Our approach provides a scalable, interpretable tool for probing representations in both biological and artificial neural systems.",

The aim is to measure their effectiveness in characterizing NDs, including AD and PD. To this end, task-agnostic and task-specific features are extracted from 14 distinct tasks. Subsequently, through statistical analysis and a series of classification experiments, we investigate which features provide greater discriminative power between NDs and healthy controls and amongst different NDs. Preliminary results indicate that the tasks at hand can all be effectively leveraged to distinguish between the considered set of NDs, specifically by measuring the stability, the speed of writing, the time spent not writing, and the pressure variations between groups from our handcrafted interpretable features, which shows a statistically significant difference between groups, across multiple tasks. Using various binary classification algorithms on the computed features, we obtain up to 87% accuracy for the discrimination between AD and healthy controls (CTL), and up to 69% for the discrimination between PD and CTL.",

In 1960, Baumgartner proposed a hypothesis for the illusion based on neural receptive fields, but Geier presented a counterexample in 2008. In 1995, Schrauf devised the scintillating grid illusion, an improvement on the Hermann grid illusion. I propose that a hypothesis involving blind spots (optic discs) can significantly contribute to unraveling the mystery of the grid illusion.",

    "title": "Category learning in deep neural networks: Information content and geometry of internal representations",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.19021v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii) building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near, the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.",

    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

    "content": "Objective. Chronic pain affects over 20% of the adult population in the United States, posing a substantial personal as well as economic burden and contributing to the ongoing opioid crisis. Effective, non-addictive chronic pain treatments are urgently needed. Traditional drug discovery methods have failed to identify novel, non-addictive compounds, highlighting the need for alternative approaches such as phenotypic screening. Our lab developed a phenotypic screening assay using extracellular electrophysiological recordings from co-cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cell sensory neurons and glia. This study aimed to identify responsive neuronal subtypes within these presumptively heterogeneous cultures. Approach. We induced an inflammation-like state using tumor necrosis factor alpha and evaluated acute responses to nociceptor agonist capsaicin, which targets transient receptor potential vanilloid-1. By employing unsupervised learning, we labeled responsive cells based on changes in mean firing rates (MFR). We then used the labeled cells\u2019 baseline activity to train and validate five classifiers. Main results. None of the classifiers outperformed the others in regards to accuracy. Nonetheless, an RUS-boosted ensemble of decision trees achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.877 classifying nociceptors in an unseen labeled culture. Significance. The notable accuracy suggests that machine learning techniques could be employed to enhance microelectrode array-based neuronal phenotypic assays as readouts (e.g. MFR) can be weighted based on target cell type (e.g. nociceptors).",

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
    "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "title": "Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs",
    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "India is a profoundly diverse nation-state where constitutional provisions for two official and 22 Scheduled languages overlay a vast substratum of numerous Non-Scheduled languages and over a thousand distinct mother tongues, creating a rich and layered linguistic hierarchy. The trajectory of linguistic growth of young Indians is invariably multilingual and multidialectal and involves at least one L1, followed most often by Hindi and English or other languages. We carried out a qualitative study with over over a thousand students entering university using a modified LEAP questionnaire for self-assessment of fluency, literacy, domain of use, and time course of language acquisition and loss. We explore the interaction between heritage language, multilingualism, and the formal (trilingual) education policy and show that they intersect to redraw the linguistic profiles of individuals with shifting language dominance, and impact linguistic ability, especially in L1. We also find that the understanding of \u201cheritage language\u201d needs to be more nuanced in this particular context of multilingualism and language acquisition.",

    "title": "Aligning machines and minds: neural encoding for high-level visual cortices based on image captioning task",
    "content": "Objective. Neural encoding of visual stimuli aims to predict brain responses in the visual cortex to different external inputs. Deep neural networks trained on relatively simple tasks such as image classification have been widely applied in neural encoding studies of early visual areas. However, due to the complex and abstract nature of semantic representations in high-level visual cortices, their encoding performance and interpretability remain limited. Approach. We propose a novel neural encoding model guided by the image captioning task. During image captioning, an attention module is employed to focus on key visual objects. In the neural encoding stage, a flexible receptive field (RF) module is designed to simulate voxel-level visual fields. To bridge the domain gap between these two processes, we introduce the Atten-RF module, which effectively aligns attention-guided visual representations with voxel-wise brain activity patterns. Main results. Experiments on the large-scale natural scenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior average encoding performance across seven high-level visual cortices, with a mean squared error of 0.765, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.443, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.245. Significance. By leveraging the guidance and alignment provided by a complex vision-language task, our model enhances the prediction of voxel activity in high-level visual cortex, offering a new perspective on the neural encoding problem. Furthermore, various visualization techniques provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual information processing.",

The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Flying dreams stimulated by targeted movement and sound: Art and science in the dream hotel.",
    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "title": "Nightmare disorder in women.",
    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

    "content": "The aim of this study was to assess whether participants who present more frequently with nightmares or distressing dreams have had traumatic experiences in their childhood and their relationship with current personality traits. Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

    "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

    "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization.

    "title": "Dual Role of LH-GABA Neurons in Encoding Alcohol Reward and Aversive Memories",
    "content": "One of the core aspects of alcohol use disorder is continued use despite negative consequences. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder typically engage in behaviors which represent a failure to integrate the aversive consequences of their actions. The neural mechanisms of learning about conflicting rewarding and aversive experiences remain poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of GABAergic neurons in the Lateral Hypothalamus (LH-GABA) in rewarding memories and motivation. However, whether this role extends to aversive outcomes, and competition between rewarding and aversive outcomes remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of LH-GABA neurons in encoding and expressing alcohol reward and aversive memories using fiber photometry calcium imaging. We used a dual-virus approach to confine expression of the fluorescent calcium indicator jGCaMP7f to GABAergic neurons in LH of Long-Evans rats. In our first experiment, following acquisition of a cue-alcohol association, a mild foot shock was introduced on 50% of the trials. In the second experiment, we trained rats to associate three different cues with either alcohol, foot-shock, or no consequence. Subsequently, we combined these conditioned stimuli in pairs to evoke motivational conflict. Our results reveal that LH-GABA activity is associated with cues predictive of both appetitive and aversive outcomes and is highest to a cue predictive of an aversive outcome. Additionally, LH-GABA activity responds to an aversive shock stimulus, but this response is attenuated in the presence of alcohol. In summary, our findings show the activity of LH-GABA neurons is involved in learning both appetitive and aversive associations, and their interaction in conflict.",

    "content": "Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is a signalling scaffold within the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses which drives silent synapse maturation during critical periods (CP). Binocularity develops during visual CPs and matures before its closure. Despite lifelong critical period plasticity, PSD-95 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit relatively subtle sensory phenotypes as adult mice in standard cage housing. To assess PSD-95s role in ethologically relevant binocular visual processing, we compared prey capture behaviour in PSD-95 KO and wild-type (WT) mice. KO mice were profoundly impaired in diverse epochs of predatory behaviour, but exhibited improved prey localisation under monocular conditions, indicating impaired binocular integration. This was confirmed in an orientation discrimination task, where KO mice were impaired binocularly but performed monocularly like WT mice. Our results depict a critical role of PSD-95 to drive binocular maturation which becomes evident under ethologically demanding behaviours.",

    "title": "Expression and localization of NMDA receptor GluN2 subunits in dorsal horn pain circuits across sex, species, and late postnatal development",
    "content": "Despite being essential mediators of pain processing, the molecular identity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subtypes in nociceptive dorsal horn circuits is poorly understood, especially between sexes and in humans. Given the importance of GluN2 subunits in shaping NMDAR function and plasticity, we investigated the expression and localization of specific GluN2 NMDAR variants in the dorsal horn of viable spinal cord tissue from male and female rodents and human organ donors. Analysis of single-cell/nuclei sequencing datasets revealed that the GluN2A (GRIN2A) and GluN2B (GRIN2B) subunits are robustly expressed in dorsal horn neurons of both mice and humans, with moderate expression of GluN2D (GRIN2D) and minimal expression of GluN2C (GRIN2C). Immunohistochemistry with antigen retrieval demonstrated that GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D proteins are all preferentially localized to the superficial dorsal horn of both adult rats and humans, which is conserved between males and females. Surprisingly, we found that these GluN2 NMDAR subunits are enriched in the lateral superficial dorsal horn for rats but not for humans, while presynaptic and neuronal markers are symmetrically distributed across the rat mediolateral axis. A dramatic shift in localization of GluN2A to the lateral superficial dorsal horn was observed across later postnatal development (PD21-PD90) in both male and female rats, with a corresponding change in synaptic NMDAR currents. This discovery of changes in NMDAR subunit distribution into rodent adulthood and between species will shed light on the physiological roles of NMDARs and their utility as potential therapeutic targets for pain.",

    "title": "Coupled rhythms in early auditory cortex mirror speech acoustics",
    "content": "Theta and gamma neural dynamics dominate the human auditory cortex during speech perception and have been proposed to track syllable boundaries and encode phonemic information, respectively. To what extent these rhythms engage intrinsic mechanisms or mirror the phase and frequency of the speech acoustics remains unsolved. Applying signal processing techniques from neuroscience to speech audio corpora from 17 languages, we found that canonical brain features (theta, gamma, and their phase-amplitude coupling) are distinctive and visible in the speech envelope. They represent syllabic rate (between 2 and 6 Hz), vocalic features (between 30 and 50 Hz), and fundamental frequency (between 100 and 150 Hz). Intracerebral (sEEG) recordings from the auditory cortex of 18 epilepsy patients revealed that theta-gamma dynamics and their coupling are absent at rest but emerge during speech perception, linearly driven by the acoustic envelope. These responses originate from distinct neural populations within overlapping auditory regions. Thus, theta-gamma auditory dynamics primarily mirror speech acoustics rather than being generated by endogenous mechanisms.",

    "title": "Canonical decision computations underlie behavioral and neural signatures of cooperation in primates",
    "content": "Successful cooperation requires dynamic integration of social cues. However, the neural mechanisms supporting this complex process remain unknown. Here, we reveal that the primate dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) implements a gaze-dependent social evidence accumulation process to guide cooperative decisions in freely moving marmoset dyads. A drift-diffusion process in which the partner's action variability is accumulated by social gaze best explains the cooperative actions of the actor. Single-neuron recordings in dmPFC revealed a direct neural correlate: the slope of predictive ramping activity mapped directly onto the rate of evidence accumulation, while baseline firing, modulated by prior outcomes, mapped onto the initial bias. At the population level, the geometry of dmPFC neural trajectories reflected the strength of social evidence and was linked to cooperative success. Together, these findings establish a multi-level neural mechanism for transforming active sensing into a decision variable, linking a canonical computation to cooperative behavior in a naturalistic setting.",

    "title": "Bridging Histology and Tractography: First Visualization of the Short-Range Prefrontal Connections in the Human Brain",
    "content": "Decades of histological research in non-human primates have revealed a dense web of short-range connections underpinning prefrontal cortex (PFC) function. However, translating this anatomical ground-truth to the living human brain has been a major challenge, leaving our understanding of the PFC's intrinsic wiring incomplete. These short-range fibers are difficult to resolve with non-invasive methods like diffusion tractography, which are often hampered by false positives. Here, we provide the first systematic in-vivo visualization of these pathways in the human brain. By guiding high-resolution probabilistic tractography with established histological findings, we mapped the short-range connections within and between five major PFC subdivisions in 1,003 individuals (547 F, 456 M). Our anatomically-guided approach successfully reconstructed these intricate connections with high precision (>80%) and accuracy (>70%) relative to histological findings. The resulting tracts not only captured broad organizational principles but also replicated fine-grained patterns previously only seen in invasive studies. Furthermore, these connections showed high test-retest reliability within individuals alongside significant variability between them, highlighting a stable yet unique anatomical fingerprint. Ultimately, this study shows how linking histology to tractography provides a powerful framework to advance our understanding of the human connectome and opens avenues to investigate local circuitry that underpins cognition and disease.",

    "title": "Individual Differences in Speech Monitoring: Functional and Structural Correlates of Delayed Auditory Feedback",
    "content": "Speech production relies on continuous self-monitoring to ensure that produced sounds match intended targets. Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) disrupts speech fluency by perturbing this alignment and offers a powerful tool to study the sensorimotor control of speech. Here, we combined functional and diffusion-weighted MRI in 31 participants producing words with and without DAF. Participants showed substantial variability in how much their speech slowed under DAF, quantified by a continuous susceptibility index (SI). At the group level, DAF elicited increased activation in a right-lateralized speech motor network encompassing the superior temporal, supramarginal, inferior frontal, precentral, and supplementary motor areas, along with engagement of the left cerebellum. In contrast, individual differences revealed the opposite pattern: higher susceptibility was associated with stronger activation in left-hemisphere speech motor homologues. Diffusion analyses of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) further showed that greater fiber density in the right posterior AF predicted lower susceptibility, whereas larger right long AF volume predicted higher susceptibility. Together, these findings identify a lateralized and tract-specific organization of speech monitoring: fluency under perturbation depends on a right-lateralized monitoring network that supports integration of auditory and somatosensory feedback through the right posterior AF, while stronger auditory-motor coupling via the right long AF and excessive left-hemisphere activation predict greater vulnerability to feedback disruption.",

    "content": "Planning in value-based decision making is often dynamic, with reinforcement learning (RL) providing a powerful framework for investigating how value and action at each step change across trials. Surprisingly, the evolving neural signatures of value estimation and state reactivation in multi-step planning, both within and across trials, have received little consideration. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we detail neural dynamics associated with planning, wherein subjects were tasked to find an optimal path in order to maximise reward. Behavioural evidence showed improved performance across trials, including subjects showing an increasing disregard for low-value states. MEG data captured evolving value estimation signals such that, across trials, there was an emergence of stronger and earlier within trial value encoding linked to boosted vmPFC activity. Value encoding signals showed a positive correlation and individual performance metrics, as reflected in overall task-related reward earnings. Strikingly, across trials, there was an attenuation of state reactivation for negative-value states, an effect that positively correlated with evolving negative-value state avoidance behaviour. The finding linking neural dynamics, including a valence-dependent selective reactivation of negative states, to across-trial behavioural improvement advances an understanding of learning during multi-step planning.",

    "content": "Perceptual decisions are biased by recent history, yet the balance between attractive and repulsive effects varies across contexts. Here, we tested whether trial by trial response expectations shape the direction of history biases in serial dependence during orientation reproduction. Behaviorally, we found that no response trials, especially when rare, reduced attractive biases and enhanced repulsive biases. EEG results revealed stronger evoked responses and amplified neural representations for stimuli following no-response trials. Together, these findings suggest that interrupting the perception action cycle fosters a state of re-engagement with current input and disengagement from past stimuli, indicating that serial dependence is a flexible process dynamically modulated by task expectations and transient shifts in sensory processing.",

    "content": "Neuronal migration is a vital process that positions billions of neurons to create a functional brain. To navigate the constrained microenvironments within the cortex, precise control over the nuclear mechanics in migrating neurons is indispensable. Here, we show that Lamin B1 (LB1) regulates neuronal migration by modulating nuclear deformability. Excess LB1 in neurons halted migration without altering laminar identity or overall gene expressions in vivo, while in vitro, it elevated nuclear stiffness and impaired neuronal motility in confined spaces. Moreover, mispositioned neurons resulted in electrophysiological defects in the brain. Computational modeling predicted a temporal relationship between nuclear deformation and enhanced migration velocity, which was validated experimentally through live imaging. Notably, cerebral organoid assays using iPS cells established from patients with LMNB1 duplication exhibited impaired neuronal migration in a human model. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that LB1 is a critical regulator of nuclear mechanics, ensuring the accurate spatiotemporal positioning of neurons.",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Objective. Analysis tools for peripheral nerve recordings remain underdeveloped compared to those for brain signals, limiting the advancement of nerve neurotechnologies for clinical treatments such as closed-loop systems. This study introduces and explores the performance of two novel nerve signal analysis techniques\u2014cross-correlation analysis and spike delay velocity analysis\u2014which rely on a defining feature of peripheral nerve signals: the reliable conduction velocity of signals transmitted by axons in nerves. Approach. We test the capabilities of the introduced cross-correlation and spike delay velocity analysis techniques both in silico on synthetic nerve signals and on in vivo nerve signals acquired from freely-moving rats. Main results. Our findings show that both techniques can be successfully employed to extract transmission direction and velocity information from compact two-electrode site peripheral nerve recording designs. Notably, cross-correlation analysis can be employed to detect neural signals of very low signal-to-noise ratio, otherwise undetectable by typical spike detection approaches. Significance. Our findings provide new techniques to both enhance detection and extract new information in the form of velocity data from nerve recordings using a compact two-electrode site recording setup. Unlike traditional methods, this design eliminates the need for long electrode arrays, making it particularly well-suited for use in freely-moving animal models and translational applications. As axon signal conduction direction and velocity are tightly linked to neural function, these techniques can support new research into peripheral nervous system function and new therapeutic approaches driven by neural interfaces.",

    "title": "BGTransform: a neurophysiologically informed EEG data augmentation framework",
    "content": "Objective. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for decoding electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) signals. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity and variability of available training data. Existing data augmentation methods often introduce signal distortions or lack physiological validity. This study proposes a novel augmentation strategy designed to improve generalization while preserving the underlying neurophysiological structure of EEG signals. Approach. We propose Background EEG Transform (BGTransform), a principled data augmentation framework that leverages the neurophysiological dissociation between task-related activity and ongoing background EEG. In contrast to existing methods, BGTransform generates new trials by selectively perturbing the background EEG component while preserving the task-related signal, thus enabling controlled variability without compromising class-discriminative features. We applied BGTransform to three publicly available EEG-BCI datasets spanning steady-state visual evoked potential and P300 paradigms. The effectiveness of BGTransform is evaluated using several widely adopted neural decoding models under three training regimes: (1) without augmentation (baseline model), (2) with conventional augmentation methods, and (3) with BGTransform. Main results. Across all datasets and model architectures, BGTransform consistently outperformed both baseline models and conventional augmentation techniques. Compared to models trained without BGTransform, it achieved average classification accuracy improvements of 2.45%\u201315.52%, 4.36%\u201317.15% and 7.55%\u201310.47% across the three datasets, respectively. In addition, BGTransform demonstrated greater robustness across subjects and tasks, maintaining stable performance under varying recording conditions. Significance. BGTransform provides a principled and effective approach to augmenting EEG data, informed by neurophysiological insight. By preserving task-related components and introducing controlled variability, the method addresses the challenge of data sparsity in EEG-BCI training. These findings support the utility of BGTransform for improving the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of deep learning models in neural engineering applications.",

    "content": "Objective. Brain\u2013machine interface (BMI) research has shown the efficacy of using motor and sensory-related neural signals to assist physically impaired patients. Despite the comparable ability to extract more abstract cognitive signals from the brain, little effort has been devoted to leveraging these signals in neuro-engineering applications. In this study, we explore the use of neural signals related to economic value, a key cognitive construct, in a BMI context. Approach. Using multivariate time series data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices in a value-based decision-making task. We implement a reinforcement learning-based training approach to develop adaptive decoders that can be extended to handle multi-step decisions, which frequently arise in real-world settings. Main results. We develop neural decoders leveraging subjective value signals to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices with accuracy on average, with above-chance accuracy even when choice options are objectively equal. We show that this same decoder architecture can be trained to execute choice-related actions and execute action sequences aligned with the user\u2019s goal. Finally, we explore a decoder architecture that uses a neural forecasting model equipped with task-related information, and show that it makes high accuracy predictions \u2009ms sooner than would otherwise be possible. Significance. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuro-engineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals to aid users in goal-directed behavior. They suggest that using abstract cognitive signals in real-world settings may be more accurate when combined with information from multiple sources, such as motor and sensory regions. This research also highlights the potential need for systems to measure their confidence in their actions when user input is minimal.",

    "content": "Objective. New implantable and wearable devices hold great promise to help patients manage their seizure disorders. One proposed application is measuring the rate of interictal epileptiform discharges as a biomarker of medication levels and seizure risk. This study aims to determine whether interictal epileptiform spike rates (spikes) are independently associated with anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels and evaluate whether spike rates are a reliable biomarker for ASM levels. Approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 69 patients with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring during ASM taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit. An automated spike detection algorithm, validated seizure annotations, and a model of ASM load were used to assess the relationship between spike rates, ASM level, state of consciousness, and seizure timing using linear mixed effects models. Event related analysis and seasonal autoregressive models were applied to evaluate both short-term and longer-term effects of ASMs on spike rates, respectively. Main Results. Spike rates were found to increase following seizures, during sleep, and in patients experiencing early seizures, with no significant association between ASM load and spike rates after controlling for these confounders. Initial models without controls showed a positive association between ASM load and spike rates. However, this relationship disappeared when the effects of sleep and seizures were accounted for. Medication-specific analysis revealed that only levetiracetam showed a significant impact on spike rates during taper. Significance. This study demonstrates that interictal spike rates are more strongly influenced by seizure activity and sleep than by ASM levels, suggesting limited utility of spike rates as a biomarker for ASM load. However, spikes may still serve as important markers for seizure control and disease severity.",

    "content": "Objective. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type subdural electrode array, to characterize its mechanical compatibility with neural tissue (i.e., the forces exerted onto the brain upon conformation) for chronic brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A full-factorial design of experiments was used to assess the effects of geometrical variations, orientation, and polymeric encapsulation on the stiffness of silicon-based Neuralace structures. A custom low-force four-point bending setup was developed to measure flexural stiffness in a physiologically relevant displacement range. Main results. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N m\u22121 to 7.21 N m\u22121, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, orientation, and parylene-C (PPXC) encapsulation. Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10\u2013100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the brain\u2019s topology (considering a 60 mm radius of the gyrus). Significance. Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. These arrays are now transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs, which requires consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study establishes a rigorous and reproducible framework for mechanical characterization of conformable neural implants and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning design parameters to reduce implant-induced mechanical stress on cortical tissue. The results support future development of chronic BCI-compatible subdural electrodes with improved biocompatibility through mechanical design.",

These patterns suggest that unemployment is associated with distinct alterations in dream content, reflecting reduced cognitive engagement and heightened preoccupation with occupational concerns.

The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares.

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

It's a Python library that brings a fluent, declarative, and 100% type-safe API for data manipulation, inspired by Rust Iterators and the style of libraries like Polars.</p> <p><strong>Installation</strong></p> <p><code>uv add pyochain</code></p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Source Code (GitHub):</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/pyochain\">https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/pyochain</a></li> <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://outsquarecapital.github.io/pyochain/\">https://outsquarecapital.github.io/pyochain/</a></li> <li><strong>Pypi</strong>: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pyochain/\">https://pypi.org/project/pyochain/</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>What my project does</strong></p> <p>It provides chainable, functional-style methods for standard Python data structures, with a rich collections of methods operating on lazy iterators for memory efficiency, an exhaustive documentation, and a complete, modern type coverage with generics and overloads to cover all uses cases.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a quick example to show the difference in styles with 3 different ways of doing it in python, and pyochain:</p> <pre><code>import pyochain as pc result_comp = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] result_func = list(map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10)))) result_loop: list[int] = [] for x in range(10): if x % 2 == 0: result_loop.append(x**2) result_pyochain = ( pc.Iter.from_(range(10)) # pyochain.Iter.__init__ only accept Iterator/Generators .filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0) # call python filter builtin .map(lambda x: x**2) # call python map builtin .collect() # convert into a Collection, by default list, and return a pyochain.Seq .unwrap() # return the underlying data ) assert ( result_comp == result_func == result_loop == result_pyochain == [0, 4, 16, 36, 64] ) </code></pre> <p>Obviously here the intention with the list comprehension is quite clear, and performance wise is the best you could do in pure python.</p> <p>However once it become more complex, it quickly becomes incomprehensible since you have to read it in a non-inuitive way:</p> <p>- the input is in the middle<br /> - the output on the left<br /> - the condition on the right<br /> (??)</p> <p>The functional way suffer of the other problem python has : nested functions calls .</p> <p>The order of reading it is.. well you can see it for yourself.</p> <p>All in all, data pipelines becomes quickly unreadable unless you are great at finding names or you write comments. Not funny.</p> <p>For my part, whem I started programming with python, I was mostly using pandas and numpy, so I was just obligated to cope with their bad API's.</p> <p>Then I discovered polars, it's fluent interface and my perspective shifted.<br /> Afterwards, when I tried some Rust for fun in another project, I was shocked to see how much easier it was to work with lazy Iterator with the plethora of methods available. See for yourself:</p> <p><a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html</a></p> <p>Now with pyochain, I only have to read my code from top to bottom, from left to right.</p> <p>If my lambda become too big, I can just isolate it in a function.<br /> I can then chain functions with pipe, apply, into on the same pipeline effortlessly, and I rarely have to implement data oriented classes besides NamedTuples, basic dataclasses, etc... since I can express high level manipulations already with pyochain.</p> <p>pyochain also implement a lot of functionnality for dicts (or convertible objects compliants to the Mapping Protocol).<br /> There are methods to work on all keys, values, etc... in a fast way thanks to cytoolz usage under the hood (a library implemented in Cython) with the same chaining style.<br /> But also methods to conveniently flatten the structure of a dict, extract it's &quot;schema&quot; (recursively find the datatypes inside), modify and select keys in nested structure thanks to an API inspired by polars with pyochain.key function who can create &quot;expressions&quot;.</p> <p>For example, pyochain.key(&quot;a&quot;).key(&quot;b&quot;).apply(lambda x: x + 1), when passed in a select or with fields context (pyochain.Dict.select, pyochain.Dict.with_fields), will extract the value, just like foo[&quot;a&quot;][&quot;b&quot;].</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This library is aimed at Python developers who enjoy method chaining/functionnal style, Rust Iterators API, python lazy Generators/Iterators, or, like me, data scientist who are enthusiast Polars users.</p> <p>It's intended for anyone who wants to make their data transformation code more readable and composable by using method chaining on any python object who adhere to the protocols defined in <a href=\"http://collections.abc\">collections.abc</a> who are Iterable, Iterator/Generator, Mapping, and Collection (meaning a LOT of use cases).</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>vs.</strong> <code>itertools/cytoolz</code>: Basically uses most of their functions under the hood. pyochain provides de facto type hints and documentation on all the methods used, by using stubs made by me that you can find here: <a href=\"https://github.com/py-stubs/cytoolz-stubs\">https://github.com/py-stubs/cytoolz-stubs</a></li> <li><strong>vs.</strong> <code>more-itertools</code>: Like <code>itertools</code>, <code>more-itertools</code> offers a great collection of utility functions, and pyochain uses some of them when needed or when cytoolz doesn't implement them (the latter is prefered due to performance).</li> <li>vs <code>pyfunctional</code>: this is a library that I didn't knew of when I first started writing pyochain. pyfunctional provides the same paradigm (method chaining), parallel execution, and IO operations, however it provides no typing at all (vs 100% coverage of pyochain), and it has a redundant API (multiples ways of doing the exact same thing, filer and where methods for example).</li> <li><strong>vs.</strong> <code>polars</code>: <code>pyochain</code> is <strong>not</strong> a DataFrame library. It's for working with <em>standard Python iterables and dictionaries</em>. It borrows the <em>style</em> of polars APIs but applies it to everyday data structures. It allows to work with non tabular data for pre-processing it before passing it in a dataframe(e.g deeply nested JSON data), OR to conveniently works with expressions, for example by calling methods on all the expressions of a context, or generating expressions in a more flexible way than polars.selectors, all whilst keeping the same style as polars (no more ugly for loops inside a beautiful polars pipeline). Both of those are things that I use a lot in my own projects.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Performance consideration</strong></p> <p>There's no miracle, pyochain will be slower than native for loops. This is is simply due to the fact that pyochain need to generate wrapper objects, call methods, etc....<br /> However the bulk of the work won't be really impacted (the loop in itself), and tbh if function call /object instanciation overhead is a bottleneck for you, well you shouldn't be using python in the first place IMO.</p> <p><strong>Future evolution</strong></p> <p>To me this library is still far from finished, there's a lot of potential for improvements, namely performance wise.<br /> Namely reimplementing all functions of itertools and pyochain closures in Rust (if I can figure out how to create Generators in Pyo3) or in Cython.</p> <p>Also, in the past I implemented a JIT Inliner, consisting of an AST parser that was reading my list of function calls (each pyochain object method was adding a function to a list, instead of calling it on the underlying data immediatly, so double lazy in a way) and was creating on the fly python code that was &quot;optimized&quot;, meaning that that the code generated was inlined (no more func(func(func())) nested calls) and hence avoided all the function overhead calls.</p> <p>Then, I went further ahead and improved that by generating on the fly cython code from this optimized python code who was then compiled. To avoid costly recompilation at each run I managed a physical cache, etc...</p> <p>Inlining, JIT Cython compilation, + the fact that my main classes were living in cython code (hence instanciation and calls cost were far cheaper), allowed my code to match or even beat optimized python loops on arbitrary objects.</p> <p>But the code was becoming messy and added a lot of complexity so I abandonned the idea, it can still be found here however, and could be reimplemented I'm sure:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/pyochain/commit/a7c2d80cf189f0b6d29643ccabba255477047088\">https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/pyochain/commit/a7c2d80cf189f0b6d29643ccabba255477047088</a></p> <p>I also need to take a decision regarding the pychain.key function. Should I ditch it completely? should I keep it as simple as possible? Should I go back how I designed it originally and implement it in a manner as complete as possible? idk yet.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>I learned a lot and had a lot of fun (well except when dealing with Sphinx, then Pydocs, then Mkdocs, etc... when I was trying to generate the documentation from docstrings) when writing this library.</p> <p>This is my first package published on Pypi!</p> <p>All questions and feedback are welcome.</p> <p>I'm particularly interested in discussing software design, would love to have others perspectives on my implementation (mixins by modules to avoid monolithic files whilst still maintaining a flat API for end user)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beginning-Fruit-1397\"> /u/Beginning-Fruit-1397 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oe4n7h/pyochain_method_chaining_on_iterators_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oe4n7h/pyochain_method_chaining_on_iterators_and/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
    "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

    "content": "<p>Action control is hypothesized to be mediated by corticothalamo-basal ganglia loops subserving the acquisition and updating of action contingencies. Within this, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is thought to contribute to volitional control over behavior largely through its interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, MD also projects into striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the contribution of such projections to behavioral control is not known. Using a mouse model of volitional action control in either sex, here we find that MD terminal calcium activity in dorsal medial striatum (MD-&gt;DMS) represents action information during initial acquisition of a novel action contingency. This representation of action information decreases with continued experience. Data demonstrate MD-&gt;DMS activity is necessary to learn and employ a contingency control over actions. Functional attenuation of MD-&gt;DMS activity negated normal exploration, instead biasing repetitive action control, and resulted in mice unable to adapt their initial action strategy upon changes in action contingency. This suggests MD supports plasticity underlying initial action strategy learning used to adjust control given changing contingencies. Overall, these data show that MD projections into striatum contribute to volitional action control that supports acquisition of adaptive behavior.</p>",

    "content": "<p>At the glutamatergic synapses between rod photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (BCs), neurotransmitter is detected by the postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6. This receptor forms trans-synaptic interactions with ELFN1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule expressed in rods, and ELFN1 is important for mGluR6 localization at BC dendritic tips. Here, we show that in mice of either sex lacking mGluR6, the presynaptic localization of ELFN1 is disrupted. In rods of mGluR6 null mice, ELFN1 is still restricted to the axon terminal spherules but is only partially colocalized with synapses. The ELFN1 localization defect is rescued by expressing mGluR6-EGFP in ON-BCs. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and LRR C-terminal cap (LRRCT) regions of the ELFN1 extracellular domain (ECD) are necessary and sufficient for binding to all of the Group 3 mGluRs, including mGluR6. ELFN1-flag expressed in rods of wild-type mice is correctly localized at presynapses, colocalizing with the postsynaptic marker TRPM1 in the outer plexiform layer. Deletion of the LRRCT domain abolished trafficking of ELFN1-flag to rod spherules, whereas deletion of other parts of the ELFN1 ECD did not prevent axonal trafficking or correct presynaptic localization. Our results demonstrate bidirectional mutual regulation of presynaptic enrichment of ELFN1 and postsynaptic enrichment of mGluR6 at photoreceptor synapses.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) integrates subcortical signals related to arousal, stress, addiction, and anxiety with top-down cortical influences. Increases or decreases in PVT activity exert profound, long-lasting effects on behavior related to motivation, addiction, and homeostasis. Yet the sources of its subcortical excitatory and inhibitory afferents, their distribution within the PVT, and their integration with layer-specific cortical inputs remain unclear. Using transgenic male and female mice selective for GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, or for different cortical layers, we found that the input organization of PVT is unique among thalamic nuclei. PVT received subcortical GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs from multiple, distinct hypothalamic and brainstem regions. Most regions provided either excitatory or inhibitory afferents; however, subcortical inputs with dual components have also been found. Most of these subcortical inputs selectively targeted the core region of the PVT that contained large number of densely packed calretinin-positive (CR+) neurons. Cortical afferents to PVT displayed layer-specific segregation. Layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex preferentially innervated the CR+ core, whereas layer 6 input was more abundant in the transition zone between PVT and the mediodorsal nucleus. These findings demonstrate extensive convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from diverse subcortical sources, selectively, in a sharply delineated CR+ core region of PVT which is also under strong top-down control from layer 5. This unique organization may explain why the CR+ PVT core serves as a critical bottleneck in the subcortex&ndash;cortex communication involved in affective behavior.</p>",

    "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
    "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

By comparing the expression profiles of injured peripheral and central nerves in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice, we identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) as a key regulator that determines the differences in myelin breakdown between the injured PNS and CNS. Schwann cell-derived IGFBP2 in the injured PNS promotes myelin breakdown and facilitates axonal regeneration. Furthermore, through lipidomics, we identify ceramide, a sphingolipid regulated by ceramide synthase 6 in injured nerves, as playing a critical role in IGFBP2-mediated myelin breakdown. Conversely, minimal IGFBP2 expression is observed in the injured CNS, contributing to the limited myelin breakdown and axon regeneration in injured CNS. These findings provide insights into the divergent regenerative potential of the PNS and CNS and unveil IGFBP2 and ceramide as promising targets for promoting CNS regeneration after injury.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination codons (PTCs) and fine-tunes gene expression by targeting RNA transcripts with other NMD inducing features. This study demonstrates that conditional knock-out of <i>Smg5</i>, a key NMD component, in oligodendrocyte lineage cells disrupts the degradation of PTC-containing transcripts, including aberrant variants of the RNA-binding protein <i>Hnrnpl</i>. The loss of SMG5 in both sexes of mice impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation, reduced myelin gene expression, and led to thinner myelin sheaths and compromised motor function in mice. Mechanistically, HNRNPL was shown to regulate the alternative splicing of myelin-associated genes <i>Mag</i> and <i>Nfasc</i> and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. These findings reveal that SMG5-mediated NMD ensures RNA processing fidelity essential for proper oligodendrocyte development and CNS myelination.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are complex phenomena governed by genetics, neurophysiology, environment, and societal structures. New methods to understand the underlying neurogenetics are valuable for designing personalized interventional strategies. Here, we used a two-choice self-administration zebrafish assay to isolate the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha3 (<i>chrna3</i>) in alcohol response. Juvenile zebrafish, of either sex, prior to complete sex differentiation, were examined in this study. They exhibited a biphasic response when self-administering alcohol that transitioned from attraction to aversion within minutes, suggesting they can regulate exposure to alcohol. This inverted U-shaped self-administration mirrored the effect alcohol has on shoaling behavior. Exposure to low concentration of alcohol reduced anxiety-like behaviors, while sedative effects became prominent at higher concentrations resulting in reduced locomotion and uncoordinated swimming. In contrast, these responses are blunted in <i>chrna3</i> mutants. They exhibited prolonged alcohol self-administration and increased gregariousness. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission alongside cholinergic signaling is impacted in the mutant brains. Our results thus suggest that <i>chrna3</i> dysfunction has a systemic change with an increase in alcohol tolerance being one effect. These findings also highlight the use of nonrodent alternatives to understand the neurogenetics of development of AUD.</p>",

    "title": "Involvement of the Endothelial N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor on Vessel-Associated Positioning and Differentiation of Cortical Oligodendrocytes and on Motor Activity",
    "content": "<p>During cortical development, oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) attachment and detachment to microvessels play a crucial role in their positioning and differentiation. In the developing brain, endothelial cells are regionally diverse, and previous studies showed a peak in cortical endothelial NMDA receptor (eNMDAR) expression during perinatal life, coinciding with OPC migration along microvessels. This raises the hypothesis that eNMDAR might influence the fate of vessel-associated OPC. In this study, a Grin1<sup>lox/lox</sup>/VeCad<sup>Cre</sup> mouse model was used to investigate in females and males the effects of endothelial GluN1 invalidation (eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) on (1) positioning and differentiation of cortical oligodendrocytes and myelination, (2) OPC/microvessel association and endothelial MMP9-like activity, and (3) motor activity. Results showed that, from postnatal days (P) 2 to P15, PDGFR&alpha; expression was increased in eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice and returned to wild-type levels by P45. CNPase and MBP expression was reduced at P15 and remained low in adult eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Histological analysis revealed no change in OPC&ndash;microvessel association, but positioning was altered with increased density in layers VI and V at P15. Myelination was impaired, as evidenced by thinner corpus callosum, reduced myelin sheath thickness, and higher g-ratio. Axonal mitochondria density was significantly increased. Functional tests revealed that glutamate could not stimulate endothelial MMP9-like activity in eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Molecular, histological and functional changes were linked to sensorimotor disabilities. At P45, despite the absence of observable myelination defects, locomotor impairments persisted, suggesting that early OPC differentiation disruption contributes to lasting motor dysfunction. These findings offer new insights into OPC vulnerability in human preterm infants.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate how Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates glial phenotype, neuroprotection, and reprogramming of Mu&#x0308;ller glia (MG) into neurogenic MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the adult male and female mouse retina. We found that S1P-related genes were dynamically regulated following retinal damage. <i>S1pr1</i> (S1P receptor 1) and <i>Sphk1</i> (sphingosine kinase 1) are expressed at low levels by resting MG and are rapidly upregulated following acute damage. Overexpression of the neurogenic bHLH transcription factor Ascl1 in MG downregulates <i>S1pr1</i>, and inhibition of Sphk1 and S1pr1/3 enhances Ascl1-driven differentiation of bipolar-like cells. Treatments that activate S1pr1 or increase retinal levels of S1P initiate proinflammatory NFB signaling in MG, whereas treatments that inhibit S1pr1 or decreased levels of S1P suppress NFB signaling in MG. Conditional knock-out (cKO) of <i>S1pr1</i> in MG, but not <i>Sphk1</i>, enhances the accumulation of immune cells in damaged retinas. cKO of <i>S1pr1</i> promotes the survival of ganglion cells, whereas cKO of <i>Sphk1</i> promotes the survival amacrine cells in damaged retinas. Consistent with these findings, pharmacological treatments that inhibit S1P receptors or inhibit Sphk1 have protective effects upon inner retinal neurons. We conclude that the S1P signaling pathway is activated in MG after damage and this pathway restricts the accumulation of immune cells, impairs neuron survival, and suppresses the reprogramming of MG into neurogenic progenitors in the adult mouse retina.</p>",

    "content": "<p>People are remarkably self-focused, disproportionately choosing to think about themselves relative to other topics. Self-focus can be adaptive, helping individuals fulfill their needs. It can also be maladaptive, with self-focus a risk and maintenance factor for internalizing disorders like depression. Yet, the drive to focus on the self remains to be fully characterized. We discovered a brain pattern that when spontaneously brought online during a quick mental break predicts the desire to focus on oneself just a few seconds later. In Study 1 (19 female and 13 male human subjects), we identified a default network neural signature from pr-trial activity that predicts multiple indicators of self-focus within our sample. In Study 2 (588 female and 498 male human subjects), we applied our neural signature to independent resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project. We found that individuals who score high on internalizing, a form of maladaptive self-focus, similarly move in and out of this pattern during rest, suggesting a systematic trajectory toward self-focused thought. This is the first work to \"decode\" the bias to focus on the self and paves the way toward stopping maladaptive self-focus in its course.</p>",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

Working memory (WM) was assessed via a delayed-match-to-sample task (accuracy and sensitivity index d\u2019).ResultsCompared to Sham, the tACS group showed significant WM accuracy improvement (p < 0.05). AM-tACS exhibited a smaller but statistically significant enhancement in d\u2019 (p < 0.05).

    "content": "ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to look into the brain functional network changes and their possible correlations with clinical traits, spontaneous arm movements, and recovery in middle cerebral artery stroke.MethodsThe study included 34 patients with acute cerebral infarction (CI) at middle artery and upper limb dyskinesia, as well as 50 healthy control (HC) participants. The spontaneous activity data of both upper limbs were recorded using a wrist activity recorder for 24\u202fh. The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scales were then completed 90\u202fdays after the stroke onset. Resting-state EEG was acquired from both the CI and HC groups, and brain network features were examined using the microstate analysis. The correlations between microstates, spontaneous activity and clinical traits were investigated.ResultsCompared with the HC group, the CI group had a higher MsB duration, lower MsC coverage and occurrence, and a decrease in both MsA and MsB to MsC as well as a decrease in MsC to MsA (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); only the transition from MsC to MsB was enhanced; Reduced MsD coverage, occurrence, and duration when patients had larger FMA scores (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); The MsB to MsA and MsD significantly correlated with FMA. Moreover, we found increased MsC coverage and duration, as well as the transition rates of MsA and MsD to MsC in those patients with mRS scores larger than one at 90\u202fdays after stroke (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Parts of Ms parameters involving MsA significantly correlated with mRS at 90\u202fdays after stroke.ConclusionThe dynamic balance of brain networks is altered when cerebral infarction occurs, and microstates offer a portion of the functional brain network foundation that allows us to recognize these alterations. These changes in temporal dynamic parameters effectively suggest the clinical traits and functional recovery in CI.",

    "content": "IntroductionAerobic exercise mitigates symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and may slow disease progression; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these improvements are not well understood. In this study, we discuss the methodology for simultaneously recording local field potentials (LFP) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN), cortical activity using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), and exercise performance metrics during a 40-min aerobic cycling session. Data from a single patient with PD are presented to illustrate the utility, feasibility, and data integrity of the experimental set up.MethodsThe Medtronic Percept\u2122 DBS system was used to record and stream bilateral STN-LFP in the OFF-therapy condition (OFF-DBS and OFF-antiparkinson medications) during a 40-min aerobic exercise session. A 64-channel mobile EEG system recorded cortical data. The neural data streams were synchronized using a TENS device that injected a specified electrical signal into the EEG and LFP recordings. Exercise performance metrics, heart rate, cadence, and power were synchronized with neural data and collected during the exercise session. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, trial identifying numbers NCT05905302 and NCT05972759.ResultsSTN-LFP, EEG, and exercise performance data can be synchronized, recorded for more than 40\u202fmin, and analyzed to evaluate how aerobic exercise impacts patterns of cortical and subcortical neural activity.ConclusionWhile exercise positively affects symptoms of PD, the precise effects of exercise on network activity remain unclear. The methods utilized for collecting and analyzing neural (cortical and subcortical) and exercise-related data during a typical bout of aerobic exercise suggest that this approach can be adopted for larger, long-term exercise studies in patients with PD and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The described protocol provides a roadmap for future projects aiming to combine STN-LFP and cortical data to better understand how exercise may alter cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic dynamics in PD.",

The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

    "title": "Early contingency information enhances human punishment sensitivity when punishment is frequent but not rare.",
    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "title": "Deep brain stimulation of nucleus basalis of meynert: Effect of stimulation mode and duration on learning in rat model of dementia.",
    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

Lots of manual searching, opening windows & tabs, scrolling, and ultimately copying & pasting into a document editor.<p>Surf is a desktop app meant for simultaneous research and thinking to minimize the grunt work. It\u2019s made of two parts:<p>1) A multi-media library where you can save and organize files and webpages into collections called Notebooks.<p>2) A LLM-powered smart document which you can auto-generate using the context from any stored page, tab or entire notebook. This document contains deep links back to the source material \u2014 like a page of a PDF or timestamp in a YouTube video. Unlike Deep Research products (or NotebookLMs chat) the entire thing is editable. The user also stays in the loop.<p>With a technology like AI, context / data is proving to be king. We think it should stay under the user\u2019s control, with minimal lock in: where you can own & export, and plug & play with different models. That\u2019s why Surf is:<p>- Open Source on GitHub\n- Open (& Local Data): the data saved in Surf is stored on your local machine in open and accessible formats and mostly works offline.\n- Open Model Choice: you can choose which models you use with Surf, and can add custom & Local LLMs<p>Early users include students & researchers who are learning and doing thematic research using Surf.<p>Github repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/deta/surf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/deta/surf/</a><p>Website: <a href=\"https://deta.surf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://deta.surf/</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45680937\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45680937</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "title": "DYRK1A in the physiology and pathology of the neuron-astrocyte axis",
    "content": "Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is a dosage-sensitive kinase with critical roles in the neuron-astrocyte axis. During brain development, DYRK1A ensures the proper number of differentiated neurons and astrocytes. In neurons, this DYRK1A regulates neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission. However, its functions in astrocytes are not yet well defined, with limited evidence indicating roles in astrocyte reactivity and excitotoxicity. Due to trisomy 21, DYRK1A is overexpressed in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). This imbalance directly contributes to neuronal death and likely astrocyte pathology, accelerating the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) in this population. Notably, DYRK1A overexpression also correlates with neurodegeneration and AD progression in elderly euploid adults. This correlation positions DYRK1A as a potential bridge between DS and AD, mechanistically connecting gene overdosage and neuropathology in both conditions. However, research on DYRK1A pathophysiology has primarily centered on neurons, leaving astrocytes largely understudied. Considering the vital neuroprotective functions of astrocytes, broadening DYRK1A research to encompass these cells presents an opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms contributing to the neurodegenerative process in AD. In this review, we highlight the physiology and pathology of DYRK1A in the neuron\u2013astrocyte axis, analyzing its roles in neurons and positing hypothetical functions in astrocytes, with particular emphasis on the contribution of DYRK1A\u2019s cell-specific overexpression to neurodegeneration and AD progression.",

    "title": "Identification of modulated whole-brain dynamical models from nonstationary electrophysiological data",
    "content": "Objective. Understanding the mechanisms underlying brain dynamics is a long-held goal in neuroscience. However, these dynamics are both individualized and nonstationary, making modeling challenging. Here, we present a data-driven approach to modeling nonstationary dynamics based on principles of neuromodulation, at the level of individual subjects. Approach. Previously, we developed the mesoscale individualized neural dynamics (MINDy) modeling approach to capture individualized brain dynamics which do not change over time. Here, we extend the MINDy approach by adding a modulatory component which is multiplied by a set of baseline, stationary connectivity weights. We validate this model on both synthetic data and publicly available electroencephalography data in the context of anesthesia, a known modulator of neural dynamics. Main results. We find that our modulated MINDy approach is accurate, individualized, and reliable. Additionally, we find that our models yield biologically interpretable inferences regarding the effects of propofol anesthesia on mesoscale cortical networks, consistent with previous literature on the neuromodulatory effects of propofol. Significance. Ultimately, our data-driven modeling approach is reliable and scalable, and provides insight into mechanisms underlying observed brain dynamics. Our modeling methodology can be used to infer insights about modulation dynamics in the brain in a number of different contexts.",

    "title": "Brain-to-text decoding with context-aware neural representations and large language models",
    "content": "Objective. Decoding attempted speech from neural activity offers a promising avenue for restoring communication abilities in individuals with speech impairments. Previous studies have focused on mapping neural activity to text using phonemes as the intermediate target. While successful, decoding neural activity directly to phonemes ignores the context dependent nature of the neural activity-to-phoneme mapping in the brain, leading to suboptimal decoding performance. Approach. In this work, we propose the use of diphone\u2014an acoustic representation that captures the transitions between two phonemes\u2014as the context-aware modeling target. We integrate diphones into existing phoneme decoding frameworks through a novel divide-and-conquer strategy in which we model the phoneme distribution by marginalizing over the diphone distribution. Our approach effectively leverages the enhanced context-aware representation of diphones while preserving the manageable class size of phonemes, a key factor in simplifying the subsequent phoneme-to-text conversion task. Main results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Brain-to-Text 2024 benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art phoneme error rate (PER) of 15.34% compared to 16.62% PER of monophone-based decoding. When coupled with finetuned large language models (LLMs), our method yields a Word error rate (WER) of 5.77%, significantly outperforming the 8.93% WER of the leading method in the benchmark. Significance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging context-aware neural representations and LLMs for brain-to-text decoding, thereby expanding the capabilities of speech neuroprostheses and paving the way toward restoring communication in individuals with speech impairments.",

Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",
