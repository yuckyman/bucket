    "title": "Acute electrical neuromodulation paradigms restore firing behavior and inhibition in secondary brain injury: A computational study.",
    "content": "Secondary Brain Injury (SBI) occurs after the initial physical insult caused due to traumatic brain injuries and strokes. SBI leads to a massive loss of brain functionalities if timely intervention is not administered. This work analyses the delineated effects of three acute SBI processes in two-neuron motifs and shows that the right stimulation paradigm during specific key SBI events help restore firing rate trends in neurons. The Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is extended to theoretically model two categories of two-neuron motifs: a feedforward excitatory motif (Motif 1: Two pyramidal neurons with glutamatergic synapses) and a feedforward inhibitory motif (Motif 2: One pyramidal neuron and one interneuron with GABAergic synapses). Three important SBI processes in the motifs were modeled: glutamate excitotoxicity, increased extracellular potassium ion concentration, and cellular energy deficit. Firing rate trend analysis is performed for increasing severity of SBI processes, and interesting points (key events) are identified. A wide range of ACS and DBS stimulation parameters are applied to the motifs during these key events to assess the firing rate response during stimulation. Increasing SBI severity caused an overall increase in excitation, synchronizing neuronal activities in Motif 1 and reducing inhibition in Motif 2. Alternate current stimulation paradigms were found to desynchronize and regulate neuronal firing in Motif 1. Deep brain stimulation parameters were found to increase inhibition in Motif 2, thereby helping to maintain the excitation-inhibition balance. The right stimulation paradigm administered at appropriate key events helps regulate neuronal firing, thereby reducing the metabolic burden on the neurons during acute SBI.",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems.

    "content": "Neuromodulatory systems regulate neural circuits across broad regions of the brain, and disruption of the dopaminergic system contributes to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Engineered viral vectors have been used to target the neuromodulatory systems of the nonhuman primate brain (Y. Chen et al., 2023; El-Shamayleh et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2010; Lerchner et al., 2014; Perez et al., 2022). However, a conspicuous obstacle to the isolation and modulation of specific pathways is the inability of many retrogradely infecting viruses to transduce dopaminergic (DA) cells efficiently (Tervo et al., 2016; Cushnie et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2020). We compare the DA neuron retrograde transduction efficacy of four viral vectors after injection into the striatum of nonhuman primates (NHP). Selectivity was assessed by comparing the neuronal co-expression of fluorescent reporter protein and tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) antibody in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The rabies pseudotyped lentiviral vector, FuG-B2, produced superior retrograde transduction of DA cells to FuG-C or FuG-E. AAV2.retro was the least effective.",

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia. Despite over a century of research, AD remains untreatable due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. While amyloid beta has dominated therapeutic efforts, tau pathology and neuroinflammation represent critical disease drivers and intriguing therapeutic targets. We developed an extended computational model building upon the open-source Aggregation Network Diffusion (AND) framework by coupling spatial tau propagation and aggregation with ordinary differential equations representing key inflammatory cascades. The model incorporates M1/M2 microglia and astrocytic activation, cytokine-mediated feedback loops, and neuronal loss, all modulated via region-specific genetic expression matrices of ApoE and TREM2 with variant-specific weighting. The model maintains biologically plausible tau dynamics while generating robust inflammatory marker trends, serving as a computational testbed for hypothesis generation and mechanistic exploration. The inflammatory components independently capture experimental observations and display a marked M1/M2 microglia divergence. The model demonstrates enhanced similarity to regional tau propagation patterns due to inflammatory and genetic components, reinforcing neuroinflammation's role in tau spread and highlighting the need to incorporate these processes in modeling efforts. Finally, through parsimony analysis, we identify microglia and pro-inflammatory rates (including microglia-facilitated tau spread) as key contributors to improved model accuracy, informing future modeling approaches.",

    "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding?

In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size.

    "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
    "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

    "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

    "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot.

In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "A pretrained foundation model for headache disorders based on magnetoencephalography",
    "content": "Objective. Foundation models have demonstrated transformative potential in medical artificial intelligence but remain underexplored in functional neuroimaging, particularly magnetoencephalography (MEG). This study aims to develop a domain-specific, self-supervised MEG clinical foundation model tailored for headache disorders to address the challenges of high-dimensional data and limited labeled datasets in clinical research. Approach. We developed a transformer-based model pretrained on a large-scale dataset comprising multi-state MEG recordings (resting-state, auditory, and somatosensory stimulation) from 416 participants (362 headache patients and 54 healthy controls). The model utilized a self-supervised masked-signal reconstruction strategy to learn latent spatiotemporal representations of neural activity. We evaluated the model\u2019s performance through signal reconstruction, visualization of attention weights, and downstream classification tasks comparing model-derived features against original MEG signals for migraine diagnosis. Main results. The pretrained model successfully reconstructed both continuous MEG signals and stimulus-specific evoked responses, effectively capturing intrinsic spatiotemporal brain dynamics. Visualization of the model\u2019s attention weights demonstrated spatial alignment with corresponding sensory brain regions, confirming its neurophysiological interpretability. Furthermore, classifiers trained on features extracted from the pretrained model significantly outperformed those using original MEG signals in identifying migraine patients, revealing distinct neural response patterns. Significance. This study introduces a scalable, data-efficient framework for clinical MEG analysis that significantly reduces reliance on manual feature extraction and labeled data. It demonstrates the efficacy of foundation models in decoding complex neural dynamics, offering promising implications for understanding neuropathology and facilitating precision diagnostics in neurology.",

    "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions.

    "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

This can be done in unit tests with things like Cachegrind/Callgrind, which simulate a CPU very minimally, and therefore can give you CPU instruction counts that are consistent across machines. And then combine that with snapshot testing and some wiggle room to take noise (e.g. from Python randomized hash seed) into account. Hope to write an article about this too eventually.</li> <li>The downside of the second approach is that it won't tell you about performance improvements or regressions that rely on CPU functionality like instruction-level parallelism. This is mostly irrelevant to pure Python code, but can come up with compiled Python extensions. This requires more elaborate setups because you're starting to rely on CPU features and different models are different. The simplest way I know of is in a PR: on a single machine (or GitHub Action run), run a benchmark in on `main`, run it on your branch, compare the difference.</li> </ol> <p>Any other ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/itamarst\"> /u/itamarst </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6q9hj/unit_testing_the_performance_of_your_code/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6q9hj/unit_testing_the_performance_of_your_code/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Prolonged esports play can induce cognitive fatigue by placing sustained demands on executive control, decision-making, and stress regulation. Since the brain relies primarily on glucose as an immediate energy source, we hypothesized that a carbohydrate gel designed to prolong post-ingestion glycaemia stabilizes interstitial glucose, attenuates hunger and cognitive fatigue, and helps preserve performance during extended esports play. Eleven healthy young men completed a randomized, double-blind crossover study with two sessions in which they ingested one of two carbohydrate gels matched for total energy and total carbohydrate but differing in carbohydrate composition (high-fructose corn syrup [HFCS]-dominant vs maltodextrin [MDX]-dominant) before gameplay. Interstitial glucose was monitored continuously, while hunger, salivary cortisol, pupil diameter, executive function, and in-game performance were assessed repeatedly. Compared with the control (HFCS-dominant) condition, the glycaemia-prolonging formulation maintained higher interstitial glucose levels during the later phase of gameplay, blunted the progressive increase in hunger, and attenuated cortisol responses. These physiological and subjective advantages were accompanied by better executive control and more adaptive defensive behaviors in-game, including fewer fouls and more interceptions. In contrast, pupil diameter, an index of global arousal, remained unchanged across conditions, suggesting that benefits were not driven by altered arousal but by improved glycaemic stability and appetite regulation. These findings indicate that a carbohydrate formulation that prolongs glycaemia can reduce hunger-linked cognitive fatigue and support task-relevant behavior during prolonged esports play. This low-burden nutritional strategy may help sustain mental performance during prolonged digital activities that impose high cognitive demands.",

    "title": "Neuropacify: a method to transform and match a patient\u2019s intracranial EEG to their NeuroPace RNS system data",
    "content": "Objective. Closed-loop responsive neurostimulators, such as the NeuroPace responsive neurostimulation (RNS) system, continuously monitor brain activity and deliver electrical stimulation in response to abnormal electrographic activity in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Practical technical constraints limit the temporal resolution of these devices, reducing the quality of EEG recordings. Approach. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to convert high-resolution intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) obtained from inpatient monitoring into the same format, parameters, and resolution produced by the RNS system, allowing direct comparison of iEEG with RNS system data. We validated this technique using data from patients who had both iEEG and RNS. Electrodes from the iEEG and RNS system were co-registered onto the same 3D coordinate grid, and vector math was applied to determine the iEEG electrodes closest to the operational RNS electrodes. Main results. Through spectral analysis, we derived a transfer function that accounts for all filtering and data processing produced by the RNS system. Comparison of the recorded data using visual and spectral analysis from iEEG and RNS confirmed that EEG characteristics were correctly transformed by the filtering function, allowing analysis of how iEEG signals would appear within the RNS system. We demonstrate two examples from the extreme edges of the spectra, showing how DC shifts and high frequency oscillations would be transformed by the RNS. We provide a tutorial to tune this method to local device parameters, a process that can be applied to other devices as well. Significance. This tool allows researchers and clinicians to extract EEG biomarkers from high-resolution iEEG and determine if/how they can be detected in lower-resolution RNS. This provides an opportunity to develop patient-specific seizure detection parameters and investigate the long-term effects of neurostimulation therapy.",

    "title": "Modular presynaptic assemblages scale to postsynaptic partner number",
    "content": "Behavioral diversification can arise through, and is constrained by, evolutionary and inter-individual differences in neural circuit development. Moreover, alteration of focal neural parameters changes the environment in which cells connect into circuits. In the mushroom body, an associative learning center of arthropods, the number of principal Kenyon cells varies widely across species and among individuals. How such variation is developmentally accommodated by projection neurons, which provide sensory input to Kenyon cells, is not understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, we previously demonstrated that projection neurons scale their presynaptic bouton number to Kenyon cell population size. Here, we identify the developmental mechanisms underlying this input flexibility. Boutons arise from projection neuron axonal collaterals; we find that a projection neuron's collateral number is subtype-specific and serves as the substrate through which bouton number scales to Kenyon cell population size. Independent of projection neuron identity or Kenyon cell number, individual collaterals most often produce just one bouton, suggesting collaterals are modular cell biological bouton units. Developing projection neurons initially overproduce nascent collaterals in the early pupa. The set of nascent collaterals that mature and eventually bear boutons is conditional on Kenyon cell number, thereby executing scaling. Finally, early boutons bear filopodia that frequently contact neighboring projection neuron processes, suggesting that bouton-bouton interactions contribute to shaping these structures.",

    "title": "The modular nature of long-association pathways in the human brain",
    "content": "Human brain functions are organized within large-scale networks, yet the long-range structural pathways that support them remain only partly understood. Diffusion MRI tractography has enabled non-invasive mapping of these connections but its low resolution has also contributed to a view of white matter association bundles as monolithic entities linking distant cortical regions. This contrasts with anatomical studies in non-human primates and humans, which show these bundles act as conduits for complex systems of short- and long-range projections. Here we investigate the dorsal branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF-I), the proposed structural backbone of the dorsal attention network, whose anatomy in humans is debated. Using anatomic tracing, polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography, and in vivo and ex vivo diffusion MRI, we reconstruct the SLF-I across species, modalities, and scales. High resolution tractography (<750 m), consistent with tracer and PS-OCT data, reveals multiple fiber systems of varying lengths rather than uniform parieto-frontal connections observed at more conventional resolution (1.5 mm). Comparative analyses show a consistent organization: the SLF-I carries short-range cortico-cortical projections rostral to area 6 and longer, layered connections extending to parietal regions, while direct parieto-frontal connectivity is mostly supported by the adjacent cingulum bundle. These findings reconcile our understanding of the SLF-I across the scales of non-invasive neuroimaging and invasive anatomic studies and provide an updated framework for future investigations of large-scale networks in health and disease.",

    "title": "Temporal order of activations and interactions during arithmetic calculations measured by intracranial electrophysiological recordings in the human brain",
    "content": "Arithmetic requires complex and fast processes orchestrated within a large-scale network spanning multiple brain regions. However, reports on the network's temporal dynamics are scarce. Here, we present data from intracranial EEG (iEEG) of 20 subjects (epilepsy surgery candidates) performing a sequential three-operand arithmetic task. Utilizing the high temporal and spatial resolution of iEEG, we analysed changes in high-gamma band (HGB; 52-120 Hz) activity and functional connectivity assessed by phase-locking value (PLV) in the delta (0.1-3 Hz) and theta (3-7 Hz) frequency bands. Strong and transient HGB activations peaked first in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, followed by a more gradual increase in the lateral parietal, sensorimotor, and frontal cortices, accompanied by deactivations in default mode network areas. The connectivity patterns were more extensive during calculation than number recognition, with the theta PLV peaking ~150 ms earlier than the delta PLV. Earliest connectivity appeared, surprisingly, between ventral temporal and frontal regions at ~100-200 ms, evolving into a robust pattern among key network nodes at ~200-400 ms after the presentation of each operand. The presented results elucidate information flow within the putative arithmetic network during calculation in the human brain, offering high-temporal-resolution insights into its functional architecture.",

    "title": "Talking avatars can differentially modulate cortical speech tracking in the high and in the low delta band",
    "content": "In noisy listening environments, visual cues from a speaker's face can significantly boost speech comprehension. The underlying audiovisual integration in the brain involves neural tracking of audiovisual speech features. Moreover, lip reading in silence is associated with tracking of the speech envelope in the low-delta frequency band (0.5 - 1 Hz). Recently, digital avatars have emerged that can support speech comprehension. Yet, it remains unclear how the human brain integrates such artificial visual signals with natural speech. Here, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the neural response to a natural video, an avatar generated by deep neural networks, and a degraded video serving as a control. We demonstrate that the avatar can enhance speech-in-noise comprehension to a similar degree as the degraded video, although less than the natural video. We further identify a late response at 600 ms in the neural tracking of the auditory cortex in the high delta band (1 - 4 Hz) that predicts audiovisual speech comprehension. In contrast, we found that neural tracking in the low delta band is related to silent lip-reading performance. Importantly, the tracking in the low delta band evoked by the avatars is much weaker and occurs earlier than that elicited by the other audiovisual stimuli. Neural tracking in the theta band (4 - 8 Hz) is not involved in audiovisual integration. Our results show that the low delta band and the high delta band play clearly distinct roles in visual-only and audiovisual speech processing, and suggest potential avenues for further boosting the abilities of avatars to support speech comprehension.",

    "title": "Neural representations supporting generalization under continual learning",
    "content": "Abstraction and generalization are essential for flexible decision-making in novel situations. Recent work in humans and monkeys has shown how abstract variables are encoded by the representational geometry of neural population activity. However, these observations--which are typically made after learning has converged--demonstrate the product of abstraction, but not the process by which abstract knowledge is learned: how are the inputs from concrete experiences transformed into abstract knowledge, and how do neural circuits perform these operations and relay this knowledge? To address these questions, we developed a factorized model of temporal abstraction that builds on the successor representation. The model disentangles the contributions of different levels of abstract learning--from stimulus-stimulus associations to a generalizable task schema--in the form of a factorized prediction error that relates the change in relational knowledge to a predicted change in representational geometry on each trial. We fit the model to the behavior of human participants performing a context-dependent decision task during fMRI. The model captured the learning dynamics at multiple timescales, including the increasing contribution of generalization as participants transferred abstracted relational knowledge between novel task instances. In fMRI, BOLD activity in hippocampus--where, in past work, abstract knowledge was represented after learning--was increasingly attributed to the acquisition of abstract knowledge based on generalization. A similar temporal pattern was observed in entorhinal cortex, a putative source of low-dimensional structural information, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which may depend on relational knowledge to represent state relationships as a cognitive map that guides choices. Indeed, individual variation in the generalization signal in OFC correlated with behavioral performance on key trials that required relational knowledge. Our findings show how the brain regions previously shown to represent abstract knowledge after learning also support the process of abstraction as it evolves from learning concrete associations to a generalizable schema. Our approach offers a computational framework for disentangling the operations driving abstract learning and probing their neural correlates in the dynamics of representational geometry.",

    "title": "Mapping subcortical fear pathways in the human brain: thalamo-amygdala connections revealed by high-resolution tractography",
    "content": "Influential models of emotion have postulated the existence of several direct subcortical pathways, or ''low roads'', that convey fast sensory thalamic inputs to the amygdala for affective processing. In rodents and non-human primates, specific thalamo-amygdala connections have been identified and linked to fear responses. These connections mainly originate in three thalamic nuclear groups (posterior, intralaminar, and medial) and project to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, the existence of similar thalamo-amygdala pathways in humans remains uncertain. Here, aiming to reproduce subcortical amygdala connections previously described in the non-human animal literature, we mapped those tracts in 113 human participants of either sex. We implemented an advanced high-resolution tractography protocol optimized for reliably tracing axonal pathways through regions with complex white-matter architecture. We reconstructed white matter tracts connecting thalamic nuclei to the BLA, and assessed their test-retest reproducibility to evaluate their anatomical plausibility. Among posterior thalamic nuclei, projections from the medial geniculate nucleus and the medial and inferior pulvinar to the BLA emerged as the strongest and most robust thalamo-amygdala pathways. In turn, the mediodorsal nucleus within the medial group exhibited a prominent connection to the BLA, with a high number of streamlines and moderate-to-high reliability across sessions. Finally, intralaminar thalamic nuclei (parafascicular, central medial, and centromedian) showed consistent connections to the BLA, albeit with higher intrasubject variability and moderate-to-low reproducibility. Together, these findings provide a unifying anatomical framework for multiple direct thalamo-amygdala pathways in the human brain, and suggest the existence of distinct evolutionarily conserved routes for subcortical affective processing.",

    "content": "Aims The human auditory system represents sounds at multiple levels, from low-level acoustic features to abstract category- and object-level information. Although selective auditory attention enables listening in complex soundscapes, it remains unclear which representational levels are modulated by attention and how this depends on scene structure. Using fMRI, representational similarity analysis (RSA), and cross-experiment decoding, this study examined how attention modulates neural representations of sound features under different competitive listening conditions. Methods Twenty participants completed an fMRI experiment involving three selective attention conditions: one sound presented alone, three overlapping sounds from different categories, and three overlapping sounds from the same category. Neural activation patterns were compared to models of multiple low-level acoustic and abstract sound features using RSA, with covariance between models statistically removed to isolate unique representations. Attentional modulation was quantified by contrasting representations of attended and ignored sound features, and cross-experiment decoding was used to assess object-identity representations. Conclusions Low-level acoustic features were robustly represented in early auditory cortex, whereas abstract sound features were broadly represented along temporal and frontal regions of the auditory ventral stream. Attentional modulation was task-dependent: when competing sounds could not be distinguished by category, attention enhanced low-level acoustic feature processing, whereas in cross-category scenes attention primarily targeted abstract category-level representations. Object-identity representations were modulated by attention across both scene types, with category-specific differences. These findings demonstrate that auditory attention flexibly targets the representational level most informative for resolving competition in complex soundscapes.",

    "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
    "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

    "title": "Lactylation in post-stroke fatigue: linking metabolic dysregulation to neuroinflammation",
    "content": "Lactylation, a recently identified post-translational modification derived from lactate, has emerged as a key immunometabolic regulator in neurological disorders. In the context of ischemic stroke, abnormal lactate accumulation not only reflects energy metabolism dysfunction but also drives protein lactylation, which dynamically influences neuronal survival, glial activation, and neuroinflammatory cascades. Increasing evidence indicates that lactylation modulates transcriptional programs of microglia and astrocytes, amplifying inflammatory responses through histone modifications and metabolic enzyme regulation. These processes contribute critically to the onset and persistence of post-stroke fatigue (PSF), a debilitating complication that impairs recovery and quality of life in stroke survivors. This review integrates recent findings on lactylation-mediated regulation of immune and inflammatory pathways, with a particular focus on its effects on apoptosis-related signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine production. Furthermore, we highlight lactylation-related enzymes, including p300 and HDAC3, as potential therapeutic targets, and discuss emerging biomarkers for monitoring lactylation dynamics in stroke patients. By framing lactylation as a metabolic\u2013epigenetic bridge connecting cellular energy states with immune responses, this article provides new insights into the immunopathogenesis of PSF and identifies promising directions for translational intervention.",

    "content": "IntroductionTranscranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) with near-infrared light is a promising non-invasive method to enhance cognition and support brain health. However, its mechanistic effects on large-scale cortical dynamics remain poorly understood. Establishing how tPBM reorganizes oscillatory hierarchies is critical for advancing both neuroscience and clinical translation.MethodsWe examined whether acute 1,064-nm tPBM modulates oscillatory power, dipole source trajectories, and functional connectivity in the human brain. Simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded in 25 healthy adults before and after prefrontal tPBM. Distributed source imaging (sLORETA) and global optimization dipole modeling characterized spatiotemporal alpha and beta activity. Connectivity was assessed with phase transfer entropy, and infra-slow phase\u2013amplitude coupling analyses assessed hierarchical modulation.ResultsTranscranial photobiomodulation induced frequency-specific reorganization of cortical networks. Alpha oscillations engaged coordinated fronto\u2013visual circuits, whereas beta activity preferentially recruited higher-order executive regions. Source imaging revealed a post-stimulation shift from default mode toward central executive network dominance with stronger directed interactions. Infra-slow rhythms (<0.1 Hz), encompassing both very-low-frequency (0.01\u20130.1 Hz) and ultra-slow (<0.01 Hz) activity, significantly modulated alpha- and beta-band amplitudes, embedding faster oscillations within slower temporal patterns.DiscussionThe findings of his work indicate that tPBM influences intrinsic brain activity by reorganizing oscillatory patterns and shifting network engagement. The redistribution from default mode toward executive systems, along with the nesting of faster rhythms within slower temporal structures, reflects a capacity for large-scale functional rebalancing. The results highlight tPBM\u2019s potential as a precision neuromodulation tool for modulating executive and cognitive control systems.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo elucidate the influence of sex differences on the clinical characteristics of anti-NMDAR encephalitis during the acute phase.MethodsPatients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who were hospitalized at Huanhu Hospital, affiliated with Tianjin University, from January 2020 to January 2025 were collected. They were divided into two groups: male and female. Clinical data for both groups were gathered, including age, history of prodromal infection, clinical manifestations, complications, presence of tumor, laboratory indices, MRI findings, GCS scores, length of hospital stay, treatment regimens, and acute phase outcomes. Statistical methods were employed to compare the differences between the two groups.ResultsA total of 43 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis were included in this study, comprising 20 male patients (46.51%) and 23 female patients (53.49%). Female patients were more likely to exhibit decreased levels of consciousness compared to male patients (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f4.113, p\u202f=\u202f0.043). Additionally, the antibody titers in CSF of female patients were significantly higher than those in male patients too (Z\u202f=\u202f\u22122.870, p\u202f=\u202f0.004). Interestingly, CSF protein levels were higher in male patients than in female patients (Z\u202f=\u202f\u22122.591, p\u202f=\u202f0.019), and male patients were more prone to test positive for anti-MOG antibodies (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f5.715, p\u202f=\u202f0.017). The treatment improvement rate for female patients was lower than that for male patients (Z\u202f=\u202f4.768, p\u202f=\u202f0.029), and family members of female patients were more likely to automatic discharge (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f4.075, p\u202f=\u202f0.044).ConclusionFemale patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis experience greater challenges and difficulties compared to male patients. Therefore, it is necessary to choose more proactive treatment options for female patients to help reduce the risk of adverse outcome in acute phase.",

This study hypothesized that improvements in WM recall are associated with enhanced \u03b8-band\u2013mediated information segregation in frontal brain regions.MethodsSixty healthy participants were randomly assigned to three BB stimulation groups: Group A (\u03b1-BB, 10 Hz), Group B (\u03b2-BB, 14 Hz), and Group C (\u03b3-BB, 30 Hz). Electroencephalography (EEG; 14 channels, 128 Hz sampling rate) was recorded before (Pre), during (Du), and after (Post) BB stimulation. Cognitive performance was assessed using a digit-span test. EEG power spectra and graph-theoretical network metrics were analyzed across \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 frequency bands. Correlations between EEG measures and cognitive changes were computed, and paired t-tests were used to compare Pre-, Du-, and Post-BB conditions.Results\u03b8-band activity showed a significant positive correlation with cognitive improvements, particularly in frontal and parietal regions. Group A demonstrated significant increases in \u03b8-band clustering coefficient and local efficiency at both global and fronto-parietal network levels, along with enhanced in-degree and out-degree centrality. Group C exhibited increased \u03b8-band clustering coefficient during the Post-BB phase and greater betweenness centrality in fronto-parietal regions.

    "title": "FocusUI: Efficient UI Grounding via Position-Preserving Visual Token Selection",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.03928v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.03546v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.03534v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Bikeability assessment is essential for advancing sustainable urban transportation and creating cyclist-friendly cities, and it requires incorporating users' perceptions of safety and comfort. Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.",

However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.03273v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.00911v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Automated negotiations in insurance and business-to-business (B2B) commerce encounter substantial challenges. Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust. This study introduces a device-native autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent system for privacy-preserving negotiations. The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.03825v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this paper, we propose GesFi, a novel WiFi-based gesture recognition system that introduces WiFi latent domain mining to redefine domains directly from the data itself. GesFi first processes raw sensing data collected from WiFi receivers using CSI-ratio denoising, Short-Time Fast Fourier Transform, and visualization techniques to generate standardized input representations. It then employs class-wise adversarial learning to suppress gesture semantic and leverages unsupervised clustering to automatically uncover latent domain factors responsible for distributional shifts. These latent domains are then aligned through adversarial learning to support robust cross-domain generalization. Finally, the system is applied to the target environment for robust gesture inference. We deployed GesFi under both single-pair and multi-pair settings using commodity WiFi transceivers, and evaluated it across multiple public datasets and real-world environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, GesFi achieves up to 78% and 50% performance improvements over existing adversarial methods, and consistently outperforms prior generalization approaches across most cross-domain tasks.",

    "title": "AR Object Layout Method Using Miniature Room Generated from Depth Data",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.03588v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In augmented reality (AR), users can place virtual objects anywhere in a real-world room, called AR layout. Although several object manipulation techniques have been proposed in AR, it is difficult to use them for AR layout owing to the difficulty in freely changing the position and size of virtual objects. In this study, we make the World-in-Miniature (WIM) technique available in AR to support AR layout. The WIM technique is a manipulation technique that uses miniatures, which has been proposed as a manipulation technique for virtual reality (VR). Our system uses the AR device's depth sensors to acquire a mesh of the room in real-time to create and update a miniature of a room in real-time. In our system, users can use miniature objects to move virtual objects to arbitrary positions and scale them to arbitrary sizes. In addition, because the miniature object can be manipulated instead of the real-scale object, we assumed that our system will shorten the placement time and reduce the workload of the user. In our previous study, we created a prototype and investigated the properties of manipulating miniature objects in AR. In this study, we conducted an experiment to evaluate how our system can support AR layout. To conduct a task close to the actual use, we used various objects and made the participants design an AR layout of their own will. The results showed that our system significantly reduced workload in physical and temporal demand. Although, there was no significant difference in the total manipulation time.",

As interactions increasingly move online, the act of digitally severing a relationship - e.g. through blocking or unfriending - has become progressively more common as well. This study considers actions of \"digital severance\" through interviews with 30 participants with experience as the initiator and/or recipient of such situations. Through a critical interpretative lens, we explore how people perceive and interpret their severance experience and how the online setting of social media shapes these dynamics. We develop themes that position digital severance as being intertwined with power and control, and we highlight (im)balances between an individual's desires that can lead to feelings of disempowerment and ambiguous loss for both parties. We discuss the implications of our research, outlining three key tensions and four open questions regarding digital relationships, meaning-making, and design outcomes for future exploration.",

However, for practitioners to directly leverage research findings in UI improvements, practical tools are needed. To bridge this gap between research and development in VR systems, we propose a system that estimates object selection success rates within a development tool (Unity). In this paper, we validate the underlying theory, describe the tool's functions, and report feedback from VR developers who tried the tool to assess its usefulness.",

    "title": "SPD Matrix Learning for Neuroimaging Analysis: Perspectives, Methods, and Challenges",
    "content": "arXiv:2504.18882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Neuroimaging provides essential tools for characterizing brain activity by quantifying connectivity strength between remote regions, using different modalities that capture different aspects of connectivity. Yet, decoding meaningful neural signatures must contend with modality-specific challenges, including measurement noise, spatial and temporal distortions, heterogeneous acquisition protocols, and limited sample sizes. A unifying perspective emerges when these data are expressed through symmetric positive definite (SPD)-valued representations: across neuroimaging modalities, SPD-valued representations naturally give rise to SPD matrices that capture dependencies between sensors or brain regions. Endowing the SPD space with Riemannian metrics equips it with a non-Euclidean geometric structure, enabling principled statistical modeling and machine learning on the resulting manifold.\n  This review consolidates machine learning methodologies that operate on the SPD manifold under a unified framework termed SPD matrix learning. SPD matrix learning brings conceptual clarity across multiple modalities, establishes continuity with decades of geometric statistics in neuroimaging, and positions SPD modeling as a methodological bridge between classical analysis and emerging AI-driven paradigms. We show that (i) modeling on the SPD manifold is mathematically natural and numerically stable, preserving symmetry and positive definiteness while avoiding degeneracies inherent to Euclidean embeddings; (ii) SPD matrix learning extends a broad family of established geometric statistical tools used across neuroimaging; and (iii) SPD matrix learning integrates new-generation AI technologies, driving a new class of neuroimaging problems that were previously out of reach. Taken together, SPD matrix learning offers a principled and forward-looking framework for next-generation neuroimaging analytics.",

    "content": "arXiv:2502.20408v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked significant interest among researchers to understand their mechanisms and functional characteristics. Although prior studies have attempted to explain LLM functionalities by identifying and interpreting specific neurons, these efforts mostly focus on individual neuron contributions, neglecting the fact that human brain functions are realized through intricate interaction networks. Inspired by research on functional brain networks (FBNs) in the field of neuroscience, we utilize similar methodologies estabilished in FBN analysis to explore the \"functional networks\" within LLMs in this study. Experimental results highlight that, much like the human brain, LLMs exhibit certain functional networks that recur frequently during their operation. Further investigation reveals that these functional networks are indispensable for LLM performance. Inhibiting key functional networks severely impairs the model's capabilities. Conversely, amplifying the activity of neurons within these networks can enhance either the model's overall performance or its performance on specific tasks. This suggests that these functional networks are strongly associated with either specific tasks or the overall performance of the LLM.

Stigmergy, where agents modify a shared environment that then modifies their behavior, is a classic mechanism that can encode this strategy. We develop a theoretical framework for stigmergic transport by casting it as a stochastic optimal control problem: agents (collectively) lay and (individually) follow trails while minimizing expected traversal time. Simulations and analysis reveal two emergent behaviors: path straightening in homogeneous environments and path refraction at material interfaces, both consistent with experimental observations of insect trails. While reminiscent of Fermat's principle, our results show how local, noisy agent+field interactions can give rise to geodesic trajectories in heterogeneous environments, without centralized coordination or global knowledge, relying instead on an embodied slow fast dynamical mechanism.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.03796v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present a data-driven framework to characterize large-scale brain dynamical states directly from correlation matrices at the single-subject level. By treating correlation thresholding as a percolation-like probe of connectivity, the approach tracks multiple cluster- and network-level observables and identifies a characteristic percolation threshold, rc, at which these signatures converge. We use $r_c$ as an operational and physically interpretable descriptor of large-scale brain dynamical state. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort of healthy individuals (N = 996), the method yields stable, subject-specific estimates that covary systematically with established dynamical indicators such as temporal autocorrelations. Numerical simulations of a whole-brain model with a known critical regime further show that $r_c$ tracks changes in collective dynamics under controlled variations of excitability. By replacing arbitrary threshold selection with a criterion intrinsic to correlation structure, the r-spectra provides a physically grounded approach for comparing brain dynamical states across individuals.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.03498v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As intelligent systems are developed across diverse substrates - from machine learning models and neuromorphic hardware to in vitro neural cultures - understanding what gives a system agency has become increasingly important. Existing definitions, however, tend to rely on top-down descriptions that are difficult to quantify. We propose a bottom-up framework grounded in a system's information-processing order: the extent to which its transformation of input evolves over time. We identify three orders of information processing. Class I systems are reactive and memoryless, mapping inputs directly to outputs. Class II systems incorporate internal states that provide memory but follow fixed transformation rules. Class III systems are adaptive; their transformation rules themselves change as a function of prior activity. While not sufficient on their own, these dynamics represent necessary informational conditions for genuine agency. This hierarchy offers a measurable, substrate-independent way to identify the informational precursors of agency. We illustrate the framework with neurophysiological and computational examples, including thermostats and receptor-like memristors, and discuss its implications for the ethical and functional evaluation of systems that may exhibit agency.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.03478v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Collective improvisation in dance provides a rich natural laboratory for studying emergent coordination in coupled neuro-motor systems. Here, we investigate how training shapes spontaneous synchronization patterns in both movement and brain signals during collaborative performance. Using a dual-recording protocol integrating 3D motion capture and hyperscanning EEG, participants engaged in free, interaction-driven, and rule-based improvisation before and after a program of generative dance, grounded in cellular-automata. Motor behavior was modeled through a time-resolved {\\alpha}-exponent derived from Movement Element Decomposition scaling between mean velocity and displacement, revealing fluctuations in energetic strategies and degrees of freedom. Synchronization events were quantified using Motif Synchronization (biomechanical data) and multilayer Time-Varying Graphs (neural data), enabling the detection of nontrivial lead-lag dependencies beyond zero-lag entrainment. Results indicate that training produced an intriguing dissociation: inter-brain synchronization increased, particularly within the frontal lobe, while interpersonal motor synchrony decreased. This opposite trend suggests that enhanced participatory sense-making fosters neural alignment while simultaneously expanding individual motor explorations, thereby reducing coupling in movement. Our findings position collaborative improvisation as a complex dynamical regime in which togetherness emerges not from identical motor outputs but from shared neural intentionality distributed across multilayer interaction networks, exemplifying the coupling-decoupling paradox, whereby increasing inter-brain synchrony supports the exploration of broader and mutually divergent motor trajectories. These results highlight the nonlinear nature of social coordination, offering new avenues for modeling creative joint action in human systems.",

    "content": "Complex spiral traveling waves observed experimentally occurs across the cortex. The underlying mechanisms responsible for generating such mesoscopic activity are not well understood. Understanding how local cortical neuronal populations interact to produce emergent spirals dynamics during cognitive processing remains unknown. Therefore, to bridge this gap, a spatiotemporal cortical field rate model of local cortical circuits composed of excitatory and three distinct time-scale inhibitory populations is proposed which is extended as a two dimensional cortical sheet consisting of both nonlinear local interactions and diffusive global coupling of distance dependent axonal delays. Simulation results indicates mixed-mode oscillations that might represent the coexistence of multiple rhythms and shows emergence of complex dynamics such as rotating spirals with annihilation events. Spiral waves differentially respond to the strength of the grating input stimulus and exhibit working memory like characteristics. Also hypothesize that local patterns, such as planar, source, sink, or concentric across the cortex might be an inherent integral part of the spiral state dynamics.",

We examined acute cortical responses to two metal-rich AirP sources, diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and World Trade Center (WTC) dust, and compared them to woodsmoke (WS), a particulate exposure with low metal content. DEP and WTC elicited highly convergent transcriptional responses, sharing over 1200 differentially expressed genes linked to inflammation, ferroptosis, neuronal remodeling, and amyloid processing. These changes were accompanied by impaired antioxidant activity and increased lipid peroxidation within lipid rafts, a membrane microdomain critical for amyloid processing, resulting in increased A{beta} generation. In contrast, WS produced a distinct transcriptional signature and failed to induce ferroptotic priming or lipid peroxidation, consistent with its low metal composition. Together, these findings implicate metals as a shared driver linking diverse AirP exposures to amyloidogenic vulnerability and elevated AD risk.",

    "title": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (PTPR\u03ba) regulates Superior ON-Direction Selective Ganglion Cell development, facilitating image stabilization",
    "content": "In vertebrates, gaze stabilization during global visual motion requires ON direction-selective ganglion cells (oDSGCs) in the Accessory Optic System (AOS) to drive the optokinetic reflex (OKR). Three types of oDSGCs form independent mosaics; however, the mechanisms that specify and maintain their numbers to create these mosaics during development remain unknown. Here, we identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (Ptprk) as a key regulator of Superior oDSGC density, the subtype tuned to upward motion. High-depth single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) reveals that Ptprk is selectively enriched in Superior oDSGCs compared to Inferior oDSGCs, which detect downward motion. Genetic deletion of Ptprk selectively halves the number of Superior oDSGCs while preserving the number of Inferior oDSGCs. Anatomically, Superior oDSGCs in Ptprk mutants exhibit compensatory neurite remodeling to preserve mosaics. Physiologically, oDSGCs have broader tuning curves, and a subset of Superior oDSGCS have aberrant preferred directions in Ptprk mutants. Postsynaptically, loss of Ptprk reduces oDSGC connectivity to central targets. Behaviorally, the OKR responses to upward motion are attenuated in both global and pan-retinal Ptprk mutants, confirming a retinal role for Ptprk in upward image stabilization. Together, these findings demonstrate that the density of a retinal ganglion cell type is under molecular control, and that reducing density drives neurite remodeling, alters circuit computation, and ultimately impairs visually-guided behavior.",

    "title": "I built Embex: A Universal Vector Database ORM with a Rust core for 2-3x faster vector operations",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Embex is a universal ORM for vector databases. It provides a unified Python API to interact with multiple vector store providers (currently Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma, LanceDB, Milvus, Weaviate, and PgVector).</p> <p>Under the hood, it is not just a Python wrapper. I implemented the core logic in <strong>Rust</strong> using the &quot;BridgeRust&quot; framework I developed. This Rust core is compiled into a Python extension module using <strong>PyO3</strong>.</p> <p>This architecture allows Embex to perform heavy vector math operations (like cosine similarity and dot products) using SIMD intrinsics (AVX2/NEON) directly in the Rust layer, which are then exposed to Python. This results in vector operations that are roughly <strong>4x faster</strong> than standard scalar implementations, while keeping the Python API idiomatic and simple.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This library is designed for:</p> <ul> <li><strong>AI/ML Engineers</strong> building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines who want to switch between vector databases (e.g., local LanceDB/Chroma for dev, Pinecone for prod) without rewriting their data access layer.</li> <li><strong>Backend Developers</strong> who need a consistent interface for vector storage that doesn't lock them into a single vendor's SDK.</li> <li><strong>Performance enthusiasts</strong> looking for Python tools that leverage Rust for low-level optimization.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>vs. Native SDKs (e.g.,</strong> <code>pinecone-client</code><strong>,</strong> <code>qdrant-client</code><strong>):</strong> Native SDKs are tightly coupled to their specific backend. If you start with one and want to migrate to another, you have to rewrite your query logic. Embex abstracts this; you change the provider configuration, and your <code>search</code> or <code>insert</code> code remains exactly the same.</li> <li><strong>vs. LangChain VectorStores:</strong> LangChain is a massive framework where the vector store is just one small part of a huge ecosystem. Embex is a standalone, lightweight ORM focused solely on the database layer. It is less opinionated about your overall application architecture and significantly lighter to install if you don't need the rest of LangChain.</li> <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Because the vector operations happen in the compiled Rust core using SIMD instructions, Embex benchmarks at 3.6x - 4.0x faster for mathematical vector operations compared to pure Python or non-SIMD implementations.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Links &amp; Source</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust\">https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI:</strong> <code>pip install embex</code></li> <li><strong>Docs:</strong><a href=\"https://bridgerust.dev/embex/introduction\">https://bridgerust.dev/embex/introduction</a></li> </ul> <p>I would love feedback on the API design or the PyO3 bindings implementation!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maleficent-Dance-34\"> /u/Maleficent-Dance-34 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i_built_embex_a_universal_vector_database_orm/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i_built_embex_a_universal_vector_database_orm/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I don't provide IO or parallelism however (which is something that polars can do way better and for which my library is designed to interoperate fluently, see some examples in the website)</li> <li>Compared to fit_it , I'm fully typed and provide much more functionalities (collection types, interoperability between types)</li> <li>Compared to streamable (which seems like a solid alternative) I provide different types (Result, Option, collection types), should be faster for most operations (streamable reimplement in python a lot of things, I mostly delegate to cytoolz (Cython) and itertools (C) whenever possible with as less function call overhead as possible). I don't provide async functionnalities (streamable do) but it's absolutely something I could consider.</li> </ul> <p>The biggest difference in all cases is that my Iterator methods are designed to also interoperate with Option and Result when it make sense.</p> <p>For example, <code>Iter.filter_map</code> will behave like Rust filter_map (hence for Iterators of Option types).</p> <p>If you need filter_map behavior as you expect in Python, you can simply call .filter.map.<br /> This is all exhaustively documented and typed anyway.</p> <p><strong>For monads/results/returns libraries</strong>:</p> <p>There's a lot of different ones, and they all provide their own opinion and functionnalities.<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/dbrattli/Expression\">https://github.com/dbrattli/Expression</a> for example says it's derived from F.<br /> There's also Pymonad, returns, etc... all with their own API (decorators, haskell-like, etc...) and at the end of the day it's personal taste.</p> <p>My goal is to orient it as close as possible to Rust API.</p> <p>Hence, the most closely related projects are:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/rustedpy/result\">https://github.com/rustedpy/result</a> -&gt; not maintained anymore. There's a fork, but in all cases, it only provides Result and Option, not Iterators etc...</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/MaT1g3R/option\">https://github.com/MaT1g3R/option</a> -&gt; doesn't seem maintained anymore, and again, only provides Option and Result<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/rustedpy/maybe\">https://github.com/rustedpy/maybe</a> -&gt; same thing<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/mplanchard/safetywrap/blob/master/src/safetywrap/_impl.py\">https://github.com/mplanchard/safetywrap/blob/master/src/safetywrap/_impl.py</a> -&gt; same thing</p> <p>In all cases it seems like I'm the only one to provide all types and interoperability.</p> <p>Looking forward to constructive criticism!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beginning-Fruit-1397\"> /u/Beginning-Fruit-1397 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q61bzg/pyochain_rustlike_iterator_result_and_option_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q61bzg/pyochain_rustlike_iterator_result_and_option_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION. Despite widespread cortical involvement in Lewy body diseases, conventional grey matter MRI measures have limited sensitivity. Microstructural measures from diffusion MRI may be more sensitive to early changes. METHODS. We examined grey matter microstructure in 197 participants across the Lewy body diseases spectrum: 88 Lewy body dementia (LBD), 109 Parkinson's normal cognition (PD-NC), and 46 controls. We compared tissue-weighted neurite density (tNDI), orientation dispersion index (tODI), and free water fraction (FWF) cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We examined relationships between microstructure, disease severity and plasma p-tau217. RESULTS. LBD participants showed widespread cortical and subcortical tODI and FWF increases compared to controls and PD-NC, despite minimal atrophy. These changes correlated with cognitive (but not motor severity) and with p-tau217. In 100 Parkinson's patients followed-up over 3 years, cortical FWF increased in those developing cognitive decline. DISCUSSION. Microstructural measures capture early grey matter changes, offering a sensitive marker of grey matter integrity in Lewy body diseases.",

    "title": "Reactive Astrocytes Drive Extracellular Acidification to Mediate \u03b1-Synuclein Neurodegeneration",
    "content": "Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as key players in neurodegeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms by which they drive disease remain elusive. Here, we uncover a fundamental pathway in which reactive astrocytes fuel neurodegeneration in -synucleinopathies-including Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia-by acidifying the brain's extracellular environment. We demonstrate that both human patient tissue and a gut-to-brain -synuclein mouse model exhibit accumulation of reactive astrocytes and extracellular acidosis. Mechanistically, we show that astrocytic lysosomal exocytosis releases acidic contents, driving a drop in pH that activates neuronal acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), resulting in neuronal loss and behavioral decline. Blocking this pathway-either by inhibiting astrocytic lysosomal exocytosis or genetically or pharmacologically targeting neuronal ASIC1a-mitigates pathology and rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in vivo. These findings provide a conceptual advance by establishing a mechanistic link between glial inflammation, acid-base homeostasis, and neuronal vulnerability, and suggest that targeting astrocyte-driven acidification or ASIC1a signaling could offer new avenues for disease modification in -synucleinopathies.",

    "title": "Disrupted dynamics of brain structure function coupling link genetic risk of Alzheimer's Disease and aging to cognitive decline in 34,067 adults",
    "content": "Understanding how a stable structural connectome supports flexible cognition, especially in aging, is a fundamental question in neuroscience. While static structure function coupling (SFC) is well-studied, the dynamic decoupling of functional activity from structural constraints, dynamic SFC (DSFC), remains poorly understood. Leveraging MRI data from 34,067 UK Biobank participants (ages 45~82), we characterized the distinct roles of SFC and DSFC in aging, cognition, and health. We found that SFC and DSFC followed spatially divergent aging trajectories: SFC declined primarily in sensorimotor systems, whereas DSFC decreased most prominently in higher order networks. Both SFC and DSFC in higher-order networks were positively correlated with cognitive performance (e.g., fluid intelligence). However, the associations with mental and physical health diverged between the two measures: reduced DSFC was predominantly linked to health burdens in high-order default/limbic networks, whereas weakened SFC was primarily associated with health burdens in low-order sensory-motor networks. Genetic analyses revealed that Alzheimer's risk, specifically APOE4 dosage, significantly reduced DSFC in higher-order cognitive networks and SFC in visual cortex. Mediation analyses further demonstrated that aging and APOE4-linked cognitive decline were mediated via visual SFC and ventral attention DSFC. These findings position static and dynamic coupling as complementary mechanisms: static SFC preserves network robustness, while dynamic SFC enables transient reconfiguration for complex integration. Together, our results highlight these dual mechanisms as crucial for maintaining cognitive flexibility, providing potential biomarkers for age-related neurodegeneration.",

    "title": "Maximum entropy model reveals frequent brain state switching in psychotic disorders in a multiversal brain function analysis",
    "content": "Background: Regional activation and pairwise correlation are mainstay neuroimaging methods. Yet, neither approach fully captures how brain networks evolve and interact over time. The maximum entropy model (MEM), which integrates regional and inter-regional activity, represents a promising integrative approach to examine dynamically evolving functional networks. Methods: Activation-only, pairwise-coactivation-only analyses and an MEM framework were applied to the Human Connectome Project-Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) dataset (109 patients, 56 controls). Using the 360-node HCP/Glasser atlas to define brain regions from the default mode (DMN) and dorsal attention (DAN) networks, group differences were quantified in nodal frequency band power, functional connectivity (FC), and MEM features such as transition rates between basins in energy landscapes and their associations with cognitive and psychopathological measures were examined. Results: Psychosis was associated with reduced first-order BOLD frequency band power and FC graph metrics. Findings specific to the MEM demonstrated a wider variety of DMN and DAN activation/deactivation patterns, with more frequent switching between them during the resting state in psychosis. Network configuration differences were more pronounced in sub-systems comprised of both DMN and DAN nodes. While BOLD frequency band power of a few regions correlated with working memory, none of the graph metrics correlated. However, basins transitions and energy correlated negatively with working memory. Conclusion: MEM provides unique information unavailable from other analyses. Results converge among first-order-only, second-order-only, and MEM analyses, suggesting attenuated inter-network connectivity with less stability of DMN and DAN brain states in psychosis. Such changes may underlie cognitive impairments, specifically basin transitions rates in psychosis.",

    "title": "Computational modeling and preclinical validation support targeting somatic instability for Huntington's disease treatment",
    "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Genetic modifiers of disease onset and progression in HD implicate somatic instability (SI) of the expanded CAG repeat as a key pathogenic driver, with MSH3 emerging as a leading therapeutic target. Reducing SI, particularly in the most affected neuronal cell type, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum, is thus a rational therapeutic strategy for HD. To inform the development of an SI-targeted therapy, we generated a computational model simulating SI in MSNs to infer therapeutic effects on MSN survival resulting from an intervention that reduces SI. The model takes advantage of HD patient data to predict therapeutic benefit across a range of inherited CAG lengths and ages of intervention, considering the degree of target engagement regionally and per cell. To target SI experimentally, we designed an artificial microRNA to lower MSH3 mRNA (miMSH3) after delivery with AAV-DB-3, a previously described MSN-targeting AAV capsid variant. AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 achieved from 48 to 94% MSH3 mRNA reduction in MSNs of nonhuman primates (NHPs), which, when modeled, would reduce the composite Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale change over baseline from 50 to over 120% as well as delay motor symptom onset by many years. AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 also showed robust target engagement in vivo with up to 46% reduction in SI in HdhQ111 mice. The integration of preclinical experimental data and the computational model support the translational potential of AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 as a disease modifying therapy applicable for HD patients with a broad range of inherited repeat lengths.",

    "title": "Alcohol Use Disorder Affects Brain Metals",
    "content": "Background: One of the risks associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD) is dementia. While the exact pathology is unknown, there is increasing evidence that alcohol consumption may dysregulate iron homeostasis in the brain leading to increased brain iron concentrations. Unregulated iron can produce oxidative stress and cellular damage to neurons. Iron-related cellular death is a relatively new finding and is called ferroptosis. To test the hypothesis that alcohol use disorder may cause brain iron dysregulation, we measured iron in hippocampus, caudate and substantia nigra in brain tissues obtained from individuals diagnosed with (AUD) and from individuals with no apparent alcoholrelated problems. Methods: We obtained hippocampus, caudate, and substantia nigra tissues from the New South Wales Brain Tissue Resource Centre, University of Sydney. The tissues came from 20 males and 20 females, half of each diagnosed with AUD. The tissues were wet-ashed and prepared for analysis of iron, copper, and zinc by total x-ray reflectance fluorescence. Results: In the hippocampus, we observed AUD-related decreased iron, but nothing more. In the substantia nigra, we observed a significant increase in iron and a trend toward an in increase in copper content in females and decreased iron and zinc in males. In the caudate we saw a near doubling of iron in females and a significant increase in copper in females and males. Conclusions: These results provide direct evidence that at least part of AUD-related pathophysiology involves the dysregulation of trace metals in the brain. These changes are more severe in females, which may relate to extended levels of exposure due to slower alcohol metabolism.",

    "title": "High performance sorting of motor unit action potentials with EMUsort",
    "content": "Understanding how neural signals control muscle activity during behavior is a key challenge in motor neuroscience. To this end, recent advances in intramuscular multielectrode arrays have enabled high-quality multichannel recordings of many motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in freely moving subjects. However, identifying individual MUAP events within multichannel recordings is a significant challenge for existing spike sorting methods, which are typically optimized for identifying action potentials from neurons in the brain. To overcome this challenge, we developed the Enhanced Motor Unit sorter (EMUsort), an extension of Kilosort4 (KS4) that achieves high-performance MUAP spike sorting. We applied EMUsort to high-resolution intramuscular recordings from rat forelimb during locomotion and monkey forelimb during a reaching task. EMUsort improves upon prior methods by addressing key challenges encountered with MUAP datasets, including: 1) long time delays across electrodes due to propagation along muscle fibers, 2) more complex waveform shapes compared to neuronal action potentials, and 3) a high degree of MUAP overlap due to cumulative motor unit recruitment. We compared EMUsort to existing spike sorting methods quantitatively using simulated datasets that closely emulated the rat and monkey datasets we recorded. EMUsort provided median error rate reductions of 67.5% and 49.9% during periods of high motor unit activation for the rat and monkey datasets, respectively. In sum, EMUsort provides a substantial improvement to MUAP spike sorter accuracy, especially during regions of high MUAP overlap, in an easy-to-use software package.",

By reading the cube's specific arrangement among 43 quintillion possible configurations, our system generates FIDO2-compatible credentials on-demand. Unlike traditional security tokens that store credentials, the cube itself becomes part of the key with its physical state forming a deterministic seed for keypair generation. Our proof-of-concept, CubeAuthn, demonstrates this concept with a browser extension that authenticates users on WebAuthn-enabled sites using the cube's physical state as the cryptographic seed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46533315\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46533315</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

Today we're launching a key feature for the platform: the ability to generalize on dynamic, templated inputs.<p>Caching at the HTTP request level has the obvious problem of generalizability. Nearly no request is identical, due to templated variables (like names) and metadata (like timestamps), so exact-match cache lookups rarely hit. We solve this at Butter by using LLMs to detect dynamic content in requests and derive their inter-relationships, allowing the cache entry to be stored as a template + variables + deterministic code. This allows future requests to contain different variable data, yet still serve from cache.<p>We've found this approach greatly improves cache hit rate, and believe it could be useful for agents performing repetitive back-office tasks, computer use, or data transformations where input data is frequently of the same shape.<p>- You can see a demo of learning patterns here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA</a><p>- We wrote more about the technical approach here: <a href=\"https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-response-caching\">https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-...</a><p>- It's free to try out here: <a href=\"https://butter.dev/auth\">https://butter.dev/auth</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Noradrenergic infraslow rhythm during sleep is the critical link between heart-rate dynamics and memory consolidation",
    "content": "Recent work shows that the brains arousal system remains active during sleep, with rhythmic locus coeruleus (LC) activity shaping sleep architecture and supporting memory consolidation. The LC releases norepinephrine (NE) in infraslow (~0.02 Hz) bouts that gate NREM sleep spindles. Here, we demonstrate that heart rate (HR) fluctuations during NREM are tightly phase-locked to these NE rhythms, identifying the LC as a key driver of very-low-frequency HR variability (VLF-HRV), an understudied autonomic signal. Using optogenetics, transient LC inhibition blunts HR slowing, whereas LC activation produces rapid HR acceleration, directly linking LC output to cardiac control during sleep. We further show that infraslow HR variability is a cross-species marker of spindle-dependent memory processing. In mice, the amplitude of HR decelerations during NREM predicts spindle activity and subsequent memory performance. Remarkably, human sleepers show the same pattern: stronger VLF-HR fluctuations during NREM correspond to increased spindle expression and better overnight memory retention. These findings reveal a mechanistic pathway through which LC activity modulates autonomic physiology during sleep and identify infraslow HR variability as a non-invasive marker of brainstem function and memory-promoting sleep. Because LC degeneration occurs early in neurodegenerative disease, sleep-derived HR metrics may provide a scalable indicator of emerging neuromodulatory dysfunction.",

    "title": "The fluctuations of alpha power: bimodalities, connectivity, and neural mass models",
    "content": "The alpha rhythm is a hallmark of electrophysiological resting-state brain activity, that serves as a biomarker in health and disease. Alpha power is far from uniform over time, exhibiting dynamic fluctuations. The likelihood of those power values can be captured by a decreasing exponential function, that in certain cases becomes bimodal. While alpha rhythm is usually evaluated through the averaged power spectra across entire recordings, its dynamic fluctuations have received less attention. In this study, we investigate the dynamic nature of alpha power, its relationship with functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN), and the ability of the Jansen-Rit (JR) neural mass model to replicate these fluctuations. Using MRI and MEG data from 42 participants in resting state with eyes-closed and eyes-open, we evaluated the shape of the exponential distributions for alpha power fluctuations, and their relationship with other spectral variables as frequency, power and the aperiodic exponent. Additionally, we assessed the temporal relationship between alpha power and FC using phase-based (ciPLV) and amplitude-based (cAEC) metrics. Finally, we employed diffusion-weighted MRI to construct brain network models incorporating JR neural masses to reproduce and characterize alpha fluctuations. Our results indicate that alpha power predominantly follows unimodal exponential distributions, with bimodalities associated to high-power in posterior regions. FC analyses revealed that ciPLV and cAEC were directly correlated with alpha power within the DMN in alpha and beta bands, whereas only theta-band ciPLV showed an inverse relationship with alpha power. JR model simulations suggested that post- supercritical fixed points better replicated alpha power fluctuations compared to limit cycle parameterizations and pre- saddle node fixed points. These results deepen our understanding of the dynamics of alpha rhythm and its intricate relationship with FC patterns, offering novel insights to refine biologically plausible brain simulations and advance computational models of neural dynamics.",

    "title": "SSAO-mediated decrease of endothelial BDNF release affects neuronal GluA1 and PSD95 expression: a peripheral mechanism inducing NVU and CNS disturbances",
    "content": "Dysfunction of the vascular system contributes to brain damage and neurodegeneration, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) can be identified in a high percentage of Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations can affect communication and signalling between neurovascular unit (NVU) components through changes in the release of angioneurins, among others. The two-hit vascular hypothesis of AD suggests that chronic vascular risk factors cause an early damage to the brain microvasculature (hit 1) triggering a cascade of events that leads to amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) accumulation in the brain and precipitating the A\u03b2-dependent pathway of neurodegeneration (hit 2). The vascular enzyme and adhesion molecule SSAO/VAP-1 plays an important role in cerebrovascular dysfunction and vascular A\u03b2 aggregation, acting as an active player in the first of the two-hits. We generated a new NVU in vitro model to study the role of SSAO/VAP-1 on the BBB dysfunction and its effects on neurons in an AD context. We focused on the release of key angioneurins for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, highly compromised in AD. Our results show that SSAO/VAP-1 expression, together with the addition of A\u03b21-40peptide containing the Dutch mutation (used to mimic CAA condition; A\u03b2D), to cerebral endothelial cells synergistically alter the release of vascular BDNF. This alteration subsequently affects the expression of synaptic markers PSD95 and GluA1 in cortical neurons. Moreover, GluA1 and PSD95-positive neurons present reduced immunolabeling intensity of these markers when low levels of vascular BDNF are present. These results reveal vascular BDNF as a possible key element in the sensitization to A\u03b2 due to SSAO/VAP-1 expression, impacting negatively on glutamatergic synaptic and NVU function.HighlightsSSAO/VAP-1 expression alters BBB decreasing ZO-1, VE-Cadherin and Claudin-5 levels.SSAO/VAP-1 expression alters the release of vascular angioneurin BDNF.SSAO/VAP-1 and A\u03b2D decrease synaptic protein levels affecting glutamatergic neurons.Endothelial BDNF decrease induced by SSAO/VAP-1 and A\u03b2D alters glutamatergic neurons.",

    "title": "Acetaminophen inhibits diacylglycerol lipase synthesis of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol: implications for nociception",
    "content": "SUMMARYThough acetaminophen is a ubiquitous analgesic, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Thus, even though acetaminophen causes \u223c500 deaths each year in the US it has not been possible to design safer alternatives. Because endocannabinoids may have a role in acetaminophen action, we examined interactions between the two. We now report that acetaminophen inhibits the activity of diacylglycerol lipase \u03b1 (DAGL\u03b1), but not DAGL\u03b2, decreasing production of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. This gave rise to the counterintuitive hypothesis that decreasing endocannabinoid production by DAGL\u03b1inhibitionmay be antinociceptive in certain settings. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that DAGL inhibition by RHC80267 is antinociceptive in wildtype but not CB1 knockout mice in the hotplate test. We propose 1) that activation of DAGL\u03b1 may exacerbate some forms of nociception and 2) a novel mechanism for the antinociceptive actions of acetaminophen whereby acetaminophen inhibits a DAGL\u03b1/CB1-based circuit that plays a permissive role in at least one form of nociception.",

    "content": "Biological motion perception (BMP) is fundamental for interpreting and predicting human actions, playing a crucial role in social cognition. While traditionally viewed as a bottom-up process, recent evidence suggests that top-down mechanisms, particularly expectations, influence BMP. This fMRI study investigates how prior expectations shape BMP by employing a predictive cueing paradigm. Participants discriminated between biological and scrambled motion while presented with congruent, incongruent, or uninformative cues. Behavioral results revealed that correct expectations facilitated performance, while incorrect expectations impaired it. Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) analysis demonstrated bidirectional connectivity within the action observation network (AON), particularly between the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) under all expectation conditions. Additionally, Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) confirmed the involvement of these regions in BMP. These findings challenge traditional bottom-up models by highlighting the role of predictive processes in action perception and provide evidence for expectation-dependent modulation of AON connectivity.",

    "title": "Physical Activity and Depressive Mood Shared the Structural Connectivity between Motor and Reward Network: a population-based study from the UK Biobank",
    "content": "BackgroundExercise has been revealed to leave a positive effect on alleviating depressive symptoms by various existing studies. However, the neural basis behind this phenomenon remains unknown, as well as its underlying biological mechanism.AimsUsing a large neuroimaging cohort from UK Biobank, this study aimed to identify structural connectivity (SC) patterns simultaneously linked with physical activity and depression, as well as its biological interpretation.Method492 participants with major depression disorder (MDD) and 535 healthy controls (HC) were extracted from the UK Biobank dataset. Partial least squares regression was first utilized to explore a replicable SC pattern simultaneously associated with physical activity and depressive mood. The neuromaps toolbox was applied to interpret the biological ontologies of the identified SC pattern. Neuroimaging-transcriptome association and enrichment analyses were conducted to explore its underlying genetic basis, pathways and cell types. The reproducibility and generalizability were tested on another independent MDD dataset (N=3,496) and bipolar disorder (BD) dataset (N=81).ResultsA SC pattern linked with exercise was identified to be both significantly correlated with depressive mood and group discriminative between MDDs and HCs, which primarily located between the motor-related regions and reward-related regions. This pattern was associated with multiple neurotransmitter receptors, such as serotonin and GABA receptors, and enriched in pathways like synaptic signaling and astrocytes cell type. The SC pattern and genetic results were also replicated in another independent MDD dataset and present commonalities with BD.ConclusionsThis study not only initially identified a reproducible shared SC pattern between physical activity and depressive mood, but also elucidated the underlying biological mechanisms, which enhanced our understanding of how exercise helps alleviate depression and may inform the development of novel neuromodulation targets.",

    "title": "Increased Reproducibility of Brain Organoids through Controlled Fluid Dynamics",
    "content": "Brain organoids are a promising model for studying human neurodevelopment and disease. Despite the potential, their 3D structure often exhibits high variability during differentiation across batches and cell lines, presenting a significant challenge for biomedical applications. During their development, organoids are exposed to fluid flow shear stress (fFSS) generated by the flow of culture media over the developing tissue. This stress is thought to disrupt cellular integrity and morphogenesis, leading to variation in organoids architecture, ultimately affecting reproducibility. Understanding the interplay between tissue morphology, cell identity and organoid developmental stage is therefore essential for advancing the use of brain organoids. Here, we demonstrate that reducing fFSS, by employing a vertically rotating chamber during neuronal induction, a critical phase for organoid morphogenesis, along with an extended human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) aggregation phase to minimize fusions, significantly improves the reproducibility of brain organoids. Remarkably, reducing fFSS minimized morphological structure variation and preserved transcriptional signature fidelity across differentiation batches and cell lines. This approach could enhance the reliability of brain organoid models, with important implications for neurodevelopmental research and preclinical studies.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence-augmented drug discovery identifies gefitinib as a potential treatment for ALS",
    "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by motor neuron (MN) death; however, astrocytes play a key role in disease pathogenesis. Developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to impact drug discovery in multiple ways, including the rapid identification of drug repurposing candidates. A combination of natural language processing and deep learning algorithms was used to generate a knowledge graph based on scientific literature, omics and chemical databases, and other public sources with the aim to identify drug repurposing candidates for ALS. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of a cancer compound identified by AI, gefitinib, on MN survival, and to decipher its mode of action inin vitroandin vivomodels of ALS. We used co-cultures of healthy motor neurons with ALS patient-derived astrocytes (iAstrocytes), obtained through a semi-direct conversion protocol, to assess the neuroprotective properties of gefitinib. Compound treatment led to a significant rescue of MNs cultured with ALS iAstrocytes and a significant reduction in the levels of cleaved TDP-43 fragments in ALS iAstrocytes. Our data suggest that gefitinib-mediated activation of autophagy decreased the 35 kDa fragments of TDP-43. In a proof-of-conceptin vivostudy in SOD1G93Amice, gefitinib treatment significantly delayed the onset of neurological symptoms, thus showing the potential of AI-augmented drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders.Significance StatementThis study presents an AI-augmented method of identifying potential repurposing candidates for disease with an unprecedented speed. The AI\u2019s results were validatedin vitrousing iAstrocytes differentiated from induced neuronal progenitor cells (iNPCs), which are pathophysiologically relevant models suitable for studying neurodegeneration. iNPCs recapitulate many pathological hallmarks of the disease and they retain the ageing phenotype of the patient that they are obtained from. TDP-43 proteinopathy is one of the disease hallmarks observed in patients and is present in 97% of ALS patients. Here, we show gefitinib, a repurposing candidate identified by AI, improves survival of MNs in a co-culture with patient-derived astrocytes and can modulate TDP-43 proteinopathy.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate EEG activity following transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) patients and control subjects using a data-driven characterization of brain oscillatory activity without prescribed frequency bands.MethodsWe employed multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to analyze the TMS-EEG response of 38 AD patients and 21 control subjects. We used the distinct features of EEG oscillatory modes to train a classification algorithm, a support vector machine.ResultsAD patients exhibited a weakened slow-frequency response. Faster oscillatory modes displayed a biphasic response pattern in controls, characterized by an early increase followed by a widespread suppression, which was reduced in AD patients. Classification achieved robust discrimination performance (85%/23% true/false positive rate).ConclusionsAD causes an impairment in the oscillatory response to TMS that has distinct features in different frequency ranges. These features uncovered by MEMD could serve as an effective EEG diagnostic marker.SignificanceEarly detection of AD requires diagnostic tools that are both effective and accessible. Combining EEG with TMS shows great promise. Our results and method enhance TMS-EEG both as a practical diagnostic tool, and as a way to further our understanding of AD pathophysiology.",

    "content": "Mutations in ADNP (Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein) are among the most frequent monogenic causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and lead to Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome (HVDAS). Yet how ADNP dysfunction leads to HVDAS is unclear. We employed patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, cortical organoids and ADNP KO human neural stem cells (hNSCs) to clarify the cellular and molecular mechanism of HVDAS onset. We purified an ADNP-KDM1A-GTF2I (AKG) protein complex from hNSCs and show that it targets transposable elements (TEs) to repress nearby gene transcription. Upon ADNP KO, KDM1A binding is lost at promoters targeted by AKG, pointing to ADNP as the anchoring subunit of the AKG complex. HVDAS cortical organoids show impaired progenitor proliferation and accelerated neuronal differentiation, coupled with a sustained upregulation of neurogenesis transcriptional programs, including key transcription factors normally repressed by AKG. This work suggests that the AKG complex acts as the relevant ADNP unit in the molecular onset of HVDAS.",

    "content": "Background Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel non-invasive brain-stimulation technique offering high spatial precision and depth penetrance. Theta burst TUS (tbTUS), featuring a temporal theta burst stimulation pattern, has been reported to facilitate corticomotor excitability, when applied to the human primary motor hand area (M1-HAND). However, replication attempts have yielded inconsistent results. Methods Fifteen healthy human participants underwent neuronavigated tbTUS targeting the left M1-HAND in the anterior wall of the precentral sulcus, as well as anterior and posterior active control sites. The three tbTUS conditions were applied in counterbalanced order on separate days. Corticospinal excitability was assessed via motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded before and 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after tbTUS, and analyzed using an rmANOVA. Results None of the tbTUS conditions produced consistent group-level changes in MEP amplitude at any time point. Both intra- and inter-subject variability were high, and individual MEP changes following precentral tbTUS did not correlate with changes after control-site stimulation. Conclusions We did not observe reliable modulatory effects of neuronavigated tbTUS on corticospinal excitability. Methodological and hardware differences may account for discrepancies across studies. Our findings align with recent reports questioning the robustness of tbTUS-induced facilitation.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "title": "TSLNet: a hierarchical multi-head attention-enabled two-stream LSTM network for accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition",
    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "How are different contrast effects on binocular luster spatially integrated?",
    "content": "In previous studies with dichoptic center-ring-surround stimuli, we found that two properties of the ring element have a strong influence on the phenomenon of binocular luster. The strength of the lustrous impression in the central target patch varies with increasing ring width, with the direction of this variation (increasing or decreasing) depending on the ring's luminance. In this study, we used stimuli in which the ring was split into segments with two different luminances that in uniform rings had opposite effects on perceived luster. The aim was to investigate how the lustrous impression is influenced by combining a weaker and a stronger contrast effect, in particular how they are spatially integrated by the visual system. In a psychophysical matching experiment, subjects had to assess the strength of the lustrous impression in a series of test stimuli with different ring widths, numbers of ring segments, and spatial proportions between the two ring parts. We found that the results of the experiment could neither be explained by a winner-takes-all integration (assuming that the lustrous response is completely determined by the stronger effect) nor by a balanced integration process (assuming equal weights for the two effects). Instead, both effects contribute to the overall lustrous response, with the stronger effect having a greater weight. Interestingly, the magnitude of this weight varied considerably between different groups of subjects. We found two main trends in the data, representing two different types of sensitivity to the phenomenon of binocular luster.",

    "title": "From generative AI to the brain: five takeaways",
    "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "title": "Birth by Cesarean Section Remodels Neonatal Brain Barriers and Associated Immune and Metabolic Pathways in Mice",
    "content": "Mode of delivery shapes early-life physiology through multiple pathways, including stress and hormonal signalling, neonatal oxygenation, and exposure to maternal microbes. Cesarean section (CS) bypasses several of these processes and has been associated with altered immune maturation and neurodevelopmental outcomes in humans and animal models. Given that CS is also known to disrupt gut barrier integrity and that gut and brain barriers operate as a coordinated network, we investigated whether CS-associated changes extend to early postnatal brain barriers. Using a mouse model, we compared CS-delivered pups with vaginally born (VB) controls at postnatal days 8-9. Brain barrier permeability and cellular architecture were assessed using tracer extravasation and vascular and tight junction analysis, choroid plexus immune populations were profiled, and metabolomic profiling was performed in cortex and plasma. Blood-brain barrier structural readouts in the medial prefrontal cortex were mostly preserved. In contrast, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) exhibited structural alterations in both its vascular and epithelial tight junction compartments. These barrier changes were accompanied by immune remodelling, including expansion of antigen-presenting border-associated macrophages and reduced parenchymal microglia density. CS delivery increased brain tracer accumulation, consistent with altered barrier function during this developmental window. Metabolomic profiling further identified lower levels of key brain metabolites, including N-acetylaspartate, a marker of neuronal metabolic state. Together, these findings demonstrate that CS delivery induces early alterations in brain barrier function, BCSFB structure, immune landscape, along with brain and plasma metabolic profiles in mice. This identifies delivery mode as a key perinatal variable shaping neonatal brain physiology and establishes a framework for dissecting how birth context may influence long-term neurodevelopmental trajectories.",

    "content": "Direct binding of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to the TRKB receptor has been revealed as a novel mode of action for SSRIs. However, micromolar SSRI concentrations are required for this interaction to produce measurable effects in vitro and in vivo in animal models. Here, we highlight that measurements of human blood and cerebrospinal fluid from chronically treated patients reveal only nano- to picomolar SSRI levels. Rodent electrophysiological studies show that micromolar SSRI concentrations disrupt multiple ion channel functions, and we demonstrate that exposure of human neurons to micromolar concentrations leads to significantly reduced activity at 1 uM and complete silencing at 10 uM-concentrations required to exert effects by direct SSRI low-affinity binding to TRKB in animals. Together, clinical measurements, animal electrophysiological studies, and our human neuro-electrophysiology data question whether the low SSRI concentrations achieved in patients have any consequences through their low-affinity binding to TRKB receptors. The micromolar concentrations required for effects elicit by SSRI-TRKB direct interaction are not reached under therapeutic conditions and, as our data show, would instead presumably lead to a near-complete loss of neuronal activity in humans.",

    "title": "Nutritional Protection Against Antipsychotic-Related Brain Injury: Combined Omega-3 and Vitamin E Effects on the Cerebellum",
    "content": "Haloperidol is a widely used typical antipsychotic for schizophrenia but is associated with neurotoxic effects mediated by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and neuronal disruption. Omega 3 fatty acids possess anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties while vitamin E is a potent lipid-soluble antioxidant. Although each has shown protective effects individually, their combined efficacy against haloperidol induced cerebellar toxicity remains poorly understood. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of co-administered omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin E on haloperidol induced behavioural biochemical and histological alterations in the rat cerebellum. Sixty male Wistar rats (80 to100 g) were randomly assigned to six groups (n = 10). Control animals received a standard diet and olive oil while treatment groups received omega 3 fatty acids (500 mg/kg of feed), vitamin E (10 IU/kg, orally), haloperidol (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), or their combinations for 28 days. Haloperidol-treated rats showed significant reductions in body weight, feed intake, locomotor activity, rearing, and spatial working memory, alongside increased grooming behaviour and catalepsy (p < 0.05). These behavioural deficits were markedly attenuated by omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E, particularly when administered together. Haloperidol also increased malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha) while reducing total antioxidant capacity, indicating heightened oxidative stress and inflammation. Co-treatment with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E significantly reversed these biochemical alterations. Histological analysis revealed pronounced cerebellar neuronal degeneration in haloperidol-only rats, whereas cerebellar architecture was largely preserved in co-treated groups. Overall, combined omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin E supplementation provided significant neuroprotection against haloperidol-induced cerebellar toxicity and motor impairment, supporting their potential role as adjunct therapies in reducing antipsychotic-related neurodegeneration.",

Or worse - I'd ask the agent to run them and it would start looping: fix tests, those fail, then it starts \"fixing\" my code so tests pass, or just deletes assertions so they \"pass\".<p>Out of that frustration I built KeelTest - a VS Code extension that generates pytest tests and executes them, got hooked and decided to push this project forward... When tests fail, it tries to figure out why:<p>- Generation error: Attemps to fix it automatically, then tries again<p>- Bug in your source code: flags it and explains what's wrong<p>How it works:<p>- Static analysis to map dependencies, patterns, services to mock.<p>- Generate a plan for each function and what edge cases to cover<p>- Generate those tests<p>- Execute in \"sandbox\"<p>- Self-heal failures or flag source bugs<p>Python + pytest only for now. Alpha stage - not all codebases work reliably. But testing on personal projects and a few production apps at work, it's been consistently decent. Works best on simpler applications, sometimes glitches on monorepos setups.

    "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
    "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal Divergence Between Intrinsic And Evoked Cortical Activity Predicts Visual Detection.",
    "content": "The threshold for sensory detection varies with fluctuations in intrinsic cortical activity. When stimulus-encoding cortical populations are more excitable, stimuli elicit stronger neural responses that are more likely to be detected. However, the detection of a stimulus is also more likely when cortical populations are less excitable because there is less background 'noise'. Therefore, it is unclear how the variable states of intrinsic and sensory-evoked cortical activity and their interactions impact sensory detection. We hypothesize the answer depends on the spatiotemporal structure of intrinsic activity states across sensory encoding and non-encoding populations. To test this, we examined intrinsic and target-evoked population activity across cortical Area MT in common marmosets while they performed a threshold visual detection task. We compared detection performance based on target-evoked responses and the state of intrinsic activity in the larger surrounding population. We find that the intrinsic activity in the surrounding, non-encoding population predicted trial-by-trial detection performance better than the population encoding the target evoked response. Furthermore, we find that the detection performance of the monkey was best predicted by the divergence in excitability between the encoding and surrounding non-encoding population. These findings suggest that, rather than a source of noise or irrelevant to sensory processing, the distributed spatiotemporal state of intrinsic activity directly influences how sensory signals are represented in cortical populations and can influence perceptual thresholds in visual detection.",

    "title": "Good dog, bad wolf: Debunking evolutionary preparedness to fear wolves",
    "content": "The return of wolves to historical ranges often causes strong opposition, contrasting with widespread affection for domestic dogs. Evolutionary accounts suggest this discrepancy stems from deeply ingrained affective responses that predispose humans to fear wolves while fostering positive attachment to dogs. Using neuroimaging and self-report data from 42 participants, we investigated how defensive neural circuits linked to implicit threat detection are related to explicit threat evaluations of the two species. During functional MRI, participants viewed images of wolves, dogs, and snakes - the latter chosen for their strong engagement of predisposed threat-related responses - displaying either aggressive or non-aggressive behaviours. As predicted, aggressive displays of all species elicited stronger neural responses in threat-related brain areas. Snakes elicited stronger subcortical threat responses than wolves or dogs, while neural responses to wolves and dogs were largely indistinguishable when comparing aggressive displays. However, explicit threat evaluations strongly differed: wolves were perceived and rated as significantly more threatening than dogs, especially when the species exhibited aggressive displays. Together, these findings challenge accounts that humans are predisposed for negative responses to wolves, suggesting instead that our attitudes towards the species are shaped primarily by deliberate-evaluative processes rather than by implicit-automatic threat responses. This underscores the role of experience, knowledge, stereotypes, and socio-cultural mechanisms in shaping public perceptions of human-wildlife conflicts and conservation efforts. These results provide new insights into the cognitive and affective foundations of human-animal relationships, informing efforts to improve human-wildlife coexistence.",

    "title": "Decoding semantic categories: insights from an fMRI ALE meta analysis",
    "content": "Objective. The human brain organizes conceptual knowledge into semantic categories; however, the extent to which these categories share common or distinct neural representations remains unclear. This study aims to clarify this organizational structure by identifying consistent, modality-controlled activation patterns across several widely used and frequently investigated semantic domains in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research. By quantifying the distinctiveness and overlap among these patterns, we provide a more precise foundation for understanding the brain\u2019s semantic architecture, as well as for applications such as semantic brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCI). Approach. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 75 fMRI studies covering six semantic categories: animals, tools, food, music, body parts, and pain. Using activation likelihood estimation, we identified convergent activation patterns for each category while controlling for stimulus modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and written). Subsequently, Jaccard-based overlap analyses were performed to quantify the degree of neural commonality and separability across concept-modality pairs, thereby revealing the underlying structure of representational similarity. Main results. Distinct yet partially overlapping activation networks were identified for each semantic category. Tools and animals showed shared activity in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal regions, reflecting common object-based visual processing. In contrast, food-related stimuli primarily recruited limbic and subcortical structures associated with affective and motivational processing. Music and animal sounds overlapped within the superior temporal and insular cortices, whereas body parts and pain engaged occipito-parietal and cingulo-insular networks, respectively. Together, these findings reveal a hierarchically organized and modality-dependent semantic architecture in the human brain. Significance. This meta-analysis offers a quantitative and integrative characterization of how semantic knowledge is distributed and differentiated across cortical systems. By demonstrating how conceptual content and sensory modality jointly shape neural organization, the study refines theoretical models of semantic cognition and provides a methodological basis for evaluating conceptual separability. These insights have direct implications for semantic neural decoding and for the development of BCI systems grounded in meaning-based neural representations.",

    "content": "This paper examines the extent to which large language models (LLMs) are able to perform tasks which require higher-order theory of mind (ToM)\u2014the human ability to reason about multiple mental and emotional states in a recursive manner (e.g., I think that you believe that she knows). This paper builds on prior work by introducing a handwritten test suite\u2014Multi-Order Theory of Mind Q&amp;A\u2014and using it to compare the performance of five LLMs of varying sizes and training paradigms to a newly gathered adult human benchmark. We find that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM reach adult-level and near adult-level performance on our ToM tasks overall, and that GPT-4 exceeds adult performance on 6th order inferences. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between model size and finetuning for higher-order ToM performance, and that the linguistic abilities of large models may support more complex ToM inferences. Given the important role that higher-order ToM plays in group social interaction and relationships, these findings have significant implications for the development of a broad range of social, educational and assistive LLM applications.",

    "title": "Placental Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Deficiency Drives Autism-Relevant Behavioral Changes with Sex-Specific Vulnerabilities",
    "content": "Preterm birth and other perinatal adversities lead to loss of placental support including critical hormones, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), required for neurodevelopment. Decreased IGF1 and preterm birth are associated with neurodevelopmental disorder risk, including autism spectrum disorder. Whether placental Igf1 insufficiency impacts these neurodevelopmental risks is not understood. To understand these mechanisms, placental-targeted CRISPR manipulation in mice was employed to create placental Igf1 insufficiency. Subsequently, embryonic forebrain development was assessed sex-specifically to identify structural and transcriptomic changes. Postnatal offspring were used to determine neurobehavioral trajectories relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders as assessed through learning, motor, and affective behavioral tasks and neurostereology. Placental Igf1 insufficiency reduced embryonic forebrain growth, including decreased cell population across males and females. Embryonic forebrain transcriptomics revealed sex-specific alterations. Autism relevant developmental pathways were downregulated in male forebrain, driven by genes including Reln and Lama1. Altered genes in female forebrain were enriched for autism-risk genes including Grin2b and Dync1h1. Following these transcriptomic differences, postnatal neurobehavioral trajectories were sex specific. Male offspring uniquely showed reduced motor learning, increased stereotyped behaviors, altered reversal learning, and reduced forebrain neuronal number. Female offspring displayed opposite behavioral changes as males and few changes in forebrain structure. The provision of Igf1 specifically from placenta is critical for offspring forebrain development. This temporary early deficit has persistent sex-specific neurobehavioral effects. These outcomes have relevance for autism risk and highlight mechanisms that could facilitate intervention development for adverse outcomes after early loss of placental hormone support in perinatal adversity.",

    "title": "Cortical deviance detection represents a canonical difference signal",
    "content": "Context modulates neural processing of sensory stimuli. Neural responses are suppressed to stimuli that are typical in their context and augmented to stimuli that deviate from their context. The latter has been conceptualized as a prediction error, which can serve to enhance the salience, direct attention, or support learning about behaviorally relevant events. Predictive coding theories posit that prediction errors act to signal the difference between internal predictions and actual sensory input, yet most paradigms simultaneously alter both predictions and input, so cannot test for a true difference signal. Increased neural responses to deviants could, instead, encode generalized surprise or augmented bottom-up signaling. Here we compare neural responses to auditory stimuli across oddball paradigm variants. We found that responses of putative excitatory neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) to auditory deviants contain frequency change information and a memory trace of contextual information. Interestingly, in a fixed-deviant oddball paradigm where predictions are altered but deviant input remains constant, neural response patterns encoded standard-to-deviant frequency difference. These results support the interpretation that A1 deviance detection can be interpreted as a sensory prediction error that represents the difference between prediction and sensory input, a corollary of the predictive coding framework.",

    "title": "Microglial Lag3 Drives \u03b1-Synuclein--induced Neurotoxic Activated (A1) Astrocytes and Neurodegeneration",
    "content": "Background Neuroinflammation and pathologic -synuclein (-syn) aggregation cooperate to drive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, but the glial receptors that couple extracellular -syn to inflammatory cascades remain incompletely defined. Microglia express higher levels of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3) than neurons, yet the contribution of microglial Lag3 to -syn recognition, glial crosstalk, and neurodegeneration is unknown. Methods Biochemical binding assays, live-cell imaging, cytokine profiling, and neuron-microglia-astrocyte co-culture paradigms were used to define Lag3-dependent -syn preformed fibril (PFF) binding, uptake, and microglial activation. To interrogate in vivo function, microglia-specific Lag3 conditional knockout mice (Lag3L/L-Cx3cr1CreER) and littermate controls received unilateral intrastriatal -syn PFF injections, followed by histological, biochemical, and behavioral assessments of -syn pathology, gliosis, nigrostriatal integrity, and motor performance. Results -syn PFFs bound microglial Lag3 with high specificity and nanomolar affinity and required Lag3 for efficient fibril internalization and induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Microglial Lag3 deficiency markedly blunted -syn PFF-evoked microglial activation, prevented cytokine-driven conversion of astrocytes into neurotoxic reactive A1 astrocytes, and abolished astrocyte-dependent neuronal death in vitro. In vivo, microglia-specific Lag3 deletion reduced cortical, striatal, and substantia nigra pS129 -syn pathology, suppressed microgliosis and A1 astrocyte induction, preserved substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine transporter/tyrosine hydroxylase expression, and ameliorated -syn PFF-induced motor deficits. Conclusions This study identifies microglial Lag3 as a key receptor linking extracellular -syn PFF recognition to inflammatory amplification, neurotoxic reactive A1 astrocyte conversion, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Together with prior work on neuronal Lag3, these findings support a cell-type-specific dual-axis model in which neuronal Lag3 mediates -syn propagation while microglial Lag3 drives glia-dependent neurotoxicity, positioning Lag3 as a promising precision therapeutic target in -synucleinopathies.",

    "title": "Disrupted maternal care alters neural-microglia interactions in the primate paralaminar (PL) nucleus of the amygdala.",
    "content": "Prolonged postnatal maturation of the primate amygdala is thought to be driven, at least partially, by continued neural maturation within the paralaminar nucleus (PL). At birth, the PL is densely populated with post-mitotic glutamatergic neurons that gradually mature throughout postnatal life. This active process is likely supported by microglia, which promotes synaptic maturation. Our previous work showed that early life stress associated with maternal separation alters microglia development across the infant to adolescent transition. Here, we examined whether these morphologic microglial changes are associated with alterations in the numbers of pre-synaptic terminals (SYN1+ puncta), post-synaptic terminals (PSD95+ puncta), and putative excitatory contacts (SYN1-PSD95 colocalization), and whether these synaptic elements are engulfed by phagocytic microglia. In maternally reared animals, SYN1+ puncta, PSD95+ puncta, and putative synaptic contacts decreased, while microglial (IBA1+) volume, CD68+ content, and engulfment of synaptic elements increased, between infancy and adolescence. These findings suggest greater pruning of all synaptic elements by adolescence. Maternal separation altered this trajectory, resulting in increased phagocytic activity and engulfment of synaptic elements in infancy, but not in adolescence. Maternal separation also resulted in a 50% reduction in mature PL neurons by adolescence, suggesting maturational failure, cell loss, or both by adolescence. These findings demonstrate that early life stress disrupts normative synaptic pruning and microglia-synapse interactions in the developing primate PL. Increased synaptic engulfment in infants with disrupted care is associated with premature, aberrant pruning, and highlights a potential cellular mechanism through which early environmental insults could change PL neural development by adolescence.",

    "title": "Adaptation response to pitch shift during speech is attenuated upon relearning",
    "content": "IntroductionDuring sensorimotor adaptation, participants respond to a persistent sensory error by shifting behavior to oppose the error. This phenomenon has been measured in multiple motor tasks in which sensory feedback is experimentally altered to artificially introduce an error. Tasks involving multiple cycles of altered and unaltered feedback have been used in the arm reaching domain to understand the mechanisms of un-learning and re-learning a response to an error, but re-learning within a single session has not been studied in the domain of fundamental frequency (f0) control during speech.MethodsIn this study, participants responded to three alternating blocks of f0-shifted and unshifted auditory feedback during a single-word speech task.ResultsIt was found that on average, adaptation magnitude decreased in the second and third blocks of shifted feedback compared to the first. This illustrates an attenuation effect similar to that observed in studies of implicit learning in arm reaching tasks.DiscussionThese results support the understanding of f0 control as an implicit learning phenomenon and help place f0 control in the context of motor control in general.",

    "title": "Pattern-induced visual discomfort and its cumulative effects revealed by pupillary measures",
    "content": "IntroductionViewing repetitive striped patterns can induce pattern glare, experienced as visual discomfort (VD). While previous studies examined either pupillary responses or VD separately, few have investigated how they covary or evolve with repeated exposure. This study tested whether pupillary dynamics could serve as potential physiological indicator of individual visual sensitivity beyond subjective reports.MethodsAcross four experiments (preliminary: n = 97; main: n = 70 for spatial frequency, n = 46 for central field size, n = 36 for central blank, with partial overlap), we manipulated spatial frequency, central field size, and surround field size of square-wave gratings (0.5\u20133 s) while measuring both discomfort and pupil size.ResultsHigher spatial frequencies and larger pattern areas elicited stronger pupillary constriction and greater discomfort, whereas repeated exposures produced cumulative increases in discomfort and decreases in baseline pupil size, consistent with visual strain rather than adaptation. To assess the potential of pupillometry as an indicator of visual discomfort, we examined individual differences in the main spatial-frequency experiment (controlled viewing distance, n = 42). A paradoxical pattern emerged: within participants, stronger stimuli produced greater constriction, but individuals with higher overall discomfort showed weaker constriction and stronger late redilation. Similar dissociations between subjective sensitivity and pupillary responses have been noted in studies of light-induced discomfort, suggesting that related mechanisms may contribute, although their specific physiological basis remains unclear.DiscussionOverall, our findings clarify how pattern-induced discomfort evolves over time and across individuals and highlight pupillometry's potential as a sensitive, physiological tool for assessing visual sensitivity.",

    "title": "The association of hemoglobin levels and balance function in patients with stroke: a multicenter study in China",
    "content": "BackgroundBalance impairment following stroke is a leading cause of disability and falls. Hemoglobin (Hb) affects systemic and cerebral oxygen delivery and may influence neuromuscular function and post-stroke balance, but evidence from large multicenter clinical samples is limited. We investigated the association between hemoglobin concentration and balance performance in a Chinese multicenter cross-sectional study of stroke patients.MethodsWe studied 2,006 neuroimaging-confirmed stroke patients from 26 hospitals. Balance impairment was defined as BBS\u202f\u2264\u202f40. Admission Hb (g/dL) was analyzed per 1\u202fg/dL and by tertiles (<12.6\u202fg/dL, 12.6\u201314.0\u202fg/dL, \u226514.0\u202fg/dL). Multivariable logistic regression with sequential adjustment, restricted cubic splines, and prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses evaluated associations.ResultsBalance impairment occurred in 70.5% (1,414/2,006). Each 1\u202fg/dL higher Hb was associated with lower odds of impairment in unadjusted (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78\u20130.87; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and fully adjusted models (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83\u20130.96; p\u202f=\u202f0.002). This association remained robust after comprehensive adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, stroke characteristics, and lesion location factors. Compared with the lowest tertile, adjusted ORs were 0.72 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.99; p\u202f=\u202f0.042) for the middle tertile and 0.62 (95% CI 0.45\u20130.85; p\u202f=\u202f0.003) for the highest tertile. Spline analyses suggested a broadly linear inverse association; results were consistent across subgroups and sensitivity checks.ConclusionHigher admission hemoglobin was independently associated with better balance after stroke. Prospective studies should test whether Hb optimization improves rehabilitation outcomes.",

    "title": "Neural correlation between swallowing motor imagery and execution: an EEG analysis",
    "content": "Objective. The relationship between swallowing motor imagery (MI) and actual swallowing remains unclear, leading to a lack of physiological basis for the application of swallowing imagery-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) paradigms in rehabilitation. This research explored the link between swallowing execution and imagery, aiming to optimize BCI applications for swallowing rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia. Approach. Thirty healthy participants performed swallowing MI and saliva swallowing tasks under video cues, and electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 64 channels and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the suprahyoid muscles were recorded. This study investigates swallowing onset detection using EMG, and explores neural dynamics during swallowing imagery and execution through EEG-based time\u2013frequency analysis, functional connectivity analysis, and nonlinear dynamic analysis (sample entropy (SampEn)). Main Results. The results revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the central region (CPz, CP1\u2013CP4) and parietal region (Pz, P1\u2013P4) for both swallowing MI and actual swallowing. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis indicated a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0102). The ERD phenomenon during swallowing imagery was more similar to that during the pharyngeal stage, with a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0139). Functional connectivity analysis revealed greater activation of the central region during swallowing imagery than during actual swallowing. In terms of SampEn, swallowing motor execution exhibited higher signal complexity and dynamic characteristics compared to imagery. Significance. This study highlights the similarity in neural activation between swallowing imagery and execution, particularly in the central and parietal regions, supporting the application of the swallowing imagery paradigm in these regions for rehabilitation.

    "content": "This perspective article explores the transformative potential of brain\u2013Computer Interfaces (BCI) in undergraduate systems engineering programs, a domain characterized by high attrition and a widening gap between rapid technological innovation and slower pedagogical change. I argue that BCI, by enabling real-time detection of cognitive states such as mental workload, attention, and frustration, can evolve from laboratory tools to central pedagogical instruments for adaptive, student-centered education. I review the state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrate the technical feasibility of low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) devices and machine learning algorithms that classify cognitive states with high accuracy in controlled settings. Building on this evidence, I outline concrete applications in three dimensions: formative assessment, dynamic curricular adaptation, and cognitive inclusion, with a specific emphasis on preventing dropout in foundational courses such as algorithms. I also examine ethical, technical, and pedagogical challenges, and propose a scalable, ethically grounded pilot model tailored for universities, particularly in Latin America. This study reports no empirical results. It synthesizes the existing evidence and proposes a roadmap for research and educational action.",

    "title": "Humans optimally integrate cutaneous and proprioceptive cues in haptic size perception",
    "content": "Sensory perception relies on the brain's integration of multiple imprecise inputs, a process known as cue combination. Previous research has investigated multisensory integration or unisensory integration within non-haptic senses. In contrast, cue combination within the sense of touch has been understudied. Here, we investigated whether humans optimally combine haptic cutaneous and finger configuration cues when discerning the size of a disk held edge-on between the thumb and index fingers. When these two fingers span the disk to contact its perimeter, a finger configuration cue (the perceived distance between the fingers) provides information about the disk's size. Less obviously, cutaneous cues to disk size may result from the indentation of finger pads caused by the disk's curvature. We considered three hypotheses for how humans might use these cues: they might rely solely on the most reliable cue (Winner-Take-All Model, WTA), combine cues based on a simple arithmetic average (Average Model, AVG), or combine cues via an optimal weighted average (Optimal Model, OPT) in which more reliable cues exert proportionately greater influence on the percept. In three experiments involving 34 participants, we compared participant performance to the predictions of the three models. Each experiment tested participants using a two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) paradigm with 3D printed disk stimuli. On each trial, under occluded vision, participants felt two disks sequentially and responded which felt larger. Participants were tested with the cutaneous index finger cue, cutaneous thumb cue, and finger configuration cue individually and with the three cues together. The three experiments were designed to have progressively greater resolution to distinguish the relevant models from one another. In Experiments 1 and 2, the disks were circular. Experiment 3 included non-circular cue-conflict stimuli. The improvement of accuracy in multi-cue conditions, and perceptual effects of cue-conflict stimuli, were broadly consistent with optimal cue combination. Eight of 12 participants were classified as OPT in Experiment 1; eight of 11 in Experiment 2; and 10 of 11 in Experiment 3. The mean confidence of OPT classifications was 0.56, 0.61, and 0.98, respectively. We conclude that humans combine haptic cues optimally to judge the sizes of held objects.",

    "content": "Founders of quantum mechanics (QM) anticipated that revisions to classical physics due to strange elements of quantum reality, would necessitate similar changes in biology. Complexity theory, systems biology and quantum biology provide possible solutions indicating that subject/object separation is a useful fiction for reductive science. Direct correlates to such QM observational/measurement issues as Complementarity and Uncertainty may justify the introduction of an analog of Heisenberg's uncertainty and the Planck constant for living systems. The phase space of \u201cadjacent possibles\u201d for biological systems from which one \u201cactual\u201d is selected resembles the collapse of the QM wave function. Since biological systems are hierarchical, this occurs across organizational scales resulting in biological coherence. The location of a quantum/classical boundary is unclear due to complexity. Whether biological systems' characteristics arise directly from QM or are of a different origin remains unsettled. To combine non-linear with quantum properties across biological scales we propose the Method of Coherent Structures (MCS), developed for quantum many-body systems. In MCS, a higher-level scale provides a classical envelope for quantum fluctuations at the lower scale. It yields a seamless transition from non-linear classical fields to quantum excitations and accounts for the emergence of complexity by incorporating metabolic energy supply.",

    "content": "The pathological basis underlying mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced long-term cognitive impairment is not fully understood. It is supposed that mTBI induces residential microglia activation rather than peripheral leukocyte infiltration to promote neuroinflammation, thus triggering myelin damage as well as cognitive impairment. The transformation of microglia towards a pro-inflammatory (M1 type) or anti-inflammatory (M2 type) state is critical for restraining the cerebral inflammatory response to acute or chronic insults. In addition to classical M1- and M2-like phenotypes, a specific subgroup of microglia, which is referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM), the transition of which is regulated by triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2), is also demonstrated to play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases sharing similar pathological procedures to mTBI. The expression and function of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in microglia vary depending on the type and severity of the specific pathological stimuli. In the current study, we investigated whether peripheral leukocytes infiltrated the brain following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) using a CX3CR1- and CCR2-double transgenic reporter mouse model. We also examined whether M1- or M2-like microglia exhibited a disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype after mTBI, as indicated by their Trem2 expression. Then we explored the expression of p75NTR in M1- and M2-like phenotype microglia after mTBI and its modulating effects on the activation of Trem2 positive M1- and M2-like phenotype microglia, neuroinflammatory reaction, myelin damage, and cognitive performance. We found that most of the activated residential microglia after mTBI were Trem2 positive and p75NTR expression was significantly elevated in Trem2-positive M1-type microglia post-mTBI, correlating with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine release, demyelination, and cognitive deficits. Pharmacological blockade of p75NTR using the antagonist TAT-Pep5 suppressed M1 microglial activation, reduced neuroinflammation, and restored myelin integrity, leading to marked improvements in cognitive function. Mechanistically, p75NTR exhibited a cell-type-specific regulatory role in neuroinflammatory responses, potentially through interacting with Trem2 to modulate DAM-like microglia activation. These findings highlight p75NTR as a key mediator of mTBI-induced neuropathology and propose its inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate secondary neuroinflammation and cognitive decline.",

    "content": "IntroductionBuratti-Harel syndrome (BURHAS) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by SIAH1 (Siah1 E3 ubiquitin ligase) variants, characterized by infantile hypotonia, global developmental delay, and variable multisystem involvement. To date, 13 pathogenic SIAH1 variants have been reported in 13 patients, but the functional and phenotypic implications of mutations in the SIAH1 zinc finger domain remain poorly characterized. This study included a Chinese pediatric patient with unexplained neurodevelopmental and multisystem abnormalities.MethodsTrio whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify potential causative variants. Structural modeling was used to analyze the impact of the identified variant on SIAH1 protein structure. Additionally, a comparative genotype-phenotype analysis was conducted on 14 genetically confirmed BURHAS cases (including the present patient).ResultsA de novo missense variant [c.288C > G (p.Phe96Leu)] in the zinc finger domain of SIAH1 was identified in the patient. Structural modeling revealed that this variant destabilized the zinc finger domain (DDG = \u20132.09 kcal/mol), which may disrupt the ZnF-1 domain function by impairing zinc ion-mediated structural stability. Comparative analysis of 14 genetically confirmed cases (including this study) demonstrated a genotype-phenotype correlation: zinc finger domain variants (n = 4) exhibited broader phenotypic heterogeneity compared to RING domain variants (n = 7), which were enriched for severe developmental delay and reproductive anomalies.DiscussionThis study expands the mutational spectrum of SIAH1-associated disorders. We advocate for the inclusion of SIAH1 in diagnostic panels for patients with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders and multisystem dysmorphisms.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.03023v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Medical conversational AI (AI) plays a pivotal role in the development of safer and more effective medical dialogue systems. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks for assessing the information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning abilities of medical large language models (LLMs) have not been rigorously evaluated. To address these gaps, we present MedDialogRubrics, a novel benchmark comprising 5,200 synthetically constructed patient cases and over 60,000 fine-grained evaluation rubrics generated by LLMs and subsequently refined by clinical experts, specifically designed to assess the multi-turn diagnostic capabilities of LLM. Our framework employs a multi-agent system to synthesize realistic patient records and chief complaints from underlying disease knowledge without accessing real-world electronic health records, thereby mitigating privacy and data-governance concerns. We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases. Furthermore, we propose a structured LLM-based and expert-annotated rubric-generation pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines and utilizes the reject sampling to derive a prioritized set of rubric items (\"must-ask\" items) for each case. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that, across multiple assessment dimensions, current models face substantial challenges. Our results indicate that improving medical dialogue will require advances in dialogue management architectures, not just incremental tuning of the base-model.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.02559v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Despite growing awareness of ethical challenges in software development, practitioners still lack structured tools that help them critically engage with the lived experiences of marginalized users. This paper presents PerspectiveCoach, a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational tool designed to guide developers through structured perspective-taking exercises and deepen critical reflection on how software design decisions affect marginalized communities. Through a controlled study with 18 front-end developers (balanced by sex), who interacted with the tool using a real case of online gender-based harassment, we examine how PerspectiveCoach supports ethical reasoning and engagement with user perspectives. Qualitative analysis revealed increased self-awareness, broadened perspectives, and more nuanced ethical articulation, while a complementary human-human study contextualized these findings. Text similarity analyses demonstrated that participants in the human-PerspectiveCoach study improved the fidelity of their restatements over multiple attempts, capturing both surface-level and semantic aspects of user concerns. However, human-PerspectiveCoach's restatements had a lower baseline than the human-human conversations, highlighting contextual differences in impersonal and interpersonal perspective-taking. Across the study, participants rated the tool highly for usability and relevance. This work contributes an exploratory design for LLM-powered end-user perspective-taking that supports critical, ethical self-reflection and offers empirical insights (i.e., enhancing adaptivity, centering plurality) into how such tools can help practitioners build more inclusive and socially responsive technologies.",

    "title": "Wait or cross? Understanding the influence of behavioral tendency, trust, and risk perception on pedestrian gap-acceptance of automated truck platoons",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.03225v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Although automated trucks have the potential to improve freight efficiency, reduce costs, and address driver shortages, organizing two or more trucks in a convoy has raised considerable concerns for pedestrian safety. This study conducted a controlled experiment to examine the influence of behavioral tendency, trust, and risk perception on pedestrian intention to cross in front of an automated truck platoon. A total of 603 subjects participated in the virtual reality video-based questionnaire survey. By fusing the merits of structural equation modeling and artificial neural networks, a two-stage, hybrid model was developed to examine complex relationships between latent variables and gap-acceptance behaviors. Our results indicated that subjects watched an average of five vehicle gaps before starting crossing and the average time gap accepted was about 5.35 seconds. Risk perception not only played the most dominant role in shaping pedestrian crossing decisions, but also served as the strong bone, mediating the effects of behavioral tendency and trust on gap-acceptance. Participants who frequently violated traffic rules were more likely to accept a smaller time gap, while those who showed positive behaviors to other road users tended to wait for a larger time gap. Participants who often committed errors, showed aggressive behaviors, and held greater trust in the safety of automated trucks generally reported a lower level of risk for road-crossing in front of automated truck platoons. Built on these findings, a range of tailored countermeasures were proposed to ensure safer and smother interactions between pedestrians and automated truck platoons.",

    "title": "Are eHMIs always helpful? Investigating how eHMIs interfere with pedestrian behavior on multi-lane streets: An eye-tracking virtual reality experiment",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.03223v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Appropriate communication is crucial for efficient and safe interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles (AVs). External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on AVs, which can be categorized as allocentric or egocentric, are considered a promising solution. While the effectiveness of eHMIs has been extensively studied, in complex environments, such as unsignalized multi-lane streets, their potential to interfere with pedestrian crossing behavior remains underexplored. Hence, a virtual reality-based experiment was conducted to examine how different types of eHMIs displayed on AVs affect the crossing behavior of pedestrians in multi-lane streets environments, with a focus on the gaze patterns of pedestrians during crossing. The results revealed that the presence of eHMIs significantly influenced the cognitive load on pedestrians and increased the possibility of distraction, even misleading pedestrians in cases involving multiple AVs on multi-lane streets. Notably, allocentric eHMIs induced higher cognitive loads and greater distraction in pedestrians than egocentric eHMIs. This was primarily evidenced by longer gaze time and higher proportions of attention for the eHMI on the interacting vehicle, as well as a broader distribution of gaze toward vehicles in the non-interacting lane. However, misleading behavior was mainly triggered by eHMI signals from yielding vehicles in the non-interacting lane. Under such asymmetric signal configurations, egocentric eHMIs resulted in a higher misjudgment rate than allocentric eHMIs. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing eHMI designs to balance the clarity and consistency of the displayed information across different perspectives, especially in complex multi-lane traffic scenarios. This study provides valuable insights regarding the application and standardization of future eHMI systems for AVs.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.03218v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Autonomous driving improves traffic efficiency but presents safety challenges in complex port environments. This study investigates how environmental factors, traffic factors, and pedestrian characteristics influence interaction safety between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians in ports. Using virtual reality (VR) simulations of typical port scenarios, 33 participants completed pedestrian crossing tasks under varying visibility, vehicle sizes, and time pressure conditions. Results indicate that low-visibility conditions, partial occlusions and larger vehicle sizes significantly increase perceived risk, prompting pedestrians to wait longer and accept larger gaps. Specifically, pedestrians tended to accept larger gaps and waited longer when interacting with large autonomous truck platoons, reflecting heightened caution due to their perceived threat. However, local obstructions also reduce post-encroachment time, compressing safety margins. Individual attributes such as age, gender, and driving experience further shape decision-making, while time pressure undermines compensatory behaviors and increases risk. Based on these findings, safety strategies are proposed, including installing wide-angle cameras at multiple viewpoints, enabling real-time vehicle-infrastructure communication, enhancing port lighting and signage, and strengthening pedestrian safety training. This study offers practical recommendations for improving the safety and deployment of vision-based autonomous systems in port settings.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.02829v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Extended reality (XR) is evolving into a general-purpose computing platform, yet its adoption for productivity is hindered by visual fatigue and simulator sickness. While these symptoms are often attributed to latency or motion conflicts, the precise impact of textual clarity on physiological comfort remains undefined. Here we show that sub-optimal effective resolution, the clarity that reaches the eye after the full display-optics-rendering pipeline, is a primary driver of simulator sickness during reading tasks in both virtual reality and video see-through environments. By systematically manipulating end-to-end effective resolution on a unified logMAR scale, we measured reading psychophysics and sickness symptoms in a controlled within-subjects study. We find that reading performance and user comfort degrade exponentially as resolution drops below 0 logMAR (normal visual acuity). Notably, our results reveal 0 logMAR as a key physiological tipping point: resolutions better than this threshold yield naked-eye-level performance with minimal sickness, whereas poorer resolutions trigger rapid, non-linear increases in nausea and oculomotor strain. These findings suggest that the cognitive and perceptual effort required to resolve blurry text directly compromises user comfort, establishing human-eye resolution as a critical baseline for the design of future ergonomic XR systems.",

While these systems are promoted as efficient and consistent, they also generate new forms of uncertainty for applicants. Efforts to soften these experiences through human-like design features have only partially addressed underlying concerns. To understand how candidates interpret and cope with such systems, we conducted a mixed empirical investigation that combined analysis of online discussions, responses from more than one hundred and fifty survey participants, and follow-up conversations with seventeen interviewees. The findings point to several recurring problems, including unclear evaluation criteria, limited organizational responsibility for automated outcomes, and a lack of practical support for preparation. Many participants described the technology as far less advanced than advertised, leading them to infer how decisions might be made in the absence of guidance. This speculation often intensified stress and emotional strain. Furthermore, the minimal sense of interpersonal engagement contributed to feelings of detachment and disposability. Based on these observations, we propose design directions aimed at improving clarity, accountability, and candidate support in AI-mediated hiring processes.",

We conducted a large-scale survey (n = 1001) in Dubai to explore acceptance of sixteen capability enhancement scenarios within these domains. The highest levels of agreement were observed for multilingual communication (77.5%) and learning capabilities (68.7%), followed by assisting individuals with reduced mobility (64.5%) and behavioral transformation (59.5%).

Interestingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the image-by-image correlation between the decoded decisions based on the internal neural representations in a classification task. Thus, it can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate DVC using monkey V4/IT recordings and network models trained on image classification tasks. We find that model-model similarity is comparable to monkey-monkey similarity, whereas model-monkey similarity is consistently lower. Strikingly, DVC decreases with increasing network performance on ImageNet-1k. Adversarial training does not improve model-monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions assessed using DVC, although it markedly increases the model-model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model-monkey similarity. These results suggest a divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.",

Models often rely on fine-tuning connectivity to match empirical data, which may limit biological plausibility. Here we propose a physiologically grounded alternative where receptive fields and population-level attractor dynamics arise naturally from the effective hyperbolic geometry of scale-free networks. By associating stimulus space with the boundary of a hyperbolic embedding, we simulate neural dynamics using rate-based and spiking models, revealing localized activity patterns that reflect stimulus space structure without synaptic fine-tuning. The resulting receptive fields follow experimentally observed statistics and properties, and their sizes depends on neuron's connectivity degree. The model generalizes across stimuli dimensionalities and various modalities, such as orientation and place selectivity. Experimental analyses of hippocampal place fields recorded on a linear track support these findings. This framework offers a novel organizing principle linking network structure, stimulus space encoding, and neural dynamics, providing insights into receptive field formation across diverse brain areas.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.02885v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Defining agency is an extremely important challenge for cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between them and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism has been debated. Although we have already proposed a physical \"agent determinism\" model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, a sequence of indices that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.02636v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Credit assignment--how changes in individual neurons and synapses affect a network's output--is central to learning in brains and machines. Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale.",

A key challenge in addressing this question is that transformers and brains are trained on fundamentally different data. Brains are initially \"trained\" on prenatal sensory experiences (e.g., retinal waves), whereas transformers are typically trained on large datasets that are not biologically plausible. We reasoned that if transformers learn like brains, then they should develop the same structure as newborn brains when exposed to the same prenatal data. To test this prediction, we simulated prenatal visual input using a retinal wave generator. Then, using self-supervised temporal learning, we trained transformers to adapt to those retinal waves. During training, the transformers spontaneously developed the same structure as newborn visual systems: (1) early layers became sensitive to edges, (2) later layers became sensitive to shapes, and (3) the models developed larger receptive fields across layers. The organization of newborn visual systems emerges spontaneously when transformers adapt to a prenatal visual world. This developmental convergence suggests that brains and transformers learn in common ways and follow the same general fitting principles.",

To reconcile this, we trained biologically constrained deep networks, based on scale-invariant hippocampal time cells, on a language classification task mimicking the hierarchical structure of language (e.g., 'letters' forming 'words'). First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales. These results suggest the brain employs scale-invariant, sequential priors - coding \"what\" happened \"when\" - making recurrent networks with such priors particularly well-suited to describe human cognition.",

    "title": "gPC-based robustness analysis of neural systems through probabilistic recurrence metrics",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.02606v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neuronal systems often preserve their characteristic functions and signalling patterns, also referred to as regimes, despite parametric uncertainties and variations. For neural models having uncertain parameters with a known probability distribution, probabilistic robustness analysis (PRA) allows us to understand and quantify under which uncertainty conditions a regime is preserved in expectation. We introduce a new computational framework for the efficient and systematic PRA of dynamical systems in neuroscience and we show its efficacy in analysing well-known neural models that exhibit multiple dynamical regimes: the Hindmarsh-Rose model for single neurons and the Jansen-Rit model for cortical columns. Given a model subject to parametric uncertainty, we employ generalised polynomial chaos to derive mean neural activity signals, which are then used to assess the amount of parametric uncertainty that the system can withstand while preserving the current regime, thereby quantifying the regime's robustness to such uncertainty. To assess persistence of regimes, we propose new metrics, which we apply to recurrence plots obtained from the mean neural activity signals. The overall result is a novel, general computational methodology that combines recurrence plot analysis and systematic persistence analysis to assess how much the uncertain model parameters can vary, with respect to their nominal value, while preserving the nominal regimes in expectation. We summarise the PRA results through probabilistic regime preservation (PRP) plots, which capture the effect of parametric uncertainties on the robustness of dynamical regimes in the considered models.",

This individual uniqueness not only makes life more interesting, but it also increases our collective ability to handle a wide range of ideas and problems.</p>\n<p>Despite these capabilities, our differences can also lead to an overwhelming feeling of division in some. Differences often lead to disagreement, anger, hostility, or violence. To say humans don't often inflict cruelty on one another would be a lie. We absolutely have shown our teeth. In innumerable ways, we've caused horror to our own species. We've dehumanized, caused suffering, and in many cases killed one another.</p>\n<p>In many ways, we're still learning. Humanity is still growing. A lot of people are trying to sort right from wrong, fair from unfair, true from untrue. This leads to a lot of confusion, a lot of chaos, and a lot of violence. To see humans go after other humans in such efficient and relentless manners is terrifying and beyond disheartening. It can be easy to lose hope, but the truth is... <em>none of it is necessary.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>None of the violence, none of the hate, none of the inequality is mandatory.</strong></em></p>\n<p>We are allowed to go against the grain of things we know are wrong. <em>We are allowed to improve our world.</em> Never be scared to do what you know is right, even when its hard, even when it might benefit someone else more than yourself. Match relentless selfishness with your own relentless generosity. Resist chaos and confusion with serenity and understanding. Engulf violence with endless harmony.</p>\n<p>Remember that truth doesn't rely on anyone. Truth doesn't ask for our opinions. Truth is eternal, unwavering, and it will always be there, waiting for us to realize what we're capable of together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;<em><strong>In this world there\u2019s room for everyone and the good earth is rich, and can provide for everyone.

We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. <em><strong>More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.

They can use it to easily scan text from images.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong><br /> With other OCR text scanners you need to manually save the image and upload it for scan. But this tool allows you to scan text like a snipping tool.</p> <p>It is free and open-source. Currently available for Windows as &quot;.exe&quot; (GitHub repo has build instructions in case anyone wants to compile it from source).</p> <p>I will be improving it in the future making it more accurate and cross-platform.</p> <p>GitHub Repository Link (Star if you find it helpful!):<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/Nabir14/oclip\">https://github.com/Nabir14/oclip</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nabir140\"> /u/Nabir140 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q5ia6n/oclip_copy_text_from_image_directly/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q5ia6n/oclip_copy_text_from_image_directly/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone! I've just released <strong><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/cf-taskpool/\">cf-taskpool</a></strong>, a Python 3.11+ library that brings the familiar <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>/<code>ProcessPoolExecutor</code> API to asyncio coroutines. In fact it's not just the API: both the implementation and the tests are based on stdlib's <code>concurrent.futures</code>, avoiding garbage collection memory leaks and tricky edge cases that more naive implementations would run into.</p> <p>Also, 100% organic, human-written code: no AI slop here, just good old-fashioned caffeine-fueled programming.</p> <p>Would love to hear your feedback!</p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p><code>cf-taskpool</code> provides <code>TaskPoolExecutor</code>, which lets you execute async coroutines using a pool of asyncio tasks with controlled concurrency. It implements the same API you already know from <code>concurrent.futures</code>, but returns <code>asyncio.Future</code> objects that work seamlessly with <code>asyncio.wait()</code>, <code>asyncio.as_completed()</code>, and <code>asyncio.gather()</code>.</p> <p><strong>Quick example:</strong></p> <p>```python import asyncio from cf_taskpool import TaskPoolExecutor</p> <p>async def fetch_data(url: str) -&gt; str: await asyncio.sleep(0.1) return f&quot;Data from {url}&quot;</p> <p>async def main(): async with TaskPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor: future = await executor.submit(fetch_data, &quot;<a href=\"https://example.com%22\">https://example.com&quot;</a>) result = await future print(result)</p> <p>asyncio.run(main()) ```</p> <p>It also includes a <code>map()</code> method that returns an async iterator with optional buffering for memory-efficient processing of large iterables.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>This library is for Python developers who:</p> <ul> <li>Need to limit concurrency when running multiple async operations</li> <li>Want a clean, familiar API instead of managing semaphores manually</li> <li>Are already comfortable with <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>/<code>ProcessPoolExecutor</code> and want the same interface for async code</li> <li>Need to integrate task pools with existing asyncio utilities like <code>wait()</code> and <code>as_completed()</code></li> </ul> <p>If you're working with async/await and need backpressure or concurrency control, this might be useful.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p><strong>vs. <code>asyncio.Semaphore</code> or <code>asyncio.Queue</code>:</strong> These are great for simple cases where you create all tasks upfront and don't need backpressure. However, they require more manual orchestration. Chek out these links for context: - <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48483348/how-to-limit-concurrency-with-python-asyncio\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48483348/how-to-limit-concurrency-with-python-asyncio</a> - <a href=\"https://death.andgravity.com/limit-concurrency\">https://death.andgravity.com/limit-concurrency</a></p> <p><strong>vs. existing task pool libraries:</strong> There are a couple libraries that attempt to solve this (async-pool, async-pool-executor, asyncio-pool, asyncio-taskpool, asynctaskpool, etc.), but most are unmaintained and have ad-hoc APIs. <code>cf-taskpool</code> instead uses the standard <code>concurrent.futures</code> interface.</p> <h2>Links</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/cf-taskpool/\">PyPI</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/gsakkis/cf-taskpool\">GitHub</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/void-null-pointer\"> /u/void-null-pointer </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q5jual/cftaskpool_a_concurrentfuturesstyle_pool_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q5jual/cftaskpool_a_concurrentfuturesstyle_pool_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Treat the circuit as an executable function and train a tiny ReLU network (\"surrogate\") that exactly matches the circuit on all inputs in a bounded domain (typically sequences of length 5\u201310 over a small token alphabet).\n3. Search over a constrained DSL of common transformer motifs (counters, toggles, threshold detectors, small state machines) to synthesize candidate Python programs.\n4. Use SMT-based bounded equivalence checking to either:\n   - Prove that a candidate program and the surrogate agree on all inputs in the domain, or\n   - Produce a counterexample input that rules the program out.<p>If the solver finds a proof, you get a small, human-readable Python function plus a machine-checkable guarantee that it matches the original circuit on that bounded domain.<p>Why I built this<p>Mechanistic interpretability has gotten pretty good at extracting \"small crisp circuits\" from large models, but turning those graphs into clean, human-readable algorithms is still very manual. My goal here is to automate that last step: go from \"here is a sparse circuit\" to \"here is a verified algorithm that explains what it does\", without hand-holding.<p>What works today<p>- Tasks: quote closing and bracket-depth detection from the OpenAI circuit_sparsity repo.\n- Exact surrogate fitting on a finite token domain.\n- DSL templates for simple counters, toggles, and small state machines.\n- SMT-based bounded equivalence between:\n  sparse circuit -> ReLU surrogate -> Python program in the DSL.<p>Limitations and open questions<p>- The guarantees are bounded: equivalence is only proven on a finite token domain (short sequences and a small vocabulary).\n- Currently focused on very small circuits. Scaling to larger circuits and longer contexts is open engineering and research work.\n- The DSL is hand-designed around a few motifs. I am not yet learning the DSL itself or doing anything very clever in the search.<p>What I would love feedback on<p>- Are the problem framing and guarantees interesting to people working on mechanistic interpretability or formal methods?\n- Suggestions for next benchmarks: which circuits or behaviors would you want to see distilled next?\n- Feedback on the DSL design, search strategy, and SMT setup.<p>Happy to answer questions about implementation details, the SMT encoding, integration with OpenAI's Sparse Circuits repo, or anything else.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46518608\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46518608</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Arousal modulates functional connectivity through structured and hemispherically asymmetric community architecture during wakefulness",
    "content": "Arousal fluctuates continuously during wakefulness, yet how these moment-to-moment variations shape large-scale functional connectivity (FC) remains unclear. Here, we combined 7T fMRI with concurrent pupillometry to quantify, for every functional connection, how time-varying FC covaries with spontaneous arousal in the awake human brain. Rather than exerting a uniform influence across the connectome, arousal organized FC into a low-dimensional set of seven connectivity communities, each defined by characteristic network compositions. These communities exhibited systematic but community-specific hemispheric asymmetries, revealing distinct patterns of lateralized arousal modulation. Notably, the ventral attention network showed a pronounced division of labor: left-hemisphere nodes participated flexibly across multiple arousal-sensitive communities, whereas right-hemisphere nodes formed a cohesive, segregated arousal-responsive module. Importantly, hemispheric asymmetry did not arise from global shifts in connectivity strength, but instead reflected structured spatial heterogeneity embedded within community architecture. This modular and asymmetric organization was highly preserved during naturalistic movie watching, indicating that arousal-related modulation of FC reflects intrinsic principles that generalize across awake cognitive contexts. Together, these findings demonstrate that moment-to-moment arousal fluctuations shape large-scale FC through structured, hemispherically asymmetric network organization during wakefulness.",

    "content": "High-density Neuropixels probes enable the study of large neural populations with single-cell and sub-millisecond resolution. While single-probe and acute head-fixed experiments have yielded critical scientific insights, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying many complex behaviors requires simultaneous multi-region recordings in freely moving, chronically implanted animals. Various probe fixtures have been developed to enable high-density recording, but existing designs impose critical limitations: their substantial weight restricts the maximum probe count that smaller animals can support, their bulky dimensions constrain the proximity of targeted brain regions, and their complex assembly risks damaging the probe during insertion and recovery. In this paper, we present a lightweight, fully 3D-printable, compact, and screwless fixture for chronic Neuropixels implants in freely moving rodents that features simple mechanisms for stable implantation and safe extraction. Our fixture design enables stable, high-yield single-unit recordings for months-long experiments, along with an 83% successful probe extraction rate. This fixture design provides a robust and accessible solution for long-term, multi-probe chronic Neuropixels recordings, increasing experimental throughput and enabling more complex experimental designs to investigate brain-wide neural dynamics.",

    "content": "Live sport spectatorship can promote social connection, yet scalable, low-burden strategies to strengthen bonding in real-world spectator settings remain limited. We here tested the hypothesis that co-consuming sparkling water during spectating attenuates hunger and fatigue and strengthens enjoyment and perceived unity, potentially via HR synchrony linked to oxytocin dynamics. In an individually randomized field experiment at a collegiate women basketball home game (sparkling water: n = 21; plain water: n = 19), spectators consumed 200 mL of sparkling water or plain water in synchrony before tip-off and before the end of halftime, with additional ad libitum intake of the assigned beverage permitted thereafter. We assessed acute freshness and hunger, repeated fatigue and enjoyment, interpersonal HR synchrony from the first half to 15-min post-game, perceived unity toward players and fellow spectators, and salivary oxytocin levels. Relative to plain water, sparkling water increased freshness and reduced hunger after intake, attenuated post-game fatigue, and enhanced enjoyment and perceived unity. HR synchrony was preserved in association with attenuated post-game fatigue after the game, and sustained synchrony was associated with higher perceived unity. Oxytocin decreased more in the sparkling-water group, and this decrease was associated with preserved HR synchrony as well as with changes in unity toward fellow fans. These findings support our hypothesis and suggest that co-consuming sparkling water serves as an alcohol-free, low-burden ritual to enhance social connection during and after live sport events.",

    "title": "Long-lasting astrocyte remodeling in Dravet Syndrome Scn1a+/- mouse model.",
    "content": "Background. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a prototypical developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by SCN1A gene mutations leading to NaV1.1 loss of function. The latter causes early-onset drug-resistant seizures and enduring cognitive and behavioral deficits. In this pathological context, the implication of astrocytes remains insufficiently explored. Methods. Using a heterozygous Scn1a knock-out (Scn1a+/-) mouse model that recapitulates the DS-human phenotype, we examine astrocyte remodeling at landmark disease stages, as defined by video-EEG and behavioral read-outs. Results. From initial disease aggravation (PN20-35) to long-term stabilization (up to PN90), Scn1a+/- mice showed increased hippocampal and cortical GFAP transcript and protein levels, compared to age-matched control littermates and to an earlier pre-symptomatic (<PN20) time point. During the aggravation phase in Scn1a+/- mice, astrocyte branching, revealed by GFAP histological analysis and by intracellular delivery of Alexa Fluor 488 in hippocampal slices was increased but not sustained long-term. These disease-stage-dependent astrocyte modifications were not associated with macroscopic hippocampal sclerosis or cortical atrophy. To further study astrocyte remodeling during disease progression, we used biocytin diffusion following single-astrocyte loading to reveal an expanded astrocyte-astrocyte network in Scn1a+/- mice long-term, along with increased Cx30 and Cx43 protein levels. An ethidium bromide uptake assay indicated impaired astrocytic hemichannel function in Scn1a+/- mice long-term. Regionally, these long-term cellular and network astrocyte modifications coincided with augmented post-tetanic synaptic potentiation. Discussion. In DS, astrocytes undergo a long-lasting network remodeling. We discuss how this astrocyte remodeling may be related to seizures as well as synaptic and cognitive deficits.",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

    "title": "Neuro-metabolic pathways of high-protein meal reducing food craving",
    "content": "Across species, high-protein foods have been shown to reduce appetite throughout the day. Although higher protein intake alters multiple metabolic responses, the exact neuro-metabolic mechanisms underlying food craving remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether a protein-rich diet modulates plasma tyrosine dynamics, the precursor of dopamine, thereby altering dopaminergic brain activity and reducing food craving in humans. In this within-subject, cross-over study, 30 healthy participants (age, Mean=23.63, SD=3.23 years) were provided with either a high- or low-protein/carbohydrate breakfast. Three and a half hours after breakfast, participants viewed high-or low caloric food images while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their subjective food craving was assessed using the validated Food Craving Questionnaire- State version. Through the experimental procedure, plasma tyrosine levels were continuously monitored. Our results show that the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast significantly enhanced plasma tyrosine levels, which were negatively associated with subjective food craving several hours after meal intake. Importantly, we observed significantly stronger midbrain activity following the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast, which was associated with greater reduction in subjective food craving. Furthermore, we analyzed brain gradients that characterize spatial patterns of large-scale neural activity, allowing us to examine the entire process underlying dietary choices at the whole-brain level. Compared with the low-protein/carbohydrate breakfast, the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast reduced whole-brain functional reorganization, indicating lower neural sensitivity to high- versus low-caloric food stimuli. Notably, the degree of this high-protein/carbohydrate induced brain-state shift was related to the reduction in food craving. Together, these results provide strong evidence that high-protein/carbohydrate meals modulate dopaminergic mechanisms and large-scale whole-brain neural reorganization, contributing to reduced food craving throughout the day in humans.",

    "title": "Molecular signatures of maladaptive plasticity in the amygdala in a rat model of chronic neuropathic pain",
    "content": "Chronic pain, a complex multidimensional disorder, remains a major health care issue and a therapeutic challenge. Neuropathic pain is a chronic pain condition that results from damage or dysfunction in the nervous system. While mechanisms of neuropathic pain at the peripheral and spinal cord level have been extensively studied, pain mechanisms in the brain remain underexplored. The amygdala, a limbic brain region, has emerged as a critical brain area for the emotional-affective dimension of pain and pain modulation. Amygdala neuroplasticity has been associated with pain states, but exact molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these states and the transition from acute to chronic pain are not well understood. Here, we used the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain in male rats to investigate changes in gene expression in the amygdala at the chronic pain stage using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Two amygdala nuclei, basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA), were investigated in a hemisphere-dependent manner. We used an integrative approach that focuses on functional significance and cell type specificity of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to nominate mechanistic targets for central regulation of chronic pain. Our integrative transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses identified individual genes (e.g., Cxcl10, Cxcl12, Mbp, Plp1, Mag, Mog, Slc17a6, Gad1, Sst), molecular pathways (e.g., cytokine-mediated signaling pathway), biological processes (e.g., myelination, synaptic transmission), and specific cell types (e.g., oligodendrocytes, glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurons) affected by chronic pain. Our results also provide evidence for the emerging concept of hemispheric lateralization of pain processing in the amygdala. Overall, our study proposes oligodendrocyte dysfunction in the amygdala, neuroimmune signaling in CeA, and glutamatergic neurotransmission in BLA as mechanistic determinants of and potential therapeutic targets for the management of chronic neuropathic pain.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN, we're Deniz and Sherry from Tamarind Bio (<a href=\"https://www.tamarind.bio\">https://www.tamarind.bio</a>). Tamarind is an inference provider for AI drug discovery, serving models like AlphaFold. Biopharma companies use our library of leading open-source models to design new medicines computationally.<p>Here\u2019s a demo: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/luoMApPeglo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/luoMApPeglo</a><p>Two years ago, I was hired at a Stanford lab to run models for my labmates. Some post-doc would ask me to run a set of 1-5 models in sequence with tens of thousands inputs and I would email them back the result after setting up the workflow in the university cluster.<p>At some point, it became unreasonable that all of an organization's computational biology work would go through an undergrad, so we built Tamarind as a single place for all molecular AI tools, usable at massive scale with no technical background needed. Today, we are used by much of the top 20 pharma, dozens of biotechs and tens of thousands of scientists.<p>When we started getting adoption in the big pharma companies, we found that this problem also persisted. I know directors of data science, where half their job could be described as running scripts for other people.<p>Lots of companies have also deprecated their internally built solution to switch over, dealing with GPU infra and onboarding docker containers not being a very exciting problem when the company you work for is trying to cure cancer.<p>Unlike non-specialized inference providers, we build both a programmatic interface for developers along with a scientist-friendly web app, since most of our users are non-technical. Some of them used to extract proteins from animal blood before replacing that process with using AI to generate proteins on Tamarind.<p>Besides grinding out images for each of the models we serve, we\u2019ve designed a standardized schema to be able to share each model\u2019s data format. We\u2019ve built a custom scheduler and queue optimized for horizontal scaling (each inference call takes minutes to hours, and runs on one GPU at a time), while splitting jobs across CPUs and GPUs for optimal timing.<p>As we've grown to handle a substantial portion of the biopharma R&amp;D AI demand on behalf of our customers, we've expanded beyond just offering a library of open source protocols.<p>A common use case we saw from early on was the need to connect multiple models together into pipelines, and having reproducible, consistent protocols to replace physical experiments. Once we became the place to build internal tools for computational science, our users started asking if they could onboard their own models to the platform.<p>From there, we now support fine-tuning, building UIs for arbitrary docker containers, connecting to wet lab data sources and more!<p>Reach out to me at deniz[at]tamarind.bio if you\u2019re interested in our work, we are hiring! Check out our product at <a href=\"https://app.tamarind.bio\">https://app.tamarind.bio</a> and let us know if you have any feedback to support how the biotech industry uses AI today.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46515777\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46515777</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

We scanned 88 participants with fMRI during a naturalistic movie-viewing paradigm depicting either industrial cruelty to farm animals (Vicarious Trauma, VT) or positive human-animal interactions (Vicarious Community, VC) with concurrent autonomic physiology and gene expression in circulating monocytes. VT, compared to VC, evoked sustained sympathetic arousal lasting 40 minutes post-viewing and primed innate immune cells to elicit elevated pro-inflammatory (upregulating IL1B and CXCL8) and reduced anti-inflammatory (TGFB1) responses. VT reduced integration in a frontoparietal control system and increased coupling between a salience/action-mode system with paralimbic, basal ganglia, and sensorimotor regions. Disrupted negative coupling between frontoparietal/default-mode and hippocampal systems predicted VT-related CXCL8 increases. These findings shed light on how the brain translates vicarious trauma into the priming of innate immunity.",

    "content": "Adaptation to repetitive sensory inputs promotes efficient neural processing by attenuating responses to redundant information and reallocating resources to novel stimuli. Reduced adaptation has been proposed to contribute to atypical sensory reactivity in autism, but the physiological mechanisms underlying tactile adaptation remain poorly understood. Here, we examined short-term adaptation to repetitive vibrotactile stimulation in autistic and neurotypical adults using high-density electrophysiological recordings. Fifty participants (18-44 years; 25 autistic; 25 neurotypical), received sequences of four brief vibrations to the index fingertip while viewing silent videos. Neural responses were analyzed for an early negative deflection (N1, ~100 milliseconds) indexing basic stimulus recognition, and a later positive deflection (P2, ~200-300 milliseconds) indexing higher-order contextual and attentional processing. Adaptation was quantified as changes in response magnitude across the four vibrations. The N1 did not differ between groups, showing minimal change across repetitions, indicating comparable processing of basic tactile features. In contrast, the P2 was significantly larger overall in the autistic group. Across both groups, responses to the first vibration in each sequence were greater than responses to subsequent vibrations, reflecting re-sensitization following the inter-sequence interval. Autistic participants exhibited consistently amplified P2 responses to initial vibrations, suggesting heightened re-sensitization rather than impaired within-sequence adaptation. Associations between neural responses and clinical measures of autistic traits and tactile sensitivity were modest. These findings indicate that autistic adults show amplified higher-order neural responses to tactile input alongside preserved short-term adaptation. Heightened re-sensitization to repeated touch may reflect shortened refractory periods, contributing to sensory hyper-reactivity and increased perceptual load.",

    "title": "Cortical Thickness and Curvature in Autism and ADHD: A Mega-Analysis",
    "content": "Background: Existing evidence suggests cortical morphometric alterations occur in people with autism and ADHD. However, these findings remain tentative due to small sample sizes, heterogeneous imaging pipelines, varied statistical approaches, and limited harmonization across acquisition sites. Few studies have applied standardized processing to large, clinically enriched datasets or addressed site-related batch effects. Methods: We leveraged six large-scale brain imaging datasets (n = 9,647; male=5,835; female=3,812; ages 5-64 years), including 1,533 individuals with ADHD, 1,080 with autism spectrum disorder, and 7,034 matched controls. All imaging data were processed using the validated ABCD-HCP pipeline, with cortical parcellation into 360 regions based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) atlas, and ComBat harmonization was applied to account for variability across 67 acquisition sites. Group-level differences in cortical thickness and sulcal curvature were examined with ANCOVAs, controlling for covariates and using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results: Our analyses revealed distinct neuroanatomical signatures for both autism and ADHD. Individuals with autism exhibited regionally thinner cortex and curvature alterations particularly in the Cingulo-Opercular network. In contrast, individuals with ADHD displayed regionally thicker cortex, particularly in the default mode and somatomotor networks, alongside curvature differences. Control participants showed intermediate patterns, suggesting that autism and ADHD may represent diverging extremes of cortical maturation. Conclusions: Cortical thickness and curvature emerge as potential biomarkers that can advance understanding of neurodevelopmental conditions and disentangle heterogeneity across diagnostic groups. These findings highlight the value of harmonized, large-scale, standardized analyses for resolving inconsistencies in the literature.",

    "content": "Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of reproductive-age women worldwide and is associated with substantial pain and mental health burden, yet its neurobiological correlates remain poorly characterized. Neuroimaging studies of endometriosis are particularly limited. Here we present a comprehensive, multidimensional investigation of the neurobiology of endometriosis, integrating structural and diffusion neuroimaging, biofluid measures, neuropsychological testing, and detailed health and psychosocial phenotyping in individuals with and without endometriosis. Compared with controls, individuals with endometriosis exhibited higher levels of pain, depression, and anxiety and performed worse across multiple cognitive domains. Global and regional brain morphometric measures did not differ between groups; however, endometriosis-specific pain was associated with altered gray matter volume and white matter microstructure across distributed pain-related neural circuits. These findings identify pain-related neurobiological signatures of endometriosis and establish a foundation for mechanistic and translational studies of its central nervous system effects.",

    "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams.

    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

    "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

It allows you to defer expensive imports until the exact moment they're needed, making your applications faster to start and more memory-efficient.</p> <p>Instead of importing all your heavy dependencies upfront, you register them as import strings and they only get loaded when actually accessed.</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/MilkClouds/lazyregistry\">https://github.com/MilkClouds/lazyregistry</a></p> <p><strong>PyPI:</strong> <code>pip install lazyregistry</code></p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li>CLI tools where startup time matters</li> <li>Libraries with optional dependencies (e.g., don't import torch if the user doesn't use it)</li> <li>ML projects with heavy dependencies (torch, tensorflow, transformers, etc.)</li> <li>Anyone who wants to build their own <code>AutoModel.from_pretrained()</code> system like transformers</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Implementing lazy loading yourself:</p> <pre><code>import importlib class LazyRegistry: def __init__(self): self._registry = {} self._cache = {} def register(self, key, import_path): self._registry[key] = import_path def __getitem__(self, key): if key in self._cache: return self._cache[key] import_path = self._registry[key] module_path, attr_name = import_path.split(&quot;:&quot;) module = importlib.import_module(module_path) obj = getattr(module, attr_name) self._cache[key] = obj return obj # Still missing: __setitem__, update(), keys(), values(), items(), # __contains__, __iter__, __len__, error handling, type hints, ... </code></pre> <p>Or just <code>pip install lazyregistry</code> \u2014 <strong>lightweight, only 1 dependency (pydantic)</strong>:</p> <pre><code>from lazyregistry import Registry registry = Registry(name=&quot;components&quot;) registry[&quot;a&quot;] = &quot;heavy_module_1:ClassA&quot; registry[&quot;b&quot;] = &quot;heavy_module_2:ClassB&quot; component = registry[&quot;a&quot;] # Imported here </code></pre> <h1>Basic Usage:</h1> <pre><code>from lazyregistry import Registry registry = Registry(name=&quot;plugins&quot;) # Register by import string (lazy - imported on access) registry[&quot;json&quot;] = &quot;json:dumps&quot; # Register by instance (immediate - already imported) import pickle registry[&quot;pickle&quot;] = pickle.dumps # Import happens HERE, not before serializer = registry[&quot;json&quot;] </code></pre> <h1>Build Your Own Auto Registry</h1> <p>Ever wanted to build your own <code>AutoModel.from_pretrained()</code> system like transformers? lazyregistry provides the building blocks:</p> <pre><code>from lazyregistry import Registry from lazyregistry.pretrained import AutoRegistry, PretrainedConfig, PretrainedMixin class BertConfig(PretrainedConfig): model_type: str = &quot;bert&quot; hidden_size: int = 768 class AutoModel(AutoRegistry): registry = Registry(name=&quot;models&quot;) config_class = PretrainedConfig type_key = &quot;model_type&quot; @AutoModel.register_module(&quot;bert&quot;) class BertModel(PretrainedMixin): config_class = BertConfig # Register third-party models lazily AutoModel.registry[&quot;gpt2&quot;] = &quot;transformers:GPT2Model&quot; # Save config to ./model/config.json config = BertConfig(hidden_size=1024) model = BertModel(config=config) model.save_pretrained(&quot;./model&quot;) # Load any registered model - auto-detects type from config.json loaded = AutoModel.from_pretrained(&quot;./model&quot;) </code></pre> <p>You get model registration, config-based type detection, and lazy loading of heavy dependencies.</p> <h1>Tip: Combining with lazy-loader</h1> <p>For packages with many heavy dependencies, you can combine <code>lazyregistry</code> with <a href=\"https://github.com/scientific-python/lazy-loader\">lazy-loader</a>:</p> <pre><code># mypackage/__init__.py from typing import TYPE_CHECKING if TYPE_CHECKING: # IDE autocomplete, mypy, pyright from .bert import BertModel as BertModel from .gpt2 import GPT2Model as GPT2Model else: # Runtime: nothing imported until accessed import lazy_loader as lazy __getattr__, __dir__, __all__ = lazy.attach(__name__, submod_attrs={...}) # mypackage/auto.py from lazyregistry import Registry AutoModel.registry.update({ &quot;bert&quot;: &quot;mypackage.bert:BertModel&quot;, # Deferred until registry access &quot;gpt2&quot;: &quot;mypackage.gpt2:GPT2Model&quot;, }) </code></pre> <p>Double lazy loading: <code>lazy-loader</code> defers module imports, <code>lazyregistry</code> defers registry lookups.</p> <p>I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spirited_Prize_6058\"> /u/Spirited_Prize_6058 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4qnii/lazyregistry_a_lightweight_python_library_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4qnii/lazyregistry_a_lightweight_python_library_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Modulating speech tracking through brain state-dependent changes in audio loudness",
    "content": "Objective. To determine whether the perceptual intensity of speech signals\u2014manipulated via loudness and dynamically adjusted through a brain state-dependent stimulation (BSDS) paradigm\u2014modulates neural speech tracking and short-term memory. Approach. We implemented an EEG brain state-dependent design in which real-time variations in alpha power were used to modulate the loudness of pre-recorded digits during a task modelled on the digit span test. Speech tracking was quantified using lagged Gaussian copula mutual information (2\u201310 Hz), and behavioural performance was assessed through recall accuracy. Main results. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher loudness would enhance speech tracking and memory via bottom\u2013up attention, digit recall accuracy was stable across loudness conditions. Speech tracking revealed an unexpected pattern: louder stimuli presented during high alpha power (low attention) elicited reduced tracking magnitudes and shorter peak latencies, whereas quieter stimuli delivered during low alpha power (high attention) produced stronger and more temporally extended tracking responses. Significance. These findings may suggest that internal attentional state, rather than external stimulus salience, plays a dominant role in shaping speech encoding. The study provides proof-of-concept evidence for BSDS in auditory paradigms, showing the importance of attentional fluctuations and stimulus loudness in determining the strength and timing of neural speech tracking, with implications for the design of adaptive speech-enhancement strategies.",

    "title": "Characterization of vagus nerve active fibers during seizure in rats",
    "content": "Objective. Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million individuals worldwide. Vagus nerve activity is known to be modulated by seizures; however, the types of fibers that are activated during seizures remain unknown. This work compares the electrical activity of the vagus nerve before, during, and after seizures in epileptic rats. Approach. Six rats experiencing pentylenetetrazol-induced epilepsy seizures and two rats under saline solution were investigated. Action potentials (AP) identified by template matching were sorted according to the fiber type they are deemed to originate from. AP templates were based on a 3D COMSOL simplified model of the vagus nerve. Model templates were established for fibers of different diameters based on histology. Correspondences are thus established based on specific fiber diameters. Main results. During seizures, an increase in the percentage of occurrence of APs was observed for 2 \u03bcm and 3 \u03bcm fibers, while a decrease was observed for 4 \u00b5m, 5\u20136 \u00b5m, and 7\u201311 \u00b5m fibers. This was not observed in the rat group under saline solution. The increase in smaller diameter sizes is believed to be linked to an increase in autonomic activity. Significance. These findings contribute to a better understanding of vagus nerve dynamics during epileptic seizures and highlight the potential of vagus nerve activity as a physiological marker for seizure detection and monitoring. This would be of particular interest in vagus nerve stimulation to control any closed-loop form of therapy. This work provides a foundation for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in epilepsy management.",

    "title": "Multitimescale Computation by Astrocytes",
    "content": "The basic computational unit of the brain has long been defined as the neuron. However, mounting evidence suggests that other cells, especially astrocytes, also perform computation. Here we demonstrate that cerebellar astrocytes decompose norepinephrine input into slow and fast calcium activities through differential adrenergic receptor engagement. During reward learning in mice, slow and fast activities selectively target distinct synaptic pathways. Causal manipulations reveal that slow 1-adrenergic signals maintain behavioral states and coordinate transitions, while fast 2-adrenergic signals govern event-triggered responses and reinforcement learning. Remarkably, an actor-critic neural network trained on a similar sequence task spontaneously recapitulates these multitimescale dynamics, suggesting astrocytes implement critic-like computations that evaluate states and modulate neuronal learning. These findings establish astrocytes as multilevel processors that transform univariate neuromodulatory inputs into multivariate, pathway-specific circuit control operating in parallel with neuronal processing.",

    "title": "INS-fMRI reveals a mesoscale limbic organization associated with medial pulvinar in primates",
    "content": "The experience of emotion comprises not only the feelings (happiness, sadness), but also behavioral expression, internal awareness, and the body's physiological response. However, it remains unclear how the brain integrates these disparate aspects of emotion. Here, to examine functional connectivity in the limbic system of macaque monkeys, we combined focal Infrared Neural Stimulation of a sensory gateway (medial pulvinar PM), with ultra-high-field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (INS-fMRI). We find connected sites are mesoscale (millimeter-scale) in size and arranged in patchy patterns across cingulate, insula, and amygdala. Non-overlapping connections evoked from three sequential stimulation sites in PM form clusters of multi-site integration, and appear related to known functional organization within these limbic regions. We suggest these mesoscale functional connections link the limbic axes of motor expression (cingulate), interoception (insula), and emotion-related processing (amygdala), and that, much like visual system, the limbic system is fundamentally quite orderly at mesoscale. Our results underscore the importance of millimeter-scale precision and organization in diagnosis and treatment of affective disorders.",

    "title": "Non-Canonical ERP Patterns in Second-language Sentence Processing: Evidence from Syntactic, Semantic, and Phonological Violations in Japanese Learners of English",
    "content": "Background/Objectives: Despite notable advances in the neural mechanisms of second-language (L2) processing, few studies have systematically compared syntactic, semantic, and phonological processing of L2 within a single experimental design. We investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying L2 sentence processing in native Japanese speakers with intermediate English proficiency. By integrating behavioral measures and event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined how syntactic, semantic, and phonological information influenced sentence comprehension. Methods: Twenty-seven participants completed an auditory sentence judgment task involving English sentences with a syntactic, semantic, or phonological error. Results: Behavioral results revealed the highest accuracy in the control and semantic conditions, while syntactic and phonological violations led to significantly lower performance, indicating greater processing difficulty in these domains. Among the three linguistic violation types, phonological violations elicited the robust ERP negativities across both time 300-500 ms and 500-800 ms time windows, while syntactic and semantic violations evoked less consistent neural responses in this L2 auditory sentence judgment task. These results suggest that mismatches in expected phonological forms hinder lexical activation, triggering a negativity that resembles an N400 but reflects different underlying processes. Conclusion: We found non-canonical neural response patterns in L2 learners, characterized by sensitivity to phonological anomalies but minimal neural disruption for semantic or syntactic anomalies. The current study contributes to our understanding of L2 sentence processing in native Japanese speakers, particularly by aligning real-time neural responses with behavioral performance. This work offers implications for pedagogical practices and assessment strategies tailored to neurodiverse bilingual populations.",

    "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "title": "Intrinsic and extrinsic feedback generate similar propulsion but distinct biomechanical strategies during split-belt walking",
    "content": "BackgroundForward propulsion during walking is generated by different joints and biomechanical mechanisms depending on environmental and task demands. Although propulsion can be modulated by feedback, it is unclear whether extrinsic and intrinsic feedback generate similar propulsion or promote different joint-level strategies during split-belt walking. The purpose of this study was to investigate strategies used by non-impaired individuals to generate greater propulsion using different feedback to reach targeted levels of propulsion force during split-belt walking.MethodsFifteen young adults walked on a split-belt treadmill with the dominant leg on the fast belt at their comfortable walking speed and the non-dominant leg on the slow belt at half speed. They performed trials with extrinsic via visual feedback of propulsive force (targeting 5 and 10% body weight) and with intrinsic feedback via a backward resistive force at the center of mass (5 and 10% body weight). Primary outcome was propulsion accuracy, measured as average propulsion error relative to target levels. Secondary analyses examined explanatory biomechanical variables related to propulsion generation. Outcomes were analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.ResultsParticipants achieved similar target propulsion across feedback types (p =\u202f0.66). However, biomechanical strategies differed. Visual feedback increased trailing limb angle (TLA) at 5% (p =\u202f0.0011) and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001) and increased ankle moment at 5% (p =\u202f0.0005) and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001). In contrast, backward resistive force increased (BRF) hip moment at 5% (p =\u202f0.0018) and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001), and hip power at both 5 and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001). Ankle power did not differ between feedback types at 5% (p =\u202f0.0754) but was greater under BRF at 10% (p <\u202f0.0001).ConclusionWhile both feedback types generate similar propulsion to achieve different target levels during split-belt treadmill walking, they engaged distinct biomechanical strategies. Our results indicate that participants increased TLA and ankle moment under visual feedback. However, they increased hip moment and hip power under BRF, with ankle power adjustments depending on the target level. The findings highlight motor abundance in gait and suggest tailoring rehabilitation strategies in populations with impaired propulsion.",

    "title": "The neurobiology of play: a narrative review of evidence from mice and humans for advancing neurorehabilitation",
    "content": "ObjectiveThis narrative conceptual review explores the neurobiological underpinnings of play behaviour across species, with an emphasis on how play affects brain development, social functioning, and cognitive outcomes from early life through aging.MethodsWe synthesize current neuroscientific literature from animal and human studies, focusing on translational evidence involving specific brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, amygdala, striatum), neurochemical systems (e.g., dopamine, opioids), and behavioral domains (e.g., executive function, emotional regulation, and social cognition). Studies are categorized by developmental stage and functional impact.ResultsEvidence from rodent models demonstrates the activation of distinct neural circuits during structured and spontaneous play (e.g., hide-and-seek, rough-and-tumble), with sex-specific differences in cortical and subcortical engagement. In humans, play emerges in infancy and supports neural plasticity, language development, and executive functioning. Later in life, playfulness correlates with cognitive resilience and may act as a protective factor against neurodegeneration. The review also highlights play-based rehabilitation approaches (e.g., sensory-motor therapy, LEGO\u00ae-based interventions, sports) with demonstrated neurological and psychosocial benefits.ConclusionPlay is a multidimensional, evolutionarily conserved behaviour that engages neurobiological systems critical to development and health. Although promising evidence supports play-based interventions, further research is needed to clarify mechanisms, optimize therapeutic use, and bridge species-specific findings in translational neuroscience.",

    "title": "Robustness, spatial detail, and pitfalls of fixed ICA dimensionality in resting-state fMRI networks at 1.5, 3, and 7\u202fT",
    "content": "Resting-state fMRI functional connectivity analysis is usually performed with seed-based methods that strongly rely on user-dependent definitions of regions of interest. Data-driven methods like independent component analysis (ICA) can mitigate this need. However, the number of components that should be expected in an fMRI acquisition, which determines the model order of the ICA, is not defined, and it is not uniformly chosen across studies. This variability is further complicated by the dependence of component number on field strength, with higher field strengths typically yielding more detectable components. Therefore, relying on a predetermined number may influence the results. Here, we compare functional maps obtained through ICA analysis at different magnetic field strengths and at various levels of spatial detail. Our results confirm the presence of the most frequently reported resting-state networks across field strengths and demonstrate that higher magnetic field strength enables more robust detection of functional networks with greater spatial detail. We also show that: (1) fixing the number of components, although improving interpretability of group results, may provide an incomplete picture of brain function; (2) a greater number of components is consistently identified at higher field strength, suggesting that the model order should be adapted according to both field strength and spatial detail.",

    "content": "TANK-binding kinase (TBK1) copy number variations have been identified as a monogenic cause of familial normal tension glaucoma (NTG). While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a common risk factor in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), NTG develops in the absence of IOP elevation. The current available standard of care for glaucoma is lowering IOP, highlighting the need to explore alternative therapeutic mechanisms. The established roles of TBK1 in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) signaling, as well as its involvement in autophagy, suggest it may contribute to glaucomatous neurodegeneration by exacerbating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) stress and optic nerve (ON) damage. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge on the contribution of TBK1 to glaucomatous pathology, focusing on its genetic and molecular roles. By identifying gaps in understanding, this work seeks to guide future research efforts into the mechanisms underlying TBK1\u2019s influence on NTG and to explore therapeutic strategies targeting its pathways.",

    "content": "BackgroundStroke patients often experience significant impairments, making rapid and accurate detection crucial for timely intervention and early warning. However, existing diagnostic methods such as advanced neuroimaging are often time-consuming, highly dependent on operator expertise, or costly and complex to deploy, limiting their scalability in resource-restricted settings. Eye movement patterns in stroke patients present a promising opportunity for efficient detection, given their close ties to underlying neurocognitive mechanisms and potential diagnostic sensitivity. Nevertheless, the lack of a feasible task paradigm and robust detection strategy has hindered the practical application of eye movement-based stroke identification. This study aimed to capture eye movement dysfunction associated with stroke through an ecological paradigm and develop a machine learning model with improved diagnostic accuracy.MethodsWe recorded eye movement signals in stroke patients (N = 16) and healthy controls (N = 23) during free visual exploration of familiar dramatic character faces. A diverse set of eye movement features, encompassing saccadic, fixation, and scanpath features, was extracted and analyzed. These features were subsequently employed to construct machine learning models for the recognition of stroke patients.ResultsWe identified distinctive eye movement patterns in the stroke group, including prolonged fixation duration, restricted saccadic movements, and reduced scanpath length, which reflect underlying visual processing impairments. Furthermore, by integrating these multi-dimensional eye movement features, our machine learning model achieved a high accuracy of 87.18% and an excellent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.92 in distinguishing stroke patients.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that ecologically valid eye-tracking, combined with multi-type feature analytics, serves as a practical screening tool with the potential to significantly improve identification accuracy and alleviate logistical burdens in community and primary care settings.",

    "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "title": "Realistic adversarial scenario generation via human-like pedestrian model for autonomous vehicle control parameter optimisation",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.02082v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly advancing and are expected to play a central role in future mobility. Ensuring their safe deployment requires reliable interaction with other road users, not least pedestrians. Direct testing on public roads is costly and unsafe for rare but critical interactions, making simulation a practical alternative. Within simulation-based testing, adversarial scenarios are widely used to probe safety limits, but many prioritise difficulty over realism, producing exaggerated behaviours which may result in AV controllers that are overly conservative. We propose an alternative method, instead using a cognitively inspired pedestrian model featuring both inter-individual and intra-individual variability to generate behaviourally plausible adversarial scenarios. We provide a proof of concept demonstration of this method's potential for AV control optimisation, in closed-loop testing and tuning of an AV controller. Our results show that replacing the rule-based CARLA pedestrian with the human-like model yields more realistic gap acceptance patterns and smoother vehicle decelerations. Unsafe interactions occur only for certain pedestrian individuals and conditions, underscoring the importance of human variability in AV testing. Adversarial scenarios generated by this model can be used to optimise AV control towards safer and more efficient behaviour. Overall, this work illustrates how incorporating human-like road user models into simulation-based adversarial testing can enhance the credibility of AV evaluation and provide a practical basis to behaviourally informed controller optimisation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.02047v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Selective exposure to online news occurs when users favor information that confirms their beliefs, creating filter bubbles and limiting diverse perspectives. Interactive systems can counter this by recommending different perspectives, but to achieve this, they need a real-time metric for selective exposure. We present an experiment where we evaluate Electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking as indicators for selective exposure by using eye tracking to recognize which textual parts participants read and using EEG to quantify the magnitude of selective exposure. Participants read online news while we collected EEG and eye movements with their agreement towards the news. We show that the agreement with news correlates positively with the theta band power in the parietal area. Our results indicate that future interactive systems can sense selective exposure using EEG and eye tracking to propose a more balanced information diet. This work presents an integrated experimental setup that identifies selective exposure using gaze and EEG-based metrics.",

The system incorporates an 8-channel EEG front end, supports 5-second stimulus durations, and executes the entire SSVEP decoding pipeline locally, eliminating dependence on PC-based processing. EdgeSSVEP was evaluated using six stimulus frequencies (7, 8, 9, 11, 7.5, and 8.5 Hz) with 10 participants. The device achieved 99.17% classification accuracy and 27.33 bits/min Information Transfer Rate (ITR), while consuming substantially less power than conventional desktop-based systems. The system integrates motion sensing to support artifact detection and improve robustness and signal stability in practical environments. For development and debugging, the system also provides optional TCP data streaming to external clients.

These limitations significantly affect the accuracy, stability, and long-term usability of BCIs. This article introduces the concept of the Neural Digital Twin (NDT) as an advanced solution to overcome these barriers. NDT represents a dynamic, personalized computational model of the brain-BCI system that is continuously updated with real-time neural data, enabling prediction of brain states, optimization of control commands, and adaptive tuning of decoding algorithms. The design of NDT draws inspiration from the application of Digital Twin technology in advanced industries such as aerospace and autonomous vehicles, and leverages recent advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience data acquisition technologies.

In response, the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) approach has emerged as both a design philosophy and a methodological complement to prevailing technology-centered AI paradigms. Placing humans at the core, HCAI seeks to ensure that AI systems serve, augment, and empower humans rather than harm or replace them. This chapter establishes the conceptual and methodological foundations of HCAI by tracing its evolution and recent advancements. It introduces key HCAI concepts, frameworks, guiding principles, methodologies, and practical strategies that bridge philosophical HCAI principles with operational implementation. Through an analytical review of the emerging characteristics and challenges of AI technologies, the chapter positions HCAI as a holistic paradigm for aligning AI innovation with human values, societal well-being, and sustainable progress. Finally, this chapter outlines the structure and contributions of the Handbook of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.

    "content": "arXiv:2601.01227v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Language learning is a multifaceted process. Insufficient vocabulary can hinder communication and lead to demotivation. For non-Chinese speaking (NCS) students, learning Traditional Chinese (Cantonese) poses distinct challenges, particularly due to the complexity of converting spoken and written forms. To address this issue, this study examines the effectiveness of real-life scenario simulations integrated with interactive social robots in enhancing NCS student engagement and language acquisition. The research employs a quasi-experimental design involving NCS students who interact with an AI-driven, robot-assisted language learning system, LiveBo. The study aims to assess the impact of this innovative approach on active participation and motivation. Data are collected through proficiency tests, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Findings indicate that NCS students experience positive improvements in behavioural and emotional engagement, motivation and learning outcomes, highlighting the potential of integrating novel technologies in language education. We plan to compare with the control group in the future. This study highlights the significance of interactive and immersive learning experiences in promoting motivation and enhancing language acquisition among NCS students.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.01218v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Creativity is increasingly recognized as an important skill in education, and storytelling can enhance motivation and engagement among students. However, conventional storytelling methods often lack the interactive elements necessary to engage students. To this end, this study examines the impact of an interactive digital storytelling system incorporating a human-like robot on student engagement and creativity. The study aims to compare engagement levels across three modalities: paper-based, PowerPoint, and robot-assisted storytelling, MotiBo. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, this work involves three groups of students who interact with the storytelling system over a five-day learning. Findings reveal that students using MotiBo exhibit statistically significant improvement in behavioural and cognitive engagement compared to those using traditional methods. These results suggest that the integration of novel technologies can effectively enhance the learning experience, ultimately promoting creativity and self-learning ability in educational settings. Future research will investigate the long-term effects of these technologies on learning outcomes and explore their potential for broader applications in diverse educational contexts.",

However, existing LLM-based search systems primarily rely on semantic features, creating a misalignment with the socialized cognition underlying natural information seeking. To address this gap, we explore how the integration of social cues into LLM-based search influences users' perceptions, experiences, and behaviors. Focusing on social media platforms that are beginning to adopt LLM-based search, we integrate design workshops, the implementation of the prototype system (SoulSeek), a between-subjects study, and mixed-method analyses to examine both outcome- and process-level findings. The workshop informs the prototype's cue-integrated design. The study shows that social cues improve perceived outcomes and experiences, promote reflective information behaviors, and reveal limits of current LLM-based search. We propose design implications emphasizing better social-knowledge understanding, personalized cue settings, and controllable interactions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.01027v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: From movie characters to modern science fiction - bringing characters into interactive, story-driven conversations has captured imaginations across generations. Achieving this vision is highly challenging and requires much more than just language modeling. It involves numerous complex AI challenges, such as conversational AI, maintaining character integrity, managing personality and emotions, handling knowledge and memory, synthesizing voice, generating animations, enabling real-world interactions, and integration with physical environments. Recent advancements in the development of foundation models, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks have enabled researchers to address these individual challenges. However, combining these technologies for interactive characters remains an open problem. We present a system and platform for conveniently designing believable digital characters, enabling a conversational and story-driven experience while providing solutions to all of the technical challenges. As a proof-of-concept, we introduce Digital Einstein, which allows users to engage in conversations with a digital representation of Albert Einstein about his life, research, and persona. While Digital Einstein exemplifies our methods for a specific character, our system is flexible and generalizes to any story-driven or conversational character. By unifying these diverse AI components into a single, easy-to-adapt platform, our work paves the way for immersive character experiences, turning the dream of lifelike, story-based interactions into a reality.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.20692v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.",

Classical paradoxes in decision making suggest that human perception distorts probability magnitudes. Previous accounts postulate a Probability Weighting Function that transforms perceived probabilities; however, its motivation has been debated. Recent work has sought to motivate this function in terms of noisy representations of probabilities in the human mind. Here, we present an account of the Probability Weighting Function grounded in rational inference over optimal decoding from noisy neural encoding of quantities. We show that our model accurately accounts for behavior in a lottery task and a dot counting task. It further accounts for adaptation to a bimodal short-term prior. Taken together, our results provide a unifying account grounding the human representation of probability in rational inference.",

    "content": "arXiv:2508.21445v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Synaptic plasticity typically produces heavy-tailed distributions of synaptic strengths, consisting of a few strong connections among many weaker ones. Meanwhile, structural plasticity relies on distinct signaling cascades to reshape network topology. We propose a model in which both types of plasticity adhere to the Hebbian principle while operating within homeostatically regulated activity. Synaptic plasticity alone generates heavy-tailed weight distributions, but only when any activity spreading beyond neighboring units is discarded. However, when combined with Hebbian structural plasticity, i.e., adaptive rewiring, heavy-tailed weight distributions also arise with more extensive activity flow. Furthermore, adaptive rewiring provides complex network structures with convergent-divergent circuits similar to those that facilitate signal transmission throughout the nervous system. Having adaptive weight adjustment and rewiring driven by the same homeostatic dynamics gives our model a parsimonious and robust framework that simultaneously produces heavy-tailed weight distributions and convergent-divergent units under a wide range of dynamical regimes. Consequently, the model accounts for key connectivity structures in both C. elegans and the mouse, suggesting that its principles are shared across species of different complexities.",

Widely available ECG through wearable devices proposes a pragmatic alternative. This research investigates whether ECG signals can reliably reflect cognitive load and serve as proxies for EEG-based indicators. In this work, we present multimodal data acquired from two different paradigms involving working-memory and passive-listening tasks. For each modality, we extracted ECG time-domain HRV metrics and Catch22 descriptors against EEG spectral and Catch22 features, respectively. We propose a cross-modal XGBoost framework to project the ECG features onto EEG-representative cognitive spaces, thereby allowing workload inferences using only ECG. Our results show that ECG-derived projections expressively capture variation in cognitive states and provide good support for accurate classification. Our findings underpin ECG as an interpretable, real-time, wearable solution for everyday cognitive monitoring.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.02143v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the development of tobacco addiction due to ongoing brain maturation and susceptibility to social influences, such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Craving -the strong desire to use drugs -already emerges with non-daily tobacco use and predicts continued use and relapse. However, the roles of craving and ETS exposure during the early stages of tobacco use in adolescence remain poorly understood. In this pre-registered study, we harness a recently developed fMRI marker of craving -the Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS) -to compare craving-related brain responses to smoking versus social cues in adolescent Experimental Smokers (N=100) and Non-smokers (N=48) with varying levels of ETS exposure levels. Results showed that NCS responses to smoking cues compared to alternative social rewards were higher in Experimental Smokers compared to Non-smokers and predicted individual differences in self-reported craving and monthly smoking. Both smoking behavior and NCS responses were correlated with the relative amount of ETS exposure from peers compared to exposure from family members. Together, these findings indicate a heightened sensitivity of craving-related brain circuits already during experimental smoking and highlight the important role of peer social norms on craving and smoking initiation in the critical period of adolescence.",

We point to simple biological details -- e.g. nonnegative firing and energetic/space budgets in connectionist architectures -- which, when mixed with the requirements of solving a task, produce models that predict brain responses down to single-neuron tuning. We understand this as details constraining the set of plausible algorithms, and their implementations, such that only `brain-like' algorithms are learned. In particular, each biological detail breaks a symmetry in connectionist models (scale, rotation, permutation) leading to interpretable single-neuron responses that are meaningfully characteristic of particular algorithms. This view helps us not only understand the brain's choice of algorithm but also infer algorithm from measured neural responses. Further, this perspective aligns computational neuroscience with mechanistic interpretability in AI, suggesting a more unified approach to studying the mechanisms of intelligence, both natural and artificial.",

However, the computational mechanism underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here, we present a dual-module neural network framework, the CATS Net, to bridge this gap. Our model consists of a concept-abstraction module that extracts low-dimensional conceptual representations, and a task-solving module that performs visual judgement tasks under the hierarchical gating control of the formed concepts. The system develops transferable semantic structure based on concept representations that enable cross-network knowledge transfer through conceptual communication. Model-brain fitting analyses reveal that these emergent concept spaces align with both neurocognitive semantic model and brain response structures in the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex, while the gating mechanisms mirror that in the semantic control brain network. This work establishes a unified computational framework that can offer mechanistic insights for understanding human conceptual cognition and engineering artificial systems with human-like conceptual intelligence.",

We recorded stereoelectroencephalography data from the insula while human subjects with implanted electrode contacts performed a facial emotion recognition task involving disgusted, fearful, angry, sad, neutral, and happy expressions. Expression category specificity of insular activity was assessed via pairwise comparisons of within- and between-category pattern similarities, capturing both the shape and scale of event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs; theta to high-gamma frequency ranges). Insular activity successfully identified all investigated expressions, mediated by diverse ERP responses intermixed across the insula. In contrast to the marked heterogeneity of insula ERP responses, the fusiform face area exhibited convergent ERP responses across expressions and contacts, with ERSPs also contributing substantially to expression identification. These findings not only elucidate the insula's neural mechanisms underlying facial emotion perception, but also establish a potential single-contact-level neural substrate for how the insula leverages its heterogeneous response profiles to act as a key hub for versatile cognitive and emotional functions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.00984v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Krotov and Hopfield (2021) proposed a biologically plausible two-layer associative memory network with memory storage capacity exponential in the number of visible neurons. However, the capacity was only linear in the number of hidden neurons. This limitation arose from the choice of nonlinearity between the visible and hidden units, which enforced winner-takes-all dynamics in the hidden layer, thereby restricting each hidden unit to encode only a single memory. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel associative memory network with a threshold nonlinearity that enables distributed representations. In contrast to winner-takes-all dynamics, where each hidden neuron is tied to an entire memory, our network allows hidden neurons to encode basic components shared across many memories. Consequently, complex patterns are represented through combinations of hidden neurons. These representations reduce redundancy and allow many correlated memories to be stored compositionally. Thus, we achieve much higher capacity: exponential in the number of hidden units, provided the number of visible units is sufficiently larger than the number of hidden neurons. Exponential capacity arises because all binary states of the hidden units can become stable memory patterns with an appropriately chosen threshold. Moreover, the distributed hidden representation, which has much lower dimensionality than the visible layer, preserves class-discriminative structure, supporting efficient nonlinear decoding. These results establish a new regime for associative memory, enabling high-capacity, robust, and scalable architectures consistent with biological constraints.",

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "title": "Shaped by meaning, weighted by reliability: New insights into multisensory integration",
    "content": "In everyday perception, sensory information is rarely interpreted in isolation. Instead, observers generate expectations about what is likely to occur next, using contextual information to guide decisions, particularly when sensory input is weak, ambiguous, or uncertain. These expectations can facilitate behaviour when they align with incoming evidence, but impose costs when they conflict, shaping how information from different senses contributes to behaviour. However, it remains unclear what kind of multisensory process is engaged when meaning guides decisions, and whether multisensory facilitation and non-independence reflect a single integrative mechanism or distinct routes shaped by context. Here, we examined how semantic context, visual clarity, and the relationship between auditory and visual signals jointly shape behaviour in a semantic correspondence task using dynamic, naturalistic events. Participants judged whether a target matched a preceding concept prime, establishing an expectation at the level of meaning. Targets were auditory-only, visual-only (clear or blurry), or audiovisual (AV), with AV components conveying either the same or different meanings across modalities. AV facilitation was not a general consequence of stimulus redundancy. When the prime accurately predicted the target and auditory and visual signals conveyed the same meaning, degrading visual input increased the contribution of auditory information, leading to faster responses and violations of the race-model inequality. By contrast, when the prime indicated the target but auditory and visual signals conveyed competing meanings, AV stimulation produced robust behavioural costs relative to vision. When the prime did not match the target, congruent and incongruent audiovisual events produced comparable effects, and race-model violations were observed even when auditory and visual signals encoded different concepts, indicating convergence at the level of the response rather than shared perceptual content. Finally, exploratory clustering revealed two participant subgroups with comparable overall response speed but systematically different multisensory profiles when semantic expectations did not allow reliable anticipation of the upcoming event. Together, these findings show that multisensory effects in semantic decisions are shaped by meaning and arise through two functionally distinct routes: one in which reduced sensory reliability promotes joint use of congruent audiovisual information, and another in which perceptually different signals converge on the same response when semantic expectations are not met.",

    "title": "Zebrin molecular identity and cerebellar location determine Purkinje cell vulnerability in Christianson syndrome mice",
    "content": "Ataxia is a major characteristic feature in Christianson syndrome, where Purkinje cells in the anterior cerebellar vermis are vulnerable to degeneration while those in the posterior vermis are resilient. Here, we provide a temporal study of changes in Purkinje cell function, cell vulnerability and innervation of cerebellar nuclei in a mouse model of Christianson syndrome. Purkinje cells express certain molecules in a patterned manner across the cerebellum, such as aldolase C/zebrin-II (zebrin). We show that zebrin patterning appears normal before disease onset in Christianson syndrome mice with no apparent cell death, similar to what has been reported in patients. We observe rapid Purkinje cell death in the anterior lobe of Christianson syndrome mice that is exclusive to zebrin-negative Purkinje cells, with zebrin-positive Purkinje cells showing resilience. Intrinsic firing deficits exclusively in the anterior cerebellum are observed at the same time as the first observed cell death in the anterior cerebellum. In contrast, posterior Purkinje cells degenerated later, but zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive cells were equally susceptible to degeneration. Purkinje cells' innervation in the cerebellar nuclei was also lost in Christianson syndrome mice in a region-specific manner: neurons in the anterior cerebellar nuclei, with predominantly zebrin-negative Purkinje cells' inputs, displayed dramatic loss of Purkinje cells' innervation, while neurons in the posterior cerebellar nuclei, innervated by both zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive terminals, showed greater resiliency. Together, our results highlight that cerebellar location and zebrin molecular identity appear important to the vulnerability of Purkinje cells and their innervation in the cerebellar nuclei in Christianson syndrome.",

    "title": "HONeD-in on Brain Activity: Deconvolving Passive Diffusion on the Structural Network from Functional Brain Signals",
    "content": "Brain regions perform distinct computations, and their signals propagate through the whole-brain white matter network. Yet, mathematical models that describe this signal propagation via purely passive diffusion can predict a considerable amount of the observed functional connectivity between regions. This raises a critical question: if so much functional connectivity can be explained by a passive process, how can we isolate the active process? Here, we calculate in closed-form an estimate for such an active signal in functional MRI by spatially deconvolving the effect of passive signal spread over the brain's structural connectivity using a higher-order network diffusion (HONeD) model. Across 770 Human Connectome Project subjects, we show that the resulting HONeD-innovation (HONeD-in) signal 1) sparsifies functional connectivity while retaining a well-connected network, 2) remodels resting-state networks (RSNs), 3) mixes the unimodal--multimodal hierarchical organization of RSNs into a circle with no clear hierarchy, and 4) deblurs task-activation maps. Together, our results highlight HONeD deconvolution as a generalizable new way to study resting-state and task fMRI brain signals.",

    "title": "PyPDFForm v4.1.1 has released",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Happy new year <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>! It's been a bit over half a year since the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ljas6t/pypdfform_v300_has_released/\">last post</a> I made about PyPDFForm. As the project starts its sixth year of development, I'd like to update you with a handful (yet not a complete list) of new features that have been introduced in the last 7 months, some of which were requested by the exact fellow redditors of you guys:</p> <ol> <li>Performance! Yes I know people mock Python for its performance, but that doesn't stop us from writing faster code. A number of PyPDFForm's old, not performant APIs, for example create form fields, are deprecated/removed and replaced by their more performant equivalencies. Now it should be faster to do things with PyPDFForm, especially in bulk.</li> <li>Thanks to qpdf, the project now has even better appearance handling ability, making it capable of generating at least ASCII based text appearances for single line text fields. This is rather significant because not all PDF viewers have bulitin appearance generation functionality. In the case when one doesn't, PyPDFForm now offers a fallback.</li> <li>You can draw more types of elements on a PDF. On top of the already supported texts and images, you can now draw different shapes such as line segments, rectangles, circles, and ellipses, with some starter level of styling you could customize for each. I plan on continuously expand this feature so that we can have more elements to draw and more styling to customize in the future.</li> <li>The <a href=\"https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/v4.1/\">docs site</a> has been revamped, it was completely rebuilt using the Material for MkDocs theme. Previously it was just using the default Read the Docs theme that came with MkDocs. While it's simple and minimal, it lacked critical features for what I consider a production ready project's documentation. With the new theme, you should have a much better time navigating through the docs with better syntax highlighting, searching, layouts, etc. Also the docs site is now versioned, as it should for a long time.</li> <li>You can now embed JavaScript code into form fields using PyPDFForm. This is a beta feature that just got rolled out in v4.1. The reason it's beta is that...it may not be secure, and I debated for a while whether to offer this or not. I decided to do so because in the end, you could always do it, and PyPDFForm is just making it simpler. So if all things go well, you can use JavaScript to make your PDF forms more dynamic with your own creativity.</li> <li>To further prove the level of dynamic you could achieve with PyPDFForm, I spent this past weekend hacked together a POC project which, <a href=\"https://github.com/chinapandaman/pdf-tic-tac-toe\">literally lets you play Tic-tac-toe on a PDF form</a>.</li> </ol> <p>If you find this interesting, feel free to checkout the project's <a href=\"https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm\">GitHub repo</a>, its <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/PyPDFForm/\">PyPi page</a>, and its <a href=\"https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/\">documentation</a>. And like always, I hope you guys find the library helpful for your own PDF generation workflow. Feel free to try it, test it, leave comments or suggestions, and open issues. And of course if you are willing, kindly give me a star on GitHub (I'm INCHES away from 1k stars so do it :D).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chinapandaman\"> /u/chinapandaman </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4n4yd/pypdfform_v411_has_released/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4n4yd/pypdfform_v411_has_released/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What My Project Does:</p> <p><strong>AmzPy</strong> is a Python library designed to scrape Amazon product details and search results without needing official PA-API access.</p> <p>It specifically solves the common &quot;bot detection&quot; issue by using <code>curl_cffi</code> for browser impersonation. Instead of standard <code>requests</code>, it mimics the TLS/JA3 fingerprints of real browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox), making it much harder for Amazon to block your requests.</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/theonlyanil/amzpy\">https://github.com/theonlyanil/amzpy</a></p> <p><strong>PyPI:</strong> <code>pip install amzpy</code></p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This is intended for <strong>developers and data researchers</strong> who need to build MVPs, price trackers, or affiliate tools but have been denied Amazon PA-API access or find the official API's limitations too restrictive for early-stage development.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Vs. Official PA-API:</strong> Doesn't require manual approval or maintaining a specific sales volume to keep your keys active.</li> <li><strong>Vs. Scrapy/BeautifulSoup:</strong> Standard scrapers often get hit with CAPTCHAs immediately. AmzPy uses <code>curl_cffi</code> to bypass these hurdles natively. PLUS, amzpy handles beautifulsoup stuff well.</li> <li><strong>Vs. Selenium/Playwright:</strong> AmzPy is much lighter and faster as it doesn't require spinning up a full headless browser instance.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Basic Usage:</strong></p> <pre><code>from amzpy import AmazonScraper scraper = AmazonScraper(country_code=&quot;in&quot;) products = scraper.search_products(query=&quot;gaming mouse&quot;, max_pages=1) for item in products: print(f&quot;{item['title']} - {item['price']}&quot;) </code></pre> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on my library...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/convicted_redditor\"> /u/convicted_redditor </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4i3yu/amzpy_an_amazon_scraper_born_out_of_api/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4i3yu/amzpy_an_amazon_scraper_born_out_of_api/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Also curious how the tradeoff between accuracy and FP is managed for actual applications. They're not pushing any products but are just interested in how Python programmers would solve face recognition tasks. If you are interested in this field, you are likely to google FaceSeek or something similar anyway.

    "title": "Alpha oscillations and aperiodic neural dynamics jointly predict visual temporal resolution, confidence, and dependence on prior experience",
    "content": "Perception requires integrating sensory input over time to construct coherent experiences. Alpha oscillations have been proposed to define the temporal resolution of perception, yet empirical evidence remains inconsistent. Here we combined a sustained visual integration paradigm with resting-state EEG to investigate how oscillatory and aperiodic neural dynamics jointly shape temporal perception. Participants (n=83) viewed alternating gratings that varied in alternation speed, producing the perception of either a fused plaid (integration) or two interchanging gratings (segregation). Faster individual alpha rhythms were associated with narrower temporal integration windows, and a steeper aperiodic spectrum predicted greater perceptual precision. Moreover, individuals with slower alpha frequencies and flatter spectra showed stronger reliance on prior judgments, suggesting reduced sensory precision and increased weighting of recent experience. Subjective confidence increased with faster alpha rhythms, reflecting the clarity of sensory evidence and its consistency with prior responses. Together, these findings show that the perceptual interpretation, confidence and previous experience effects in temporal integration reflect the joint influence of alpha rhythms and aperiodic neural activity. Mechanistically, faster alpha rhythms and lower neural noise may enhance perceptual resolution by generating more precise sampling frames per time unit, leading to finer temporal perception, reduced reliance on prior experience, and greater confidence.",

    "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
    "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

    "title": "Differential modulation of aversive signaling by expectation across the cingulate cortex",
    "content": "Pain-related aversion is an affective-motivational state driven by sensory experience that promotes learning and recruits widespread cortical networks, yet how distinct cingulate subregions contribute to its adaptive utility remains poorly understood. Here we used longitudinal one-photon calcium imaging in mice to compare dynamics in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) across repeated unsignaled foot-shocks and fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Both regions contained relatively stable ensembles that responded robustly to shocks, indicating shared encoding of acute nociceptive events. However, only the RSC flexibly reorganized its population activity when shocks were preceded by predictive cues. These anticipatory dynamics in the RSC predicted the rate of fear learning across individuals and subsequent extinction. By contrast, the ACC maintained shock-responsive ensembles with limited cue modulation. Instead, its dynamics encoded decisions to freeze, aligning with its role in encoding ongoing nociception and driving immediate defensive behavior. Together, these results reveal a division of labor in which the ACC emphasizes ongoing nociceptive processing, while the RSC transforms sensory signals into predictive codes that shape learning and memory. This specialization highlights how distributed cortical computations cooperate to generate the adaptive value of aversion. More broadly, our findings suggest that these regions assume complementary roles to address immediate sensory-motivational responses while flexibly reconfiguring to support long-term behavioral adaptation.",

    "title": "PKM\u03b6-KIBRA interactions, molecular turnover, and memory",
    "content": "How can the molecules that strengthen synaptic connections maintain memory in the face of molecular turnover? Our previous work showed that persistent interaction between the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, KIBRA, and the autonomously active PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is crucial for maintaining synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory for at least a month. This duration is longer than the lifespans of individual KIBRA and PKM{zeta} molecules. Biophysical modeling of the interaction suggests oligomers of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} dimers, but not individual dimers or monomers, can overcome molecular turnover by continually incorporating newly synthesized KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, replacing those that have degraded. Here we used AlphaFold 3 to predict the structures of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} heterodimers and heterohexamers and to examine the sites of action of two structurally distinct inhibitors of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} interaction that disrupt established late-LTP and long-term memory. The structures predict that the peptide K-ZAP blocks formation of heterodimers, whereas the small molecule {zeta}-stat prevents PKM{zeta} of one heterodimer from binding a second KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, essential for forming larger oligomeric structures. We show that {zeta}-stat, like K-ZAP, disrupts 1-month-old spatial memory. Thus, continual formation of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} oligomers can be a core molecular mechanism driving the persistence of long-term memory in the face of molecular turnover.",

    "title": "The IKC-leptin axis functions as a molecular bridge between neurodevelopment and endocrine signaling",
    "content": "Kcnb1, a voltage-gated K+ channel widely expressed in brain, assembles with integrins to form integrin-K+ channel complexes (IKCs) in cortex and hypothalamus. Pathogenic KCNB1 variants cause Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE), and Kcnb1-null (Null) mice reproduce core neurodevelopmental defects alongside chronic hypoleptinemia, suggesting a leptin-IKC signaling axis. We find that Kcnb1, integrins, and the leptin receptor (LepR) co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize in cortical neurons. Perinatal leptin supplementation in Null mice improves cognition, corrects cortical anatomy, and restores neuronal migration, dendritic arborization, and synaptic functionality. In primary Null cortical neurons, leptin normalizes dendritic growth and actin remodeling via integrin-dependent mechanisms. By contrast, leptin has modest effects in WT animals and neurons; sensitivity is unmasked by pharmacological manipulation of integrins, and, strikingly, LepR blockade in the absence of exogenous leptin is sufficient to induce Null-like defects in WT neurons. These findings argue that hypoleptinemia alone does not drive the Null phenotype. Instead, they reveal a previously unrecognized, dual-mode model in which LepR signaling is regulated by both its ligand and IKCs. This conceptual advance links IKC-LepR coupling to neurodevelopment and DEE and pinpoints their interface as a tractable therapeutic target.",

    "title": "The individuality of single-frame functional brain connectivity",
    "content": "Converging evidence from studies on brain network fingerprinting and precision functional mapping suggest that brain networks are highly individualized in functionally meaningful ways. Concurrently with a growth in studies on this topic, there has been a rise in interest on dynamics (approximately second-to-second changes) in brain networks within scan sessions. While analyses of traditional static networks have increasingly grown towards emphasizing the importance of individual differences in brain network topology, studies of dynamic networks typically follow methodology that require brain states to be considered at a group level. In this work, we explore the extent to which brain states are shared across groups of people or unique to individuals using dynamic fingerprinting, an extension of existing fingerprinting methodology meant for dynamic networks. We estimate connectivity at individual volumes using phase coherence. We find that the identity of participants can be predicted with high accuracy based on single volumes given sufficient database scan data. We find that having more highly parcellated atlases facilitates individual identification. Finally, we find that tasks can be identified more readily within subjects than between subjects. We conclude that not only are trajectories between brain states unique to individuals (as previous work suggests), but also the instantaneous states that individuals inhabit are distinct. Further, the instantaneous neural correlates of a task appear to be more consistent within subjects than between subjects. This underlines the importance of considering individual variability in studies of brain network dynamics.",

    "content": "Emotions in speech are conveyed through both semantics and prosody--voice 'melody', yet how listeners integrate these cues in the brain remains unclear. We investigated non-literal forms of speech, such as irony and sarcasm, where understanding beyond literal meaning relies on the dynamic interplay between affective prosodic and semantic cues, alongside theory of mind (ToM). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants listened to short dialogues between two characters, which varied in prosody and semantics to convey either literal or non-literal meanings. Behaviorally, semantics and prosody interacted in shaping participants' evaluations, although the data suggest a prosody dominance effect. Non-literal speech engaged the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, temporal speech regions, and ToM areas, while integration-demanding tasks (e.g., irony, sarcasm, ToM) evoked stronger ToM-network activation than prosody or semantics tasks. Taken together, our data clarify the behavioral and neural underpinnings of the integration of prosody and semantics in non-literal speech and open new venues in this field.",

    "title": "Gliomas preferentially develop within the action-mode network",
    "content": "Gliomas tend to arise in specific brain regions and may integrate into functional circuits, suggesting they could be regulated by brain activity. However, it remains unclear whether glioma growth is related to system-level brain networks. Analyzing neuroimaging data from three datasets including 1,310 patients with cerebral gliomas, we identified and replicated a functionally connected glioma network, which overlaps with the action-mode network (AMN), somatomotor network (SMN), and action-related subcortical regions. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the AMN successfully predicted the location of glioma occurrence in two independent datasets with complex tumor distributions. Remarkably, no patient had a glioma entirely outside the AMN, and over 89% of patients exhibited gliomas with at least 50% overlap with the network. Moreover, the spatial overlap between glioma location and the AMN demonstrated significant prognostic value in survival analyses, with higher AMN-tumor overlap associated with poorer overall survival. Notably, the acetylcholine transporter, a key player in glioma pathogenesis that drives transcriptional reprogramming, showed an expression pattern overlapping with the AMN. Meta-analytic annotations further linked the glioma network to processes of action initiation, execution, and feedback. These findings indicate that gliomas preferentially arise in circuits involved in action and highlight the central role of the AMN in glioma pathophysiology and growth.",

    "title": "Controllable Point-Light Displays Implemented in a game engine for biological motion research",
    "content": "Biological motion perception plays a critical role in survival and social communication across species. Point-light displays (PLDs), which represent body movement using only a small set of joint markers, have long served as an effective tool for isolating motion cues from other visual features. However, existing methods for generating PLDs, ranging from filmed actors with reflective markers to markerless motion extraction and motion-capture datasets, present limitations in cost, accessibility, flexibility, or ecological validity. In particular, many laboratories lack the resources to create customizable stimuli that allow systematic manipulation of movement parameters. In this article, we introduce a practical and easily modifiable method for producing fully controllable 3D PLDs using freely available animation rigs and the Unity game engine. Our approach enables real-time control of depth cues and directional motion without the need for motion capture equipment or specialized filming environments. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we conducted a psychophysical experiment comparing the perception of biological and non-biological motion. The results replicate the well-documented forward-motion perceptual bias for biological stimuli and highlight differences in how observers interpret motion direction across stimulus classes. This method offers a convenient, accessible, and adaptable tool for research on motion perception and social cognition.",

    "title": "Regional Hypothalamic Responses to Light Vary Across Developmental Stages but Remain Stable with Time of Day",
    "content": "Background: Light plays a significant role in regulating various non-visual biological processes, such as stimulating alertness and cognition. However, the precise subcortical neural pathways are not fully established, including within the hypothalamus. In particular, how the hypothalamus processes are modulated by time-of-day and developmental stages, remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine in vivo the impact of different light illuminance (0.16, 37, 92, and 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance: mel-EDI lux) on the activity of the hypothalamus of healthy young adults (N=33; 20 women; 24.3 +/- 3.2y) and adolescents (N=16; 5 women; 16.8 +/- 1.1y) while they completed an auditory executive task, in the morning or in the evening. Results: Performance to the task improved with increasing illuminance irrespective of time of day and age group. When focusing on time-of-day differences in young adults, we found that the regional impact of light illuminance on the activity of the hypothalamus was consistent between the morning and the evening, with the posterior and anterior hypothalamus, respectively, showing increased and decreased activity with increasing illuminance. When focusing on developmental stages differences, during the evening session only, we found similar regional patterns in adolescents and young adult. The magnitude of the response at the highest illuminance was, however, larger in adolescents, with a larger deactivation of the superior-anterior and inferior-tubular hypothalamus. Conclusions: These findings reveal a complex and non-uniform impact of light on hypothalamus activity and provide novel insights into how light influences vary with developmental stages.",

SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Structural basis of CO2 valence coding in Drosophila",
    "content": "In the olfactory system, glomerular sensory channels of single receptor identity support reliable odor recognition for appropriate approach or avoidance behaviors. For many olfactory stimuli, the assigned sensory value is innate but weighted by the internal state and previous experiences. How context-dependent modulation of innate valence coding supports distinct behavioral responses is poorly understood. Here we show that CO2 sensory information in Drosophila, intrinsically aversive but modified by attractive food signals, diverges from the canonical glomerular channel already in the antennal lobe via the polarized local interneuron LN23. LN23 relays sensory input via an extraglomerular CO2 pathway and manipulation of LN23 activity revealed a dominant role in CO2-induced avoidance behavior. The extraglomerular CO2 pathway projects to the posterior lateral protocerebrum (PLP) adjacent to the canonical Lateral Horn (LH) olfactory processing center and segregates into anatomically distinct valence channels. Connectome data together with functional characterization showed the convergence of parallel CO2 channels onto two interconnected 3rd order neurons which integrate additional sensory modalities via distinct mechanisms: while the glomerular CO2 pathway converge with food relay neurons onto separated dendritic domains of the PD5 interneuron in the LH, the extraglomerular pathways integrating CO2 information with antennal humidity and temperature modalities establish antagonistic inputs onto the PLP interneuron PV9. This early anatomical divergence of a defined olfactory channel followed by separated multimodal integration provides a structural basis for context-dependent valence coding and appropriate behavioral responses.",

    "content": "Choice-related neural activity, reflecting trial-by-trial correlation with subjects perceptual choice, is commonly observed in sensory cortices and has been implied in sensory readout. Recent studies suggest an alternative source from motor-reporting, yet its precise nature remain elusive due to limitations in conventional experimental paradigms. Here we quantitatively identified motor component by training macaques to discriminate visual motion directions via making saccade to spatial-independent, colored choice targets appeared under two contexts: at stimulus onset, or after its offset. Neural recordings in visual areas MT/MST revealed a dominant motor-related choice signal when the saccade goal was known in advance; this signal vanished with delayed target onset. By comparing with downstream sensory-motor transformation areas and employing a recurrent network model, we demonstrated that this motor component reflected feedback. Our work clarifies that a major portion of \"decision\" activity in sensory neurons is attributable to motor-reporting processes, highlighting the profound influence of behavioral context.",

    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "content": "<p>Hi HN, I recently shared this on r/BCI and wanted to see what the engineering community here thinks.<p>A while back, I got frustrated with the state of accessible BCI hardware. Research gear was wildly unaffordable. So, I spent a ton of time designing a custom board, software and firmware to bridge that gap. I call it the Cerelog ESP-EEG. It is open-source (Firmware + Schematics), and I designed it specifically to fix the signal integrity issues found in most DIY hardware.<p>I believe in sharing the work. You can find the Schematics, Firmware, and Software setup on the GitHub repo:\nGITHUB LINK: <a href=\"https://github.com/Cerelog-ESP-EEG/ESP-EEG\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Cerelog-ESP-EEG/ESP-EEG</a><p>For those who don't want to deal with BGA soldering or sourcing components, I do have assembled units available: <a href=\"https://www.cerelog.com/eeg_researchers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.cerelog.com/eeg_researchers.html</a><p>The major features: Forked/modified OpenBCI GUI Compatibility as well as Brainflow API, and LSL Compatibility. I know a lot of us rely on the OpenBCI GUI for visualization because it just works. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, so I ensured this board supports it natively.<p>It works out of the box: I maintain a forked modified version of the GUI that connects to the board via LSL (Lab Streaming Layer). Zero coding required: You can visualize FFTs, Spectrograms, and EMG widgets immediately without writing a single line of Python.<p>The \"active bias\" (why my signal is cleaner): The TI ADS1299 is the gold standard for EEG, but many dev boards implement it incorrectly. They often leave the Bias feedback loop \"open\" (passive), which makes them terrible at rejecting 60Hz mains hum. I simply followed the datasheet: I implemented a True Closed-Loop Active Bias (Drive Right Leg).<p>How it works: It measures the common-mode signal, inverts it, and actively drives it back into the body. The result: Cleaner data<p>Tech stack:<p><pre><code>  ADC: TI ADS1299 (24-bit, 8-channel).\n\n  MCU: ESP32 Chosen to handle high-speed SPI and WiFi/USB streaming\n\n  Software: BrainFlow support (Python, C++, Java, C#) for those who want to build custom ML pipelines, LSL support, and forked version of OpenBCI GUI support\n</code></pre>\nThis was a huge project for me. I\u2019m happy to geek out about getting the ESP32 to stream reliably at high sample rates as both the software and firmware for this project proved a lot more challenging than I expected. Let me know what you think!<p>SAFETY NOTE:\nI strongly recommend running this on a LiPo battery via WiFi.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Elements of Olfactory Intelligence in Drosophila",
    "content": "The ability to make the world of odorants intelligible is a key capability of the Drosophila olfactory system that we shall call olfactory intelligence. We argue that olfactory intelligence does not only arise in the form of associative learning in the Mushroom Body, but can be seen throughout the first three stages of the early olfactory system: the Antenna, the Antennal Lobe and the Mushroom Body Calyx, where encoding and processing of odorants take places. Characterizing the structure and logic of the code underlying the spike trains accessing the memory in the Mushroom Body is a major challenge in neuroscience. To address this challenge and unveil the key elements of olfactory intelligence, we extensively model the function of the Drosophila early olfactory system from its intriguing connectome. We start by modeling the space of odorants using constructs of both semantic and syntactic information. Odorant semantics concerns the identity of odorants while odorant syntax pertains to their concentration amplitude. These odorant attributes are multiplicatively coupled in the process of olfactory transduction. To make the world of odorants intelligible, we establish that the Drosophila Antennal Lobe and Calyx largely reduce the concentration dependency of the odorant information from the confounding representation of the Antenna, and thereby disentangle the odorant semantic information from the odorant syntactic information. We also introduce a novel time and rank-based representation of Kenyon Cell (KC) outputs, called the marked first spike sequence code. We compare the cumulative inter-spike interval statistics of odorant semantics and introduce a novel distance measure for the accurate classification of odorant semantics. Computationally, these elements of olfactory intelligence are realized by a class of differential divisive normalization processors (DNPs) modeling the feedback circuits in the Antennal Lobe facilitated by Local Neurons and in the Calyx by the Anterior Paired Lateral (APL) neuron. The marked first spike sequence code at the output of the DNP circuit of the Calyx provides a novel representation of the odorant semantics. The code reflects the amplitude ranking that drives the KCs in the time domain. Strikingly, the APL feedback not only removes the concentration dependency of the KC outputs, but also increases the ranking distance between the marked first spike sequence codes representing different odorant identities. Thus, the rank-based representation supports accurate classification of odorant semantics.",

    "title": "Ultrashort optical-pin excitation for scattering brain imaging",
    "content": "Imaging neural structures deep in brain tissue is central to understanding brain function, yet remains fundamentally limited by strong optical scattering and the requirement for accurate three-dimensional (3D) optical sectioning. Laser-scanning microscopy is a promising technique for brain imaging; however, maintaining excitation focus integrity in scattering media while preserving axial confinement poses a persistent photonic challenge. Here we introduce the optical pin, an ultrashort excitation regime engineered at the angular-spectrum level to address this limitation. By broadening the transverse angular bandwidth of a Bessel-type field while preserving its conical momentum-space architecture, the optical pin introduces a controlled longitudinal wave-vector spread that compresses the axial interference length to the micrometer scale, restoring Gaussian-like sectioning without sacrificing multi-angle interference. This excitation design yields substantially enhanced imaging performance, including ~1.5-fold contrast improvement and ~2.6-fold increased robustness to scattering. We validate the approach across transparent, scattering, and biological specimens, including bead phantoms, C. elegans, and mouse brain tissue. As a system-level excitation strategy, the optical pin is readily compatible with existing laser-scanning microscopy platforms and is particularly suited for scattering-limited brain imaging.",

    "content": "Motivation: Early detection of cognitive strain is essential for identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and its progression to more severe neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigates cognitive strain in MCI by examining both behavioral and neural correlates during a real-world task. Methods: Twenty-four older adults (M=69, 14 male, 10 female), including 11 with MCI and 13 healthy controls (MMSE >22/30), performed a spatial navigation task under varying memory load. We recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to capture error-related potentials (ErrPs), which reflect cognitive load and processing errors. Results: Both groups showed a decline in working memory performance as cognitive load increased ({beta} = -41.39, SE = 10.73, t(90) = -3.86, p < .001). MCI participants, however, exhibited more efficient use of non-intrinsic (allocentric) reference frames under high cognitive load ({beta} = 2.47, SE = 0.95, t(82) = 2.61, p = .009). MCI individuals also displayed larger ErrPs in central brain regions, indicating greater neural resource allocation. Additionally, MCI participants showed a decrease in parietal-to-frontal theta dominance under high load ({beta} = -0.68, SE = 0.32, t(90) = -2.12, p = .037), and reduced fronto-parietal connectivity. Discussion: These findings suggest that MCI participants experience greater cognitive strain, evidenced by increased neural resource allocation and strategy-shifting under load. This heightened strain may serve as an early marker of MCI progression, offering potential for early detection of pathological changes.",

    "title": "Facilitating the Supplementary Motor Area Activity Reduces Variability of Ball Arrival Position in Accurate Ball Throwing Performance",
    "content": "Maintaining high accuracy during rapid, dynamic movements is a significant challenge for the central nervous system. The supplementary motor area (SMA) is a key cortical region for orchestrating motor commands and regulating movement variability, yet its causal role in maintaining precision during high-speed tasks remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated the impact of modulating SMA excitability on throwing performance in fourteen healthy novices. Participants performed maximal and submaximal (50% effort) throwing tasks before and after receiving intermittent (facilitatory) or continuous (inhibitory) theta burst stimulation (TBS) over the SMA. Outcome measures included ball speed, variability of pitch location--quantified as variable error (95% confidence ellipse area) and absolute error (Euclidean distance from the ellipse center to the target)--and introspective ratings of performance via visual analog scales (VAS). Results showed that intermittent TBS (iTBS) significantly reduced the variable error of pitch location during maximal-effort throwing--where neural noise is theoretically elevated--without compromising ball speed. In contrast, no significant changes in performance were observed following continuous TBS or during the submaximal throwing task. Notably, objective precision gains under iTBS were dissociated from subjective ratings of accuracy, which increased globally over time independent of stimulation type. These findings demonstrate that the SMA plays a critical causal role in stabilizing motor output under high motor drive. This study suggests that SMA-mediated stabilization operates as a subconscious process, offering new insights for optimizing complex motor skills.",

This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals.

    "title": "Differential Effects of 5-HT7 Receptor Signaling in the Noradrenergic System in a Rat Model of Treatment-Resistant Depression",
    "content": "Introduction: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major clinical challenge, and its neurobiological basis remains unclear. The locus coeruleus (LC), a key noradrenergic hub, shows altered activity in TRD models, and serotonergic 5-HT7 receptors have emerged as potential modulators of this circuit. Methods: We assessed the impact of 5-HT7 receptor activation on LC function in Wistar Kyoto rats, an established TRD model, using in vivo extracellular recordings, in vitro patch-clamp assays, and receptor expression analysis. Results: Systemic administration of AS19, a selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist, increased LC neuronal firing in both strains, with a significantly greater effect in Wistar Kyoto rats. This response was prevented by a 5-HT7 antagonist confirming receptor specificity. Glutamatergic blockade altered AS19 effects in a strain-dependent manner, whereas in vitro assays revealed no differential postsynaptic modulation and similar presynaptic inhibition across groups. Western blot analysis showed elevated 5-HT7 receptor expression in the LC, ventral hippocampus, and amygdala of Wistar Kyoto rats, alongside reduced expression in the prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: These findings indicate that 5-HT7 receptor activation exerts complex, circuit-dependent modulation of LC activity, influenced by glutamatergic and serotonergic inputs. Enhanced receptor expression in limbic regions and altered LC responsiveness may contribute to TRD pathophysiology and highlight 5-HT7 signaling as a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "Humanized Kcnv2 E151X Mouse Captures Hallmarks of KCNV2-Associated Retinal Dystrophy",
    "content": "Background: KCNV2-associated retinopathy is a rare inherited retinal dystrophy caused by variants in the KCNV2 gene, leading to disrupted photoreceptor function and slowly progressive vision loss. Patients have characteristic electroretinography abnormalities, including reduced cone responses, delayed and reduced rod responses to low light flashes and paradoxically large rod-driven responses to bright flashes of light. To model this condition, we generated the Kcnv2 E151X mouse line and assessed its structural and functional retinal features. Methods: We have employed CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing technology to generate a mouse line with an early stop mutation in position E151 - orthologous to the commonly encountered E143X mutation in humans - and performed a combination of immunohistochemistry and Western Blot to confirm the absence of the full-length KCNV2-encoded protein, Kv8.2. To assess how closely it models the human disease, we have characterised the KCNV2 mutant mouse line at histological and functional levels employing immunohistochemistry and electroretinography, respectively. Results: Kcnv2 mutant mice showed markedly reduced photopic responses and reproduced the supernormal rod phenotype as described in affected individuals. In the morphological context, mutant retinas demonstrated strong and early glial fibrillary acidic protein upregulation together with reduced counts of cone arrestin positive cells as well as photoreceptors in general. Conclusions: The Kcnv2 mutant mouse line replicates key functional and structural hallmarks of KCNV2-associated retinopathy. This model provides a relevant platform for mechanistic studies and preclinical evaluation of gene based or pharmacological therapies targeting cone and rod photoreceptor dysfunction.",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

    "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
    "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "title": "Low perioperative hemoglobin as an independent detrimental predictor of functional outcome after basal ganglia hemorrhage: development and validation of a composite prognostic model",
    "content": "BackgroundBasal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) is a life-threatening neurosurgical emergency associated with substantial mortality and disability. Accurate postoperative prognosis assessment remains challenging due to multifactorial influences. Hemoglobin (HB), as the key determinant of oxygen delivery, may play a critical role in neurological recovery, yet the prognostic significance of perioperative HB fluctuations in BGH has not been fully elucidated.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 213 surgically treated BGH patients from 2020 to 2023 was analyzed. Perioperative HB indices, including preoperative (Pre-HB), postoperative (Post-HB), and mean HB (Mean-HB) levels, were evaluated alongside clinical data. Functional outcome at 6 months was determined based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression together with multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to screen for independent risk variables, followed by construction of a composite predictive model. Model discrimination, calibration, and evaluation of the model\u2019s clinical applicability were conducted using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsPatients with poor prognosis exhibited significantly lower Pre-HB, Post-HB, and Mean-HB levels (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed these variables as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The proposed model provides a practical and data-driven tool that demonstrated good predictive performance (AUC = 0.84) in a single-center retrospective cohort. Calibration and DCA demonstrated good consistency and potential clinical applicability.ConclusionPerioperative declines in HB are independently associated with poor postoperative outcomes in BGH. The proposed HB-integrated model provides a reliable, dynamic tool for individualized risk prediction, facilitating precision perioperative management and optimized recovery strategies.",

    "content": "BackgroundMultiple studies have examined bimanual coordination in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) with few in bilateral CP and none utilized electroencephalography (EEG). This study investigates brain activation underlying bimanual performance in individuals with bilateral CP and typical development (TD).MethodsTwenty-six participants (13 CP; 13 TD) completed the Box and Block Test (BBT) and visually cued drumming tasks with each hand (unimanual) and then with both hands synchronously and asynchronously (bimanual). EEG and motion data were recorded during drumming tasks.ResultsChildren with CP demonstrated bilateral impairments in drumming cadence and BBT, increased alpha and beta and decreased gamma EEG band activation in mainly non-dominant brain regions compared to TD. Bimanual tasks tended to show decreased performance and greater alpha and beta band activation than unimanual tasks for both groups. EEG activity and BBT correlations were positive in TD, but negative in CP.DiscussionThis study showed that children with CP had worse motor performance bilaterally and EEG activation differences from TD similar to previous unimanual findings in bilateral CP, however, a more complex bimanual task may have uncovered greater differences.ConclusionEvidence of bimanual deficits and EEG differences reinforces the need for greater research and clinical attention on upper limb function in bilateral CP.",

    "content": "ObjectivesGlaucoma is an irreversible progressive optic neuropathy characterized by neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells. Elevated intraocular pressure induces mechanical stress and strain at the optic nerve head, impairing axonal function and contributing to the onset and progression of glaucoma. This study aims to generalize and visualize the dynamic evolution and research hotspots of glaucoma biomechanics through bibliometric methods.MethodsAll documents about glaucoma biomechanics research in 2000\u20132024 were extracted from two databases (Web of Science Core Collection and PubMed). The hotspots and frontiers of research in terms of remarkable countries, authors, journals, keywords, and cited references were analyzed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer programs.ResultsA collection of 1,655 English articles was included, with a steady increase in annual publications. 4,464 authors from 51 countries/regions were identified, led by the United States. Ethier CR was the most prolific contributor, while Downs JC was the most commonly cited author. Among 203 journals, Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science both led in publications and citations. In the domain of glaucoma biomechanics, keywords \u201clamina cribrosa,\u201d \u201copen angle glaucoma,\u201d and \u201cbiomechanical properties\u201d exhibited the significant centrality. The cited references formed 7 clusters, namely #0 (optic nerve head), #1 (ocular response analyzer), #2 (sclera), #3 (tonometry), #4 (lamina cribrosa), #5 (trabecular meshwork), and #6 (corneal biomechanics).ConclusionOur study employed bibliometric and visualization analyses to state the biomechanical mechanisms underlying intraocular pressure regulation and optic nerve damage, offering the development in the field of glaucoma biomechanics. Future directions may focus on the interdisciplinary applications of artificial intelligence, tissue engineering and novel biomaterials in glaucoma pathogenesis and therapies.",

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to quantify Sylvian fissure angle (SFA) development via fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and establish the reference range and growth curve during normal pregnancy.Materials and methodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study collected 324 singleton fetuses at 22\u201338\u202fweeks of gestation (GA), without abnormal signs on MRI or chromosomal defects, from January 2022 to December 2023. Six SFAs were defined and measured: Sylvian fissure plateau angle (SFPA), Sylvian fissure anterior rotation angle (SFARA), and Sylvian fissure posterior rotation angle (SFPRA) in the transthalamic axial plane, and SFPA, Sylvian fissure superior rotation angle (SFSRA), and Sylvian fissure inferior rotation angle (SFIRA) in the third ventricular coronal plane. Then, the correlation between the SFAs and GA was analyzed, and the growth curve model was used. Retrospective cortical malformation cases validated the model. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate interobserver variability of the SFA measurements.ResultsICC for SFA measurements demonstrated good reliability (0.772\u20130.976). The bilateral SFARA and SFSRA were significantly positively associated with GA (r\u202f=\u202f0.914, 0.926, 0.842, 0.836, left to right, all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The bilateral SFPRA, SFIRA, and SFPA (both axial and coronal views) were negatively associated with GA (r value range: \u22120.601 to \u22120.145, all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For each SFA and GA, the quadratic curve has the best goodness of fit. The model detected cortical malformation (genetically confirmed). Except for the SFARA, all SFAs were statistically different between the two sides.ConclusionThe dynamic development of the fetal SFA can be well evaluated using MRI. The SFA\u2019s reference range will enhance the accuracy of fetal brain assessment and offer a quantitative reference framework for identifying deviations suggestive of cortical malformations.",

    "title": "Rhythm increases perceptual tolerance when measuring electrically evoked compound action potentials in cochlear implant recipients",
    "content": "In cochlear implant (CI) recipients, measurement of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) is used in clinical routine to prove the electrode-nerve interface and to support fitting, especially in very young children. To record an ECAP amplitude growth function (AGF), electrical stimuli are presented at increasing intensities up to the maximum acceptable loudness (MAL). However, a continuously monotonically rising sound can quickly be perceived as unpleasant and thus impair the success rate of ECAP threshold determination. The present study investigates whether perceptual and objective parameters, which are involved in ECAP measurements, depend on the type of stimulus presentation. In 27 subjects with a CI (28 implants), stimuli of five different AGF patterns were presented ten times in random order at a medial electrode contact, resulting in a total of 50 AGFs per implant. One pattern (Pclin) in which the stimuli increase strictly monotonically is already implemented in the clinical software (MAESTRO). The present study also employed rhythmic patterns and patterns with pauses. The behavioral threshold (THR), the maximum comfortable level (MCL), the MAL, and objective ECAP threshold were analyzed. ECAP threshold values did not change significantly when different stimulus paradigms were applied. Rhythmic AGF patterns were perceived as less unpleasant and enabled a higher MAL compared to Pclin. This in turn led to improved ECAP threshold determination, with the success rate rising to 86.7%, compared to 79.1% for Pclin.",

    "title": "Effects of fatigue on motor unit characteristics in isometric elbow contractions across age groups",
    "content": "This study aims to investigate the neuromuscular regulation mechanisms in different age groups under conditions of fatigue. A total of 50 participants aged between 10 and 80\u202fyears were recruited and divided into 11 different age groups. Each participant performed a triangular wave isometric contraction before and after fatigue. The convolution kernel compensation algorithm was employed to extract the motor unit (MU) spike trains from the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles. The extracted features included root mean square, mean power frequency, motor unit action potential (MUAP) peak-to-peak values, MUAP duration, recruitment threshold, derecruitment threshold, discharge frequency, and common neural drive, which were compared across age groups before and after fatigue. Significant variations in fatigue adaptation were observed among age groups, according to the study. Adults tend to recruit larger motor units to compensate for fatigue-induced strength decline. The elderly group\u2019s discharge frequency and MU recruitment threshold, on the other hand, did not significantly change, indicating that their neuromuscular system was less able to adjust to fatigue. The child group may have relied more on discharge frequency modulation during fatigue because they displayed smaller variations in recruitment threshold. At the same time, PCA results showed that fatigue induced a greater reduction in common-drive coherence in children and older adults, suggesting that maintaining coordinated neural drive becomes more challenging during development and aging. This study clarifies the differences in neuromuscular fatigue adaptation mechanisms at different stages of life and reveals the changing patterns of MU regulation strategies across the examined age range. The resulting age-dependent MU patterns provide an important physiological reference for neurological healthcare, facilitating clearer identification and interpretation of deviations associated with neuromuscular and neurological disorders.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo examine the associations between superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and the burden of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), as well as vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), in elderly patients.MethodsIn this study, a cohort of 286 elderly individuals was included. Each participant received a comprehensive cognitive assessment. Plasma SOD levels were evaluated. The cumulative CSVD burden was quantified using an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, based on four key imaging indicators of CSVD: white matter hyperintensity, deep cerebral microbleeds, lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia. To evaluate the associations among SOD levels, CSVD burden, and cognitive function, we employed binary logistic regression analysis, tests for trend, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and mediation analysis.ResultsAfter adjusting for potential confounders, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated levels of SOD were significantly associated with a reduced risk of VaMCI (OR: 0.919; 95% CI: 0.896\u20130.943; P < 0.001) and a lower likelihood of severe CSVD burden (OR: 0.980; 95% CI: 0.968\u20130.992; P = 0.001) in elderly patients. Compared with the lowest quartile of SOD levels, the OR for VaMCI in the highest quartile of SOD levels was 0.039 (95% CI: 0.016\u20130.100; P for trend < 0.001) after adjusting for potential confounders. For severe CSVD burden, the corresponding OR was 0.442 (95% CI: 0.214\u20130.913; P for trend = 0.011). Mediation analysis revealed that the severe CSVD burden significantly moderated the relationship between SOD levels and VaMCI.ConclusionElevated SOD levels serve as a protective factor against severe CSVD burden and VaMCI in elderly patients. A portion of the protective effect of increased SOD on VaMCI may be attributed to its role in mitigating the severity of CSVD.",

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
    "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

The device features several key advantages, including low weight (5 g excluding battery), compact size (30 mm \u00d7 38 mm), and extended battery life (\u2265300 hours). Additionally, it integrates low-power Bluetooth, allowing for real-time wireless adjustment of stimulation parameters, such as frequency (80\u2013150 Hz), pulse width (40\u2013340 \u03bcs), and amplitude (2.3\u20133 V).ResultsThe stimulating effect of this device has been verified in a model of mild Parkinson\u2019s disease (mild Parkinsonism) in rats, indicating that the device is effective in regulating the motor functions of rodents with Parkinson\u2019s disease-like conditions.DiscussionThis wearable DBS device shows broad applicability in behavior-based studies and offers a valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms of various brain nuclei in rodent models.

Effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease requires careful surgical targeting and adjustment of stimulation parameters to avoid motor side effects caused by activation of the internal capsule. Currently, patients must self-report side effects during implantation surgery and device programming\u2014a subjective and inconsistent process that may delay optimized treatment or result in suboptimal therapy. Motor evoked potentials (mEP), the use of electromyography to record DBS-induced muscle activation, offer a promising biomarker for objective motor side effect detection. Approach. We present an automated algorithmic procedure for mEP detection and quantification. Main results. First, we design and evaluate a series of signal processing techniques to accurately detect mEP while mitigating the influence of stimulation artifacts and noise, then demonstrate a strategy for integrating multi-channel EMG responses into a single side effect biomarker (the mEP score). Next, we use data from a large patient cohort of intraoperative recordings (N = 54 subthalamic nucleus (STN) leads) to quantify several physiological features of mEP, including their response frequency, latency, amplitude, and waveform similarity properties. Last, we show that the mEP score responds to DBS amplitude and contact configuration parameters in a manner that is consistent with expected STN-capsular anatomy. Significance.

    "content": "Objective. This study assesses the signal quality of state-of-the-art dry electroencephalography (EEG) under highly challenging, uncontrolled, real-world conditions and compares it to conventional wet EEG. Approach. EEG data from 530 participants recorded during a public exhibition were benchmarked against several established signal quality metrics, including spiking activity, kurtosis, auto-mutual information, spectral entropy, gamma-band power, and parameters extracted using the fitting oscillations and one-over F model. Additionally, ICLabel decomposition was applied to quantify artifact influences across EEG channels. Dry electrode results were compared with their equivalents extracted on two control datasets comprising 71 and 80 participants, respectively, recorded with wet EEG systems in laboratory, home, or clinical surroundings. Main results. The analysis revealed condition-specific susceptibility to artifacts for both EEG modalities. The dry EEG system exhibited substantial robustness in moderate-noise scenarios, with artifact profiles comparable to controlled wet EEG recordings. However, recordings obtained in highly dynamic conditions showed increased muscle artifacts and broadband activity, notably in frontal and temporal regions. Wet EEG systems, under controlled conditions, were overall less inflicted by artifacts, yet, fronto-central ocular and muscular artifacts were consistently present. ICLabel analysis further confirmed these findings, indicating similar proportions of brain-related activity across systems (approximately 31%\u201349.5%), but highlighted increased vulnerability to movement and environmental artifacts in dry EEG during dynamic tasks. Significance. In agreement with recent similar investigations, our findings demonstrate that dry EEG caps have significantly matured, achieving signal quality comparable to wet EEG systems even in challenging real-world conditions, provided appropriate artifact mitigation strategies are employed. These results affirm the practical readiness and broad feasibility of dry EEG technologies for diverse Brain\u2013computer interface applications in naturalistic environments.",

    "content": "Objective. Direct current (DC) electrical block of peripheral sensory axons has potential for clinical applications in pain management. The C-fiber reflex (CFR), elicited via noxious stimulation of the foot, is suitable for investigating the activation of unmyelinated C-fiber nerves, the fiber class that is responsible for lingering pain sensations. Approach. In anesthetized rats, the CFR was elicited via electrical stimulation to the plantar surface of the hindpaw, and the resulting C-fiber-evoked electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded from the ipsilateral biceps femoris muscle. A carbon separated interface nerve electrode was used to deliver DC block to arrest action potentials in the sciatic nerve. The efficacy of the block was observed as a reduction/abolition of the magnitude of the EMG in a time window corresponding to the latency of C-fibers activity. Main results. Complete cessation of nerve activity could be achieved instantaneously by applying DC at the \u2018block threshold (BT)\u2019. At amplitudes below the BT, complete block could be induced over a period of seconds to minutes, with lower currents being correlated with longer induction times. When block was applied for prolonged periods of time, block was sustained following the cessation of DC delivery. This \u2018recovery period\u2019 was longer for longer durations of block application. Significance. The CFR is an established method to investigate pharmaceutical pain therapies, yet to date, has not been used to assess electrical block of sensory axons.

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
    "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "content": "Objective. Speech imagery recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an emerging challenge in brain-computer interfaces, and has important applications, such as in the interaction with locked-in patients. In this work, we use graph signal processing for developing a more effective representation of EEG signals in speech imagery recognition. Approach. We propose a dynamic graph representation that uses multiple graphs constructed based on the time-varying correlations between EEG channels. Our methodology is particularly suitable for signals that exhibit fluctuating correlations, which cannot be adequately modeled through a static (single graph) model. The resultant representation provides graph frequency features that compactly capture the spatial patterns of the underlying multidimensional EEG signal as well as the evolution of spatial relationships over time. These dynamic graph features are fed into an attention-based long short-term memory network for speech imagery recognition. A novel EEG data augmentation method is also proposed for improving training robustness. Main results. Experimental evaluation using a range of experiments shows that the proposed dynamic graph features are more effective than conventional time-frequency features for speech imagery recognition. The overall system outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, yielding accuracy gains of up to 10%. Significance. The dynamic graph representation captures time-varying spatial relationships in EEG signals, overcoming limitations of static graph models and conventional feature extraction. Combined with data augmentation and attention-based classification, it demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in speech imagery recognition.",

    "content": "Objective. Chronically implanted microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are used for stimulating and recording neural activity in research and clinical settings. However, their reliability can be compromised by insufficient encapsulation stability. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), a chemically stable and biocompatible material, has emerged as a potential thin-film encapsulation for MEAs. We aimed to evaluate thin-film a-SiC encapsulation using electrical-accelerated aging (EAA) and to demonstrate a methodology for obtaining acceleration factors for EAA by Weibull analysis. Approach. Interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) encapsulated with a-SiC were subjected to voltage cycling and stepped-voltage protocols to measure leakage currents in buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C. EAA employed incrementally increasing voltage biases over time to induce degradation and reveal failure mechanisms. Main results. IDEs exhibited a significant change in electrical behavior on exposure to saline, with failure initiating at specific voltages and accompanied by gas evolution at defect sites. Incremental voltage biasing revealed a capacitive-to-faradaic transition in leakage current response that was used as a failure criterion. Significance. Acceleration factors for voltage-driven accelerated aging of a-SiC thin-film encapsulation can be obtained by Weibull analysis using a mechanistic failure criterion. Breakdown occurs at processing-related defects in the a-SiC. This study demonstrates the use of EAA for evaluating failure in a-SiC thin-film encapsulation used in implantable MEAs. EAA is broadly applicable to thin-film MEAs and provides a highly relevant method of predicting implanted lifetimes of bioelectronics.",

    "content": "Objective. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort. Approach. Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery. Main results. 26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone. Significance. Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.",

    "title": "The Agentic Leash: Extracting Causal Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with LLMs",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.00097v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.",

While NLP based autograding systems for open-ended response questions have been found to be beneficial for providing immediate feedback, autograders are not always liked, understood, or trusted by students. Our research tested the effect of transparency on students' attitudes towards autograders. Transparent autograders increased students' perceptions of autograder accuracy and willingness to discuss autograders in survey comments, but did not improve other related attitudes -- such as willingness to be graded by them on a test -- relative to the control without transparency. However, this lack of impact may be due to higher measured student trust towards autograders in this study than in prior work in the field. We briefly discuss possible reasons for this trend.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.00670v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) is routinely used in neurocritical care to monitor seizures and other harmful brain activity, including rhythmic and periodic patterns that are clinically significant. Although deep learning methods have achieved high accuracy in seizure detection, most existing approaches remain seizure-centric, rely on discrete-label supervision, and are primarily evaluated using accuracy-based metrics. A central limitation of current EEG modeling practice is the weak correspondence between learned representations and how EEG findings are interpreted and summarized in clinical workflows. Harmful EEG activity exhibits overlapping patterns, graded expert agreement, and temporal persistence, which are not well captured by classification objectives alone. This work proposes a multimodal EEG representation learning framework that integrates signal-domain modeling with structured clinical language supervision. First, raw EEG is transformed into a longitudinal bipolar montage and time-frequency representations. Second, dual transformer-based encoders model complementary temporal and frequency-centric dependencies and are fused using an adaptive gating mechanism. Third, EEG embeddings are aligned with structured expert consensus descriptions through a contrastive objective. Finally, an EEG-conditioned text reconstruction loss is introduced as a representation-level constraint alongside standard classification loss. Experimental evaluation using a controlled train-validation-test split achieves a six-class test accuracy of 0.9797. Ablation analyses show that removing contrastive alignment reduces cross-modal retrieval performance from Recall@10 of 0.3390 to 0.0045, despite minimal change in classification accuracy. These findings demonstrate that discriminative accuracy does not reliably reflect representation quality for clinically meaningful EEG modeling.",

However, many government and non-government websites that provide critical services - such as education, healthcare, and public administration - continue to exhibit significant accessibility and usability barriers. This study evaluates the accessibility of Bangladeshi government and non-government websites under WCAG~2.2 by combining automated accessibility assessments with user-reported feedback. A total of 212 websites were analyzed using multiple automated tools, complemented by a survey of 103 users to capture real-world usability, accessibility, and security experiences. The results reveal substantial disparities between government and non-government websites, highlighting persistent issues related to navigation complexity, interaction cost, visual readability, accessibility feature adoption, and authentication mechanisms. While non-government websites generally demonstrate better usability and functional performance, accessibility support remains inconsistent across both categories. The findings underscore the need for regular accessibility audits, user-centered design practices, and policy-driven interventions to improve digital inclusivity and ensure equitable access to online services for diverse user populations.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.00579v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The fast integration of artificial intelligence into mobile applications has completely changed the digital landscape; however, the impact of this change on user perception of AI features remains poorly understood. This large-scale analysis examined 1,484,633 mobile application reviews across 422 applications (200 AI-featuring, 222 control) from iOS App Store and Google Play Store. By employing sentiment classification, topic modeling, and concern-benefit categorization, we identified a major disconnect: only 11.9% of reviews mentioned AI, even though 47.4% of applications featured AI capabilities. AI-featuring applications received significantly lower ratings than traditional applications (d = 0.40); however, hierarchical regression revealed a hidden pattern - the negative relationship reversed after controlling for AI mentions and review characteristics (b = 0.405, p < .001). Privacy dominated user concerns (34.8% of concern-expressing reviews), while efficiency represented the primary benefit (42.3%). Effects varied greatly by category, from positive for Assistant applications (d = 0.55) to negative for Entertainment (d = -0.23). These findings suggest that AI features often operate below user awareness thresholds, and it is the explicit recognition of AI, rather than its mere presence, that drives negative evaluations. This challenges basic assumptions about technology acceptance in AI systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.00570v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Cognitive reappraisal is a well-studied emotion regulation strategy that helps individuals reinterpret stressful situations to reduce their impact. Many digital mental health tools struggle to support this process because rigid scripts fail to accommodate how users naturally describe stressors. This study examined the feasibility of an LLM-based single-session intervention (SSI) for workplace stress reappraisal. We assessed short-term changes in stress-related outcomes and examined design tensions during use. We conducted a feasibility study with 100 employees at a large technology company who completed a structured cognitive reappraisal session delivered by a GPT-4o-based chatbot. Pre-post measures included perceived stress intensity, stress mindset, perceived demand, and perceived resources. These outcomes were analyzed using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with correction for multiple comparisons. We also examined sentiment and stress trajectories across conversation quartiles using two RoBERTa-based classifiers and an LLM-based stress rater. Open-ended responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results showed significant reductions in perceived stress intensity and significant improvements in stress mindset. Changes in perceived resources and perceived demand trended in expected directions but were not statistically significant. Automated analyses indicated consistent declines in negative sentiment and stress over the course of the interaction. Qualitative findings suggested that participants valued the structured prompts for organizing thoughts, gaining perspective, and feeling acknowledged. Participants also reported tensions around scriptedness, preferred interaction length, and reactions to AI-driven empathy. These findings highlight both the promise and the design constraints of integrating LLMs into DMH interventions for workplace settings.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.00382v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI-driven speech-to-text (STT) documentation systems are increasingly adopted in clinical settings to reduce documentation burden and improve workflow efficiency. However, their rapid deployment has outpaced understanding of the associated socio-technical risks, including transparency, reliability, patient autonomy, workflow alignment, and organizational governance. A clearer analysis of these risks is needed to support safe and equitable integration into healthcare practice. This study synthesizes interdisciplinary evidence from technical performance research, regulatory and ethical standards, clinical workflow analyses, and organizational policy guidance. The synthesis was used to develop a multi-layered socio-technical conceptual framework for evaluating and governing STT systems. Findings show that STT systems operate within tightly coupled socio-technical environments in which model performance, clinician oversight, patient rights, workflow design, and institutional governance are interdependent. The study offers a structured socio-technical governance framework and an implementation roadmap that outlines readiness assessment, vendor evaluation, pilot deployment, clinician training, ongoing monitoring, and iterative improvement. The framework emphasizes safeguards that protect patient autonomy, documentation integrity, and institutional trust while enabling the efficient and beneficial use of STT technologies. This work provides actionable guidance for healthcare organizations seeking to adopt STT systems responsibly and equitably.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.00333v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: During musical collaboration, visual cues are essential for communication between musicians. Extended Reality (XR) applications, often used with head-mounted displays like Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, can limit the field of view (FOV) of players. We conducted a study to investigate the effects of limited FOV on co-presence, gesture recognition, overall enjoyment, and reaction time.\n  Initially, we observed experienced musicians collaborating informally with and without visual occlusion, noting that collaboration suffered with limited FOV. We then conducted a within-subjects study with 19 participants, comparing an unrestricted FOV holographic setup called HoloJam to Nreal AR glasses with a 52$^{\\circ}$ limited FOV. In the AR setup, we tested two conditions: standard AR with a 52$^{\\circ}$ FOV and a modified AR notification system called Mini Musicians.\n  Results showed that HoloJam provided higher co-presence, quicker gesture recognition, and greater enjoyment. The Mini Musicians application reduced reaction time and maintained enjoyment compared to the standard AR setup. We conclude that limited FOV impacts musical collaboration, but notifications can improve reaction time and should be considered in future XR music collaborations.",

Furthermore, effective remote collaboration remains a significant challenge, with existing solutions hampered by network latency and asynchronous file sharing. This paper investigates the potential of Mixed Reality (MR) to overcome these barriers, creating an intuitive environment for real-time, remote musical collaboration. We employ qualitative and speculative design techniques to better understand: 1) how players currently use DAWs, and 2) to imagine a speculative future of collaborative MR-DAWs. To facilitate this discussion, we developed and evaluated the usability of a design probe, MR-DAW. An MR system enabling multiple, geographically dispersed users to control a single, shared DAW instance while moving freely in their local spaces. Our networked system enables each remote musician to use a physical foot pedal for collaborative looping, merging a familiar, hands-free interaction with a shared virtual session. Based on interviews and system evaluations with 20 musicians, we analyze current practices, report on the user experience with our MR system, and speculate on the future of musical collaboration in MR. Our results highlight the affordances of MR for unencumbered musical interaction and provide a speculative outlook on the future of remote collaborative DAWs in the Musical Metaverse.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.00001v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Hospitals are among the most cognitively demanding indoor environments, especially for patients and visitors unfamiliar with their layout. This study investigates the effectiveness of an augmented reality (AR)-based handheld navigation system compared to traditional paper maps in a large hospital setting. Through a mixed-methods experiment with 32 participants, we measured navigation performance, cognitive workload (NASA-TLX), situational anxiety (STAI-State), spatial behavior, and user satisfaction. Results show that AR users completed navigation tasks significantly faster, made fewer errors, and reported lower anxiety and workload. However, paper map users demonstrated stronger spatial memory in sketch-based recall tasks, highlighting a trade-off between real-time efficiency and long-term spatial learning. We discuss implications for inclusive AR design, spatial cognition, and healthcare accessibility, offering actionable design strategies for adaptive indoor navigation tools.",

    "content": "arXiv:2501.04706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Elevated kurtosis values have been observed in subcortical grey matter structures of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Here we tested whether these elevated values are related to iron content, which generate magnetic fields that add to the diffusion encoding gradients. Multi-shell diffusion and multi-echo gradient echo acquisitions were used to derive mean kurtosis and iron measures (R2* and magnetic susceptibility), respectively, in subcortical grey matter nuclei and white matter tracts in a discovery cohort (110 older and 63 younger adults) and replication cohort (72 healthy older adults). Iron-rich grey matter regions exhibited higher mean kurtosis, R2*, and magnetic susceptibility and white matter regions had lower mean kurtosis in the older adult group. In both cohorts, mean kurtosis was significantly correlated with R2* and magnetic susceptibility in iron-rich grey matter nuclei. No association was seen between signal-to-noise ratio and mean kurtosis in any grey matter region, indicating that the increase in mean kurtosis was not due to reduced signal-to-noise. Finally, a phantom experiment found higher mean kurtosis as iron concentrations increased. Our findings indicate that kurtosis is associated with iron-sensitive metrics in iron-rich grey matter structures, suggesting that kurtosis may be sensitive to iron deposits.",

    "title": "Deep Teleportation: Quantum Simulation of Conscious Report in Attentional Blink",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.18585v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recent quantum models of cognition have successfully simulated several interesting effects in human experimental data, from vision to reasoning and recently even consciousness. The latter case, consciousness has been a quite challenging phenomenon to model, and most efforts have been through abstract mathematical quantum methods, mainly focused on conceptual issues. Classical (non-quantum) models of consciousness-related experiments exist, but they generally fail to align well with human data. We developed a straightforward quantum model to simulate conscious reporting of seeing or missing competing stimuli within the famous attentional blink paradigm. In an attentional blink task, a target stimulus (T2) that appears after a previous one (T1) can be consciously reported if the delay between presenting them is short enough (called lag 1), otherwise it can be rendered invisible during the so-called refractory period of attention (lags 2 to 6 and even longer). For modeling this phenomenon, we employed a three-qubit entanglement ansatz circuit in the form of a deep teleportation channel instead of the well-known EPR channel. While reporting the competing stimuli was supposed to be the classical measurement outcomes, the effect of distractor stimuli (i.e., masks, if any) was encoded simply as random angle rotations. The simulation outcome for different states was measured, and the classical outcome probabilities were further used as inputs to a simple linear neural network. The result revealed a non-linear, alternating state pattern that closely mirrors human responses in conscious stimuli reporting. The main result was a successful simulation of Lag 1 sparing, lag 7 divergence, and masking effect through probabilistic outcome of measurement in different conditions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.23321v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Linearly transforming stimulus representations of deep neural networks yields high-performing models of behavioral and neural responses to complex stimuli. But does the test accuracy of such predictions identify genuine representational alignment? We addressed this question through a large-scale model-recovery study. Twenty diverse vision models were linearly aligned to 4.5 million behavioral judgments from the THINGS odd-one-out dataset and calibrated to reproduce human response variability. For each model in turn, we sampled synthetic responses from its probabilistic predictions, fitted all candidate models to the synthetic data, and tested whether the data-generating model would re-emerge as the best predictor of the simulated data. Model recovery accuracy improved with training-set size but plateaued below 80%, even at millions of simulated trials. Regression analyses linked misidentification primarily to shifts in representational geometry induced by the linear transformation, as well as to the effective dimensionality of the transformed features. These findings demonstrate that, even with massive behavioral data, overly flexible alignment metrics may fail to guide us toward artificial representations that are genuinely more human-aligned. Model comparison experiments must be designed to balance the trade-off between predictive accuracy and identifiability-ensuring that the best-fitting model is also the right one.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.00466v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many of the most consequential dynamics in human cognition occur \\emph{before} events become explicit: before decisions are finalized, emotions are labeled, or meanings stabilize into narrative form. These pre-event states are characterized by ambiguity, contextual tension, and competing latent interpretations. Rogue Variable Theory (RVT) formalizes such states as \\emph{Rogue Variables}: structured, pre-event cognitive configurations that influence outcomes while remaining unresolved or incompatible with a system's current representational manifold. We present a quantum-consistent information-theoretic implementation of RVT based on a time-indexed \\emph{Mirrored Personal Graph} (MPG) embedded into a fixed graph Hilbert space, a normalized \\emph{Quantum MPG State} (QMS) constructed from node and edge metrics under context, Hamiltonian dynamics derived from graph couplings, and an error-weighted `rogue operator'' whose principal eigenvectors identify rogue factor directions and candidate Rogue Variable segments. We further introduce a \\emph{Rosetta Stone Layer} (RSL) that maps user-specific latent factor coordinates into a shared reference Hilbert space to enable cross-user comparison and aggregation without explicit node alignment. The framework is fully implementable on classical systems and does not assume physical quantum processes; \\emph{collapse} is interpreted as informational decoherence under interaction, often human clarification.",

    "content": "Motor imagery (MI) is a sensorimotor process allowing to mentally simulate a motor action and is widely used to enhance performance in domains such as rehabilitation, sport, and professional training. Although MI is increasingly incorporated into stress-management interventions, the reciprocal relationship, that is, the effect of acute stress on MI remain paradoxically poorly understood, particularly in ecologically valid settings. The present study investigated this issue in professional police officers performing physically and mentally a precise handgun manipulation task under graded stress conditions (psychological stress). Fourteen participants was exposed to controlled, work-related stress scenarios designed to closely reflect real operational demands, while stress markers and temporal features of executed and imagined movements were recorded. Our results clearly indicate that motor imagery was preserved despite significant increases in stress levels, as the temporal characteristics of both executed and imagined movements remained stable across experimental conditions.

    "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
    "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
    "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

    "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
    "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

    "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
    "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

    "content": "This Perspective article discusses the emerging potential of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) as a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique for enhancing self-regulatory processes, particularly emotion and sleep regulation, in healthy individuals. Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population. Our aim is to highlight the potential of TUS-based integrated interventions for supporting mental health and well-being in non-clinical populations and to outline key directions for future research.",

    "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
    "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Gentleness, defined as the ability to handle tissues delicately and minimize unnecessary force, is a key indicator of surgical proficiency. Objective and real-time assessment of gentleness in virtual reality (VR)-based training can enhance the understanding of both psychomotor and cognitive aspects of surgical skill. This study evaluates and classifies participants gentleness during VR-based surgical simulations using fNIRS-derived hemodynamic features. We trained and compared several machine learning models to assess performance. Twenty-three volunteers with no prior laparoscopic experience performed a virtual reality-based laparoscopic double-grasper task while hemodynamic activity over frontal and motor cortical areas was recorded using eighteen fNIRS channels. Alongside fNIRS, we collected subjective workload (NASA-TLX), error numbers, and a VR gentleness score. This task involves using two grasper tools simultaneously to perform the tissue like balloon manipulation in a VR environment. We extracted temporal features (slope, RMS, standard deviation) and trained machine learning models to classify performance levels based on cortical activation. Labels were binarized as low vs. high using median splits for the gentleness score. Models were evaluated with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and summarized by accuracy. Results showed stronger right-frontal HbO activity and increased left-motor HbR responses in the low-performance group, suggesting greater cognitive effort and less efficient motor strategies during VR-based laparoscopic manipulation. Across classifiers and feature sets, slope-based features consistently outperformed variability- and amplitude-based metrics. Among the tested models, HbR slope features achieved the best overall classification performance, with the highest accuracy obtained using K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest classifiers (accuracy {approx} 0.89, AUC up to 0.97). These findings demonstrate that fNIRS-derived hemodynamic dynamics can reliably discriminate between high and low VR performance levels, supporting their potential use in automated performance assessment and neuroadaptive feedback frameworks for VR-based surgical training.",

    "title": "When exploration replaces storage: how eye movements shape visual working memory",
    "content": "Visual working memory (VWM) is traditionally studied while constraining eye movements and limiting access to visual input, yet in natural vision humans constantly explore and resample their environment. Only a few studies have examined VWM utilization when participants were allowed to interact with the environment and found that participants often preferred to resample their environment rather than rely on VWM storage. However, since eye movements were not controlled in these studies, the link between VWM utilization and free visual exploration remained unknown. In two experiments (N = 40), we investigated how visual exploration shapes reliance on VWM versus perceptual input. Participants searched for a common target across two item sets and could either store multiple items for comparison or repeatedly resample the sets by switching between them. Results revealed that when switching was achieved through eye movements, participants consistently relied more on visual resampling and less on VWM; in contrast, when switching required a manual response, they shifted toward greater VWM use. This pattern persisted even when peripheral input was equated, suggesting that natural exploration through eye movements reduces the cognitive cost of acquiring visual information, leading to a strategic reduction in VWM use. Our findings challenge fixation-based approaches to VWM research and highlight the importance of studying cognition under ecological viewing conditions.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe assessment of gender perception influenced by ambiguous facial cues in patients requiring emergency medical attention remains ambiguous. Pareidolia faces represent unconscious errors in facial recognition, wherein a wide array of visual attributes contribute to the interpretation of facial features. This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying gender perception in individuals undergoing emergency medical treatment, employing an innovative digital pareidolia assessment to evaluate gender perception within the context of face pareidolia.MethodsFifty adult patients treated by a female physician in the green triage zone participated in the study. Target images consisted of face pareidolia images, while non-target images were scrambled. All images were standardized for size, tone, and light intensity. Patients instructed the pareidolia images and were asked if they discerned a face; if they answered \u2018No,\u2019 the next image was shown. If they saw a face, they identified the associated gender. Their responses and reaction times were systematically recorded digitally.ResultsOur findings revealed that, regardless of wait times, patients were significantly more likely to identify pareidolia faces as male rather than female, especially after being examined by a female physician. Additionally, male patients exhibited slightly longer reaction times than females when responding to pareidolia images.ConclusionThe outcomes of this investigation provide critical insights into the influence of pareidolia on gender perception of faces in the emergency department setting. It underscores the notion that gender biases, which arise from both biological and sociocultural factors, can affect the dynamics of patient-physician interactions.",

    "title": "A method for measuring first glymphatic influx of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer in the human brain",
    "content": "IntroductionThe glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular transport route for fluids and solutes in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serves as a conduit for solute transport and clearance of brain waste. Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the intrathecal contrast agent serves as a CSF tracer, has been developed to measure glymphatic function in humans. The normalized MRI T1 signal is a semiquantitative measure of CSF flow and exchange with the brain. Objective: To estimate first-time tracer appearance within brain tissue after intrathecal tracer injection.MethodsThis study implemented segmented regression analysis to estimate the first-time tracer appearance of an intrathecal tracer within brain tissues. An increase (breakpoint) in the normalized MRI T1 signal was defined to represent first glymphatic influx of the tracer. The study included 30 reference (REF) subjects with no identified CSF disturbance and 15 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We developed and evaluated the method in REF subjects and further compared it between the two study groups.ResultsThe time to initial glymphatic tracer enrichment in the REF cohort was approximately 1\u202fh in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cerebral cortex and ranged from two to 4\u202fh in the corresponding white matter regions. In subcortical limbic structures and basal ganglia structures, it was 0.6 and 2.2\u202fh, respectively. Compared with REF subjects, IIH patients presented a non-significant mean difference in the first appearance of \u00b10.5\u202fh in the cerebral cortex and white matter regions, with somewhat longer estimated delays in the parietal and insular white matter regions. The results are presented as time series plots and estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we provide supplementary R code, which can be adapted for use in future studies, and outline a basic assessment of true versus estimated breakpoints using simulated data.ConclusionSegmented regression was found feasible to quantify the time to first glymphatic enrichment, i.e., increase in the normalized MRI T1 signal. Moreover, the method seems reasonable to differentiate first glymphatic influx between the cohorts.",

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

The key points they laid out were:</p> <ol> <li>Backend frameworks like FastAPI are really mature and have great developer experience</li> <li>Types are first class, and this makes it easy to write and debug backend code</li> <li>The level of abstraction FastAPI provides is <em>just right</em></li> </ol> <p>However, I came to a different conclusion on how client side code could be improved.</p> <p>I believe that the biggest point of friction when writing client side code that interfaces with backend HTTP APIs is the HTTP boundary between frontend and backend. <strong>All the well written function signatures, types and docstrings on the backend is lost</strong> when writing the frontend code, to be recreated painstakingly through reading through the OpenAPI/Swagger docs.</p> <p>OpenAPI docs are an <strong>out-of-band information source</strong> that the frontend must be kept in sync with and there is no information on when it is updated, what changed and no error checking or type validation supports you as you write the frontend code.</p> <p>I believe that the solution is maintaining the function signature of the backend code on the frontend, including arguments, their types, whether they are optional, etc.</p> <pre><code>from server import get_item from http_clientlib import set_default_configuration, wrap_backend_call from http_clientlib.http import make_http_request set_default_configuration( base_url=&quot;http://production.backend.com&quot;, http_request_function=make_http_request ) # Wrap the backend function and invoke it to make a HTTP request get_item_http = wrap_backend_call(get_item) response = get_item_http(item_id=42, page=2) print(response) # Response is a HTTPResponse you can handle if response.ok(): ... </code></pre> <p>A screenshot showing how the type information looks like is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/zhuweiji/http_clientlib/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#why\">https://github.com/zhuweiji/http_clientlib/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#why</a></p> <p>This RPC-style approach allows you to treat the function call as a networking call separate from a normal function, handle the response however you like, only with better type information for the backend endpoints in your editor.</p> <p>Some caveats are:</p> <ol> <li>Python-only \u2014 Works for a frontend/backend stack built in python, and quite a bit of client-side code is written for the browser</li> <li>Server code must be imported \u2014 Client needs access to server function definitions</li> </ol> <p>I whipped this up pretty quickly and it's not fully featured yet, but I wanted to stir some discussion on whether something like this would be useful, and if the RPC approach would make sense in python - something similar already exists on the JS world as <a href=\"https://trpc.io/\">tRPC</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/zhuweiji/http_clientlib\">github</a>, <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/http_clientlib/\">pypi (http_clientlib)</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/19andNuttin\"> /u/19andNuttin </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3xahl/making_a_better_clientside_experience_for_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3xahl/making_a_better_clientside_experience_for_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

IT doesn't mess with your homebrew installs. it is descriptive and transparent on every step so you know what is exactly happening. I didn't know how much work that would be before I got into it, But it finally came together :') I wanted to make sure User experience was better when you use it rather than the janky UI that only I understood. It installs Pillow and other relevant dependencies automatically.</p> <p>It takes the smallest edge for the size, so if you put in 450px (default is 800), whatever image you give it, it will take it and check for smallest edge and make it 450px, and adjusts the other edge proportionally. (Basic options to crop too, default is no, ofcourse).</p> <p>I had previously created a thread sharing the same when this project was in infancy (v2.0) about 5 months ago. A lot has changed since and alot more is polished. I cleaned the code and made it multithreaded. I humanly cannot write all the features down below because my ADHD doesn't allow me, so please feel free to just visit the Github page and details are right there. I have added Fastrack Profiles so you can save your selections and just fly through your images. There's something called watchdog that does what it says. A watchdog is something that points to directory you have chosen to paste photos and optimize them when pasted automatically to said config. you stop it and it stops.</p> <p>Multiple image formats and Quality options (upscaling as well) made it fast for me to work with projects. Such that I don't use plugins anymore to compress images on my server as doing on my system is just plain faster and less painful. Personal choice obviously, Your workflow might differ. Anyways.</p> <p>Thanks for your time reading this.<br /> Happy New Year everyone! I hope you all land great clients and projects this year.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/raghav4882\"> /u/raghav4882 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3dm9t/github_raghav4882terminallyquick_v40_fast/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3dm9t/github_raghav4882terminallyquick_v40_fast/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "content": "To address the mismatch between current ankle rehabilitation robots and natural human motion, which affects rehabilitation efficacy, this paper uses screw theory and motion capture experiments to identify the instantaneous finite helical motion axis (IFHA) of the human ankle joint. It determines the distribution law of the IFHA and twist pitch (TP) of the ankle, and designs a human-machine motion compatible rope-driven ankle joint rehabilitation robot that meets the needs of human ankle joint rehabilitation. Firstly, human ankle motion trajectories are captured using the VICON system and IMU, and the experimental data are processed according to screw theory to obtain the distribution law of the IFHA and the range of TP. Secondly, the ankle joint's motion characteristics from the experiment inform the constraint characteristics of the rehabilitation mechanism, which are then mapped into a novel parallel rope-driven ankle rehabilitation robot to meet rehabilitation needs. Thirdly, the kinematic model of the novel mechanism is established, and its kinematic performance and singular configurations are analyzed based on the motion/force transmission index, guiding the optimization of the driving rope layout and mechanism scale parameters. Finally, an experimental platform is built to validate the human-machine motion compatibility, safety, comfort, and effectiveness of the rehabilitation robot.",

    "title": "GONet: A Generalizable Deep Learning Model for Glaucoma Detection",
    "content": "Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON), affecting an estimated 64.3 million people globally, causes irreversible vision loss when not detected early. Traditional diagnosis requires time-consuming ophthalmic examinations by specialists. Recent deep learning models for automating GON detection from colour fundus photographs (CFP) have shown promise but often suffer from limited generalizability across different ethnicities, disease groups and examination settings. To address these limitations, we introduce GONet, a robust deep learning model developed using seven independent datasets, including over 119\u2009000 CFPs with gold-standard annotations and from patients of diverse geographic backgrounds. GONet consists of a DINOv2 pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer fine-tuned using a multisource domain strategy. GONet demonstrated high out-of-distribution generalizability, with an AUC of 0.88-0.99 in target domains. GONet performance was similar or superior to state-of-the-art works and the cup-to-disc ratio, by up to 18.4%. GONet is available via Lirot.ai (www.aimlab-technion.com/lirot-ai). We also contribute a new dataset consisting of 747 CFPs with GON labels as open access, available at https://doi.org/10.13026/pdxv-m215.",

    "title": "Phase Correction of MR Spectroscopic Imaging Data Using Model-Based Signal Estimation and Extrapolation",
    "content": "Objective: To develop an effective method for phase correction of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. Methods: In many MRSI applications, it is desirable to generate absorption-mode spectra, which requires correction of phase errors in the measured MRSI data. Conventional phase correction methods are sensitive to measurement noise and baseline distortion, often resulting in distorted absorption-mode spectra from MRSI data with low-SNR and long acquisition dead time. This paper proposed a novel model-based method for improved phase correction of MRSI data. The proposed method determined the zeroth-order phase and acquisition dead time using a Lorentzian-based spectral model and performed signal extrapolation using a generalized series model. Absorption-mode spectra were then generated from the phase-corrected and extrapolated MRSI data. Results: The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated data and experimental data acquired from human subjects in multi-nuclei (31P, 2H, and 1H) MRSI experiments. Simulation results demonstrated improved parameter estimation accuracy by the proposed method under various noise levels and dead times. The proposed method also consistently generated high-quality absorption-mode spectra with minimal spectral distortions from experimental data. The proposed method was compared with state-of-the-art methods (including the entropy method and LCModel method) and showed more robust phase correction performance with less spectral distortions. Conclusion: This paper introduced a novel method for phase correction of MRSI data. Results from simulated and in vivo data demonstrated that high-quality absorption-mode spectra could be obtained using the proposed method. Significance: This method will provide a useful tool for processing MRSI data.",

    "title": "A cell-type-resolved human brain atlas of microRNAs and tRNA fragments",
    "content": "MicroRNAs (miRs) and transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) regulate multiple brain processes ranging from neurogenesis and development through diverse neurological disorders. However, the cell-type specificity of brain miRs and tRFs remains poorly characterized, limiting the interpretation of their function. To address this issue, we generated a comprehensive, cell-type-resolved atlas of miRs and tRFs from live human brain tissues. Specifically, we isolated neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes from neurosurgery-obtained fresh human brain samples and profiled their miR and tRF repertoires using small RNA-sequencing. Our atlas revealed multiple differences in miR and tRF expression between the four cell types and consequently identified novel cell-type markers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR cell-type specificity may be regulated by quantitative trait loci located in cell-type-associated enhancer regions. We also report higher levels of 5'-tRNA halves in neurons compared to glia, including a particular neuronal enrichment of 5'-tRNA halves derived from glycine, leucine and lysine tRNAs. These neuronal tRFs were significantly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease postmortem brain samples compared to age-matched controls, possibly reflecting a neuronal response to disease. Our atlas, together with an accompanying statistical tool for miR cell-type enrichment analysis, provides a publicly available resource for delineating small RNA cell-type origin and function in the human brain.",

    "title": "Understanding Brain Aging Through Behavioural and Microglial Changes: A Lifespan Approach",
    "content": "Aging is characterized by progressive physiological decline linked to inflammaging, a chronic low-grade inflammatory state. This study investigates age-related behavioural changes and their correlation with microglial function in female Sprague Dawley rats across their lifespan. Using a longitudinal design at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months of age, we assessed motor performance, mood-related behaviours, and spatial cognition alongside microglial morphometric analysis in key brain regions. Results showed that motor and cognitive performance began to decline significantly at 12 months, with severe impairments and depressive-like behaviours appearing by 24 months. These deficits were paralleled by progressive gliosis in the hippocampus and striatum. Microglial morphometric analysis further indicated a more reactive, region-dependent phenotype, with cells in the striatum adopting a smaller area, reduced perimeter, and fewer intersections. These findings provide compelling evidence for significant age-dependent deterioration in motor performance, mood regulation, and cognitive abilities in female rats. Our data strongly suggest an underlying progression of neurobiological changes, with microglial dysfunction and neuroinflammation being central candidates. This research contributes valuable insights into the cellular correlates of behavioural decline across the female lifespan, serving as a reference for the multifaceted changes that occur during normal aging.",

    "content": "Neural circuits in the brain control high-level parameters of movement, including the initiation, speed, and direction of locomotion. How specific cell types are organized into circuits to compute these control signals and enable context-appropriate behavior remains unclear. Here, we identify central brain neurons in Drosophila that can initiate walking and exert graded control over walking speed. Connectome analyses position the neurons on top of a layered brain circuit, which recruits a specific population of descending neurons to control forward walking independently of turning and other parameters. As predicted by the connectome, the circuit enforces straight walking when activated unilaterally, and the activity of the central brain neurons represents a high-level walking drive. This drive is suppressed during flight but flexibly integrated with other control signals to enable complex movement sequences during obstacle negotiation. Together, our findings elucidate a dedicated brain circuit that enables efficient computation, selection, and integration of forward-walking signals for context-appropriate motor control.",

    "title": "Dopaminergic Modulation of Mushroom Body Output Neurons Mediates Nociception-Induced Escape in Drosophila",
    "content": "In Drosophila, noxious heat is detected by peripheral nociceptors expressing transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, including Painless and TrpA1, and rapidly triggers escape behavior. Although peripheral transduction has been defined in detail, the central circuits and neuromodulatory mechanisms that translate nociceptor activity into escape decisions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine targeted behavioral perturbations with anatomical tracing to delineate a nociception to escape pathway that engages dopaminergic modulation of mushroom body (MB) output. Kir2.1 mediated silencing across candidate neurotransmitter systems revealed a specific requirement for MB innervating dopaminergic neurons (DANs), particularly subsets within the PPL1 and PAM clusters, for robust nociception induced escape. Anterograde trans Tango tracing from painless and trpA1 expressing nociceptors labeled these MB dopaminergic neurons as direct postsynaptic partners, consistent with convergence of distinct nociceptor inputs onto a shared dopaminergic pathway. Finally, silencing a subset of mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) delayed escape without overtly disrupting baseline locomotion, supporting a model in which dopaminergic signaling recruits MB output to shape defensive action selection. Together, our results define a multi layer circuit motif linking peripheral nociception to MB dependent escape and provide a framework for dissecting how neuromodulation gates rapid defensive behaviors.",

    "content": "Objective: To design and fabricate a band-pass birdcage volume resonator and eight channel, conformal receive array coil for MRI of both awake and anesthetized marmoset brain at 7T. The coil is compatible with a whole body 7T clinical MRI scanner running in single channel transmit (sTx) mode. Methods: The marmoset head coil included a shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil with 24 legs, as well as 8 overlapped receive elements. Electromagnetic (EM) field simulation was performed for the 24 leg band pass birdcage Tx coil to calculate the B1+ efficiency. The efficacy of both transmit and receive coil designs were evaluated by measuring standard coil performance metrics. This was done while imaging a marmoset head phantom, as well as by acquiring in vivo, anesthetized and awake marmoset images. Results: The transmit coil along with the optimized receive array produced high resolution (0.8 mm isotropic for EPI images; 0.36 mm isotropic for structural images) and high SNR (between 50 and 80) images of the marmoset brain. The simulated B1+ efficiency of the birdcage at the center of the phantom was 2.6 \u00b5T/sqrt (W). Conclusion and significance: A shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil was designed and fabricated for marmoset brain imaging at 7T. An 8-channel receive array consisting of eight overlapped loops, covering the whole brain of the marmoset, was also constructed and applied for signal reception. The system successfully allowed scanning of both young and older marmosets. It is well-suited for longitudinal studies of marmoset brain structure. The coil advantageously allows the study of neurodevelopment and primate brain function.",

    "content": "Objective: To develop a transceiver radio frequency (RF) coil optimized for high resolution small-animal imaging at 14.1 T, aimed at enhancing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. Methods: A hybrid distributed capacitance (HDC) birdcage coil was designed, combining conventional endring lumped capacitors with distributed capacitance along the legs, implemented using double-layer copper-clad substrates. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations were employed to optimize the coil's structural parameters and capacitance values for maximum RF performance. The HDC birdcage coil's performance was evaluated against a conventional bandpass (BP) design through electromagnetic simulations, bench tests, and phantom imaging. In vivo validation was performed using mouse imaging. Results: EM simulations demonstrated that the HDC design enhances mean $\\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ and $\\text{B}_{1}^{-}$ field strengths by 11.8% and 11.7%, respectively, relative to the conventional BP design. The HDC design also showed reduced electric field (E-field) value in phantom, with 4.2% lower mean and 11.4% lower maximum E-field value. Bench measurements revealed a superior quality factor (Q factor) for the HDC coil, with a 34.2% higher unloaded Q value compared to the conventional design. Phantom imaging confirmed a 41% SNR improvement with the HDC design. The optimized HDC coil enabled mouse brain imaging at 50 $ \\!\\!\\mu \\!\\!\\text{ m}$ resolution.Conclusion: The proposed HDC birdcage coil demonstrated superior receiver sensitivity and Q factor compared to conventional designs, yielding significant SNR improvements in 14.1 T imaging. Significance: The results demonstrated the feasibility of achieving enhanced coil performance through HDC design at ultra-high field strength, providing a promising approach for improving image quality in small-animal MRI applications.",

    "title": "Neural markers of visual working memory during an upper extremity movement-coupled task: a mobile brain-body imaging (MOBI) study.",
    "content": "Optimal goal directed behavior in everyday life involves the appropriate coupling of cognition and movement. In this study we employed a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) system that integrated time-synchronized high-density electroencephalography with three-dimensional motion capture during a touchscreen visual working memory task requiring dynamic upper extremity reach responses. Using this framework we examined how increasing memory load (e.g. from 1-disc to 4-discs) influences behavior and scalp-recorded neural activity when cognitive and motor processes are coupled within a single task, and whether these effects are modulated by handedness. Increasing memory load reliably degraded working memory task performance and slowed motor preparation while core movement execution measures remained largely preserved. Regarding electroencephalography data, parieto-occipital activity increased with load during both the early visual-evoked N1 and the delay period However, load-related modulation reached a plateau at the 3-disc condition during the delay period only. Posterior-frontal engagement also strengthened as load increased, consistent with demands on attentional control memory maintenance and sensorimotor planning. Brain-behavior associations were most robust at a moderate 2-disc level where contralateral delay activity correlated with both cognitive and motor performance measures. Finally, although handedness exerted selective behavioral effects it did not modulate load-related parieto-occipital neural activity Together these findings demonstrate that a multimodal MoBI approach captures integrated cognitive-motor dynamics during working memory guided actions, providing a more comprehensive characterization of behavior and underlying neural signatures than either modality alone This framework offers a translational approach for studying cognitive-motor interactions and their potential disruption in neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.",

    "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

    "title": "Oscillatory Correlates of Metacontrol: Beta and Theta Band Contributions to Feedback-dependent Cognitive Adaptation",
    "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

    "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
    "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

    "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
    "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

    "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
    "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

    "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

    "title": "Neural Evidence for Tonal Prediction: Multivariate Decoding of Predicted Tone Categories Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data",
    "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

    "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
    "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

    "title": "The Interactive Effects of Negative Emotion and Reward Motivation on Visual Perception",
    "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

    "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

    "title": "Catestatin ameliorates tauopathy and amyloidogenesis via adrenergic inhibition",
    "content": "Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers disease, Corticobasal Degeneration, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy are characterized by Tau aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation and progressive cognitive decline. Although metabolic dysregulation and neuropeptide imbalance have been linked to these disorders, the functional consequences of such imbalance and its potential for therapeutic reversal remain poorly understood. Our previous work identified chromogranin A, which encodes a pro-hormone for several metabolic peptides, as a key regulator of Tau pathology. Here, we investigate Catestatin, a chromogranin A derived peptide that is a potent inhibitor of catecholamine release and has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and lower peripheral blood pressure. We report significant reductions in CST levels in the hippocampus and cortex of AD brains, as well as in the frontal cortex of CBD and the basal ganglia of PSP. Supplementing CST in cortical neuronal cultures and organotypic slice cultures decreased Tau phosphorylation and aggregation. In vivo, CST administration in PS19 Tauopathy mice reduced pathological Tau species, attenuated gliosis, and improved cognitive function. CST treatment also lowered amyloid plaque burden and neuroinflammation in 5XFAD mice. Mechanistically, CST decreased epinephrine levels in both PS19 and 5XFAD mice and suppressed downstream protein kinase A hyperactivation in PS19 and OTSC. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized neuropeptidergic mechanism linking CST deficiency to elevated adrenergic receptor, epinephrine and PKA stress signaling and Tauopathy driven neurodegeneration, suggesting CST replacement as a promising therapeutic approach.",

    "title": "Single-cell map of the female brain across reproductive transitions",
    "content": "Ovarian hormone shifts enable reproduction and are associated with substantial brain plasticity and disease risks. While imaging studies provide (micro)structural insights into brain changes across the ovarian cycle and pregnancy, the high resolution, single-cell map of the brain across reproductive transitions is missing. Here, we performed multiome (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) analysis of the mouse ventral hippocampus (vHIP) across sex, estrous cycle, and peripartum period at single cell resolution. We identify dynamic changes in vHIP cellular composition across the estrous cycle and pregnancy, including in the neural stem cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), enabling hormone-driven neurogenesis. Major gene expression changes are neuronal function-relevant, cell type-specific, and found in excitatory neurons of CA1, CA3, and DG subfields, across sex and reproductive transitions. In contrast, chromatin accessibility changes are more extensive and found across cell types, likely driven by estrogen level shifts in both within-female and between-sex comparisons. We show that chromatin remodeling during the estrous cycle primes the genome for gene expression changes during pregnancy and is also enriched for brain disease-relevant genes. Finally, we reveal a thyroid hormone transporter (Transthyretin, Ttr) gene as the major candidate gene that drives structural and behavioral changes across the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Our study provides an extensive cellular and molecular view of how reproductive transitions shape the brain and opens the possibility to target downstream targets of estrogen, including thyroid hormone signaling, as a treatment option for hormone-sensitive periods in women.",

    "title": "Trait anxiety is associated with idiosyncratic neural event boundaries during naturalistic movie-watching",
    "content": "Anxiety is associated with altered patterns of attention to images and objects, but how it influences the perception of continuous experiences remains underexplored. Here, we examined how anxiety influences the segmentation of continuous experience into discrete events. Using a large-scale open-access dataset and data-driven methods to detect neural event boundaries, we compared neural event segmentation between healthy adults with high (N=60) and low trait-level anxiety (N=60) as they viewed a short suspenseful film. While the overall temporal event segmentation hierarchy was preserved across groups, higher-anxiety individuals had more idiosyncratic boundaries, exhibiting reduced alignment to both low-anxiety individuals and one another. This divergence was the most pronounced in the dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks, suggesting that anxiety-related disruptions in top-down attentional control may contribute to less consistent segmentation. Furthermore, boundary variability in anxious participants was higher during moments rated as more anxiety-provoking by a large language model, controlling for arousal, valence, and low-level visual features. Together, these findings suggest that idiosyncratic event models in anxious individuals result in non-normative organization of continuous experience, leading to more individualized and inconsistent event boundaries. Such variability in segmentation may have downstream consequences for prediction, memory, and social cognition, offering a potential neural mechanism by which anxiety influences the interpretation and recall of everyday experiences. Our findings highlight trait-level variability as a lens through which the brain parses information and offers a neurocomputational framework for investigating individual differences in naturalistic event cognition.",

    "title": "Neural representations of visual memory in inferotemporal cortex reveal a generalizable framework for translating between spikes and field potentials",
    "content": "Translating neurophysiological findings requires understanding the relationship between common measures of brain activity in animals (spiking activity) and humans (local field potentials, LFP). Prior work suggests alignment between population spiking and high-gamma activity (HGA, 50-150 Hz) of the LFP; however, this is not always observed and is consequently debated. Here, we show that this alignment and prior failures depend on the underlying coding scheme. First, we examined neural representations of variables related to visual memory in macaque inferotemporal cortex. We found that spikes and HGA were strikingly aligned for variables encoded as population response magnitude (novelty, recency, and memorability). However, a variable encoded as a distributed pattern of activity (category) was misaligned. Next, we showed that these insights generalize across many published studies, accounting for prior alignment successes and failures. These results provide a framework for translating between spikes and LFPs, highlighting the scenarios likely to be fruitful for translation.",

    "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of a teletherapy-based phonological short-term memory training in reducing phonological impairments in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia: a multiple case study",
    "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",

    "title": "Influence of electrode placement on the recognition of different gesture categories using high-density sEMG",
    "content": "High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)-based gesture recognition serves as a critical interface for human-computer interaction (HCI). However, recognition accuracy exhibits a significant dependency on gesture complexity and electrode positioning. To address this, we systematically investigated the relationship between gesture types and sEMG electrode placement locations through intra-subject, inter-day, and inter-subject validation protocols. Two distinct gesture categories were analyzed, i.e., single-degree-of-freedom (single-DoF) gestures and daily-used multi-finger synergistic gestures. Using an open-access gesture dataset, HD-sEMG signals were acquired from three forearm regions: the distal wrist, mid-forearm, and proximal elbow, separately. Classification results using support vector machine (SVM) revealed that single-DoF gestures achieved peak accuracy with distal wrist signals (98.63% for intra-subject, 79.73% for inter-day, and 75.47% for inter-subject validation protocols), whereas daily-used gestures performed optimally with signals from the mid-forearm and proximal elbow regions. These findings demonstrate the specific relationship between electrode placement and gesture type, providing valuable insights for EMG-HCI design and sensor placement strategies based on the nature of the target gesture.",

    "title": "Show HN: Krowdovi \u2013 Video-based indoor navigation on a DePIN creator economy",
    "content": "<p>What is this?<p>Krowdovi is an open-source platform that lets anyone with a smartphone record first-person navigation videos of indoor spaces - hospitals, airports, malls, universities - and earn tokens for helping others find their way around. It's built on Solana using a burn-and-mint DePIN model.The project addresses two problems:<p>Indoor navigation is still broken. 30% of first-time hospital visitors get lost or arrive late to appointments, costing large hospitals $200K-$500K annually in staff time. Existing solutions like Google Live View require pre-captured Street View data (which barely exists indoors), and enterprise tools charge $10K-$50K/year per venue.<p>Videographers are losing work to generative AI. Tools like Sora can generate synthetic video, but they can't walk through your hospital's actual layout or film your venue's real routes. There's an economic opportunity for creators to own location-based visual content that AI can't replicate.<p>How it works<p>For users: Scan a QR code at a venue entrance, watch a first-person video showing the route from where you are to your destination, with overlay graphics and multi-language support.<p>For creators: Record navigation videos on your phone, upload to the platform, earn reputation tiers (Bronze \u2192 Diamond) based on quality and views, get paid when users burn $FIND tokens to unlock your routes.<p>Token mechanics: Users burn $FIND tokens to mint \"credits\" that unlock videos. 75% of burned tokens are permanently removed from circulation, 25% goes to a remint pool that rewards creators. The smart contract on Solana handles burn-and-mint logic, reputation tracking, and distribution.<p>Everything is MIT licensed - fork it, the code is yours.<p>Why I built this<p>I care deeply about making the world accessible for all. If this gets forked someone executes fantastically to make the world a more accessible place for people who have visual or mobility impairments - sweet!<p>Technical stack<p>Smart Contracts: Rust/Anchor on Solana (burn-and-mint engine, reputation tiers, treasury management)\nBackend: Node.js/Express + Prisma/PostgreSQL (venue metadata, video uploads, JWT auth)<p>Frontend: Next.js 14 (Creator Studio, overlay tooling, wallet integration via @solana/wallet-adapter-react)<p>Designed to be hostable on Railway/Vercel with minimal devops. \nThe smart contract is on devnet - needs a security audit before mainnet, but you can test token burns/mints now.<p>Current limitations<p>What works: Smart contract deployed on devnet, full-stack app ready to deploy, video upload workflow, wallet authentication.<p>What doesn't: No real content yet (I need to film 10-20 venues), no mainnet token launch (waiting on security audit + demand validation), quality verification is manual, no mobile app (web-only).<p>Next steps: Deep soulful reflection on anti-gaming, moderation, ZK proofs<p>Try it yourself!<p>GitHub repo has setup instructions. You'll need Solana CLI, Node.js + pnpm, and a Solana wallet for devnet testing.Interested in forking for a different vertical, contributing code, testing by filming routes, or discussing token economics? I'm around to discuss in the comments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46484882\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46484882</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

    "title": "Dendritic excitations primarily mediate back-propagation in CA1 pyramidal neurons during behavior",
    "content": "Dendrites integrate synaptic inputs to trigger action potentials, and dendrites carry back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) to synapses where these signals contribute to plasticity. Despite strong evidence for a rich repertoire of nonlinear dendritic excitations, the in vivo roles of these excitations in dendritic integration and back-propagation remain uncertain. Here, we used high-speed voltage imaging through a chronically implanted microprism to map membrane potential dynamics from basal to apical dendrites of CA1 neurons in mice navigating in a virtual reality environment. Despite complex dendritic branch morphology, the dynamics were largely captured by 2 or 3 electrical compartments: basal, soma, and apical. Fast dendritic spikes almost always started from bAPs, indicating that dendritic spikes are primarily a consequence rather than a cause of somatic spiking. These fast spikes sometimes triggered slower apical dendritic plateau depolarizations, which drove complex spikes at the soma. We found that the biophysics of dendritic excitability determined the distribution of simple and complex spikes across a place field. Our results show how CA1 pyramidal neurons convert synaptic inputs to spiking outputs and suggest a primary role of dendritic nonlinearities in mediating activity-dependent plasticity.",

    "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "A potential field shared control approach for wheelchair navigation via brain\u2013computer interface",
    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) can help patients with disabilities control external devices directly without peripheral pathways. Due to the limitations in EEG signal quality, the performance of EEG-based BCIs may not be satisfactory. Shared control has become an important research direction in the field of brain-controlled wheelchairs (BCWs). However, most existing studies do not achieve the flexible movement of BCW in environments with narrow spaces. This study proposes a shared controller based on the potential field method to integrate environmental information and user commands intelligently. Approach. Considering the flexibility of wheelchair movement, we incorporated EEG decoding results obtained through the motor imagery paradigm and fused them with environmental information to create a fusion field. We then used these components separately to construct the BCI and obstacle fields. Twelve subjects participated in the virtual wheelchair navigation experiment, while five subjects took part in the real-world wheelchair navigation experiment, aiming to evaluate the control performance in different scenarios under three control modes (keyboard, BCI-only, and shared control). Main results. The experimental results show that the proposed shared controller: 1) significantly enhances navigation performance in both general and narrow environments compared with BCI-only control; 2) improves the total success rate from 8.33% to 83.33% in virtual complex environments and from 23.33% to 66.67% in real-world two-way navigation; 3) achieves success rates that are statistically comparable to keyboard control (p > 0.05). Moreover, the shared control reduced the average navigation time by nearly 100 s compared with BCI-only control in real-world experiments. Significance. This new shared control method improves the ability of BCWs to move flexibly in challenging, narrow environments.",

    "title": "High-level locomotion intent estimation from electromyography and body posture",
    "content": "Objective. Once we learn a reliable gait, we no longer have to consciously contract individual muscles to walk, or think about the fine-grained low-level control of our joints. Instead, we mainly make decisions on where we want to end up, at what pace and through which path. Estimating this high-level (HL) intent may provide the necessary input to wearable robotic devices to adapt to their user\u2019s needs. We introduce a continuous representation of locomotion goals and investigate how it may be estimated from muscle signals and body posture. Approach. This study investigated methods to estimate a representation of HL locomotion intent, the horizontal walking path. We collected full-body motion capture and bipolar surface electromyography data from 6 subjects during non-steady-state gait. We trained temporal convolutional networks to causally predict the walking path directly or parametrically with a critically damped trajectory model, using a mixture of muscle and body posture signals. Main results. We achieved a mean trajectory estimation accuracy for a 1-second walking path corresponding to using a multimodal model. We simultaneously provided estimates for current and desired walking velocities as constrained by the walking path model, aiding interpretability of the estimator\u2019s output. Significance. Our approach could provide user interfacing in a subject-independent format for wearable robotic devices. Moreover, this HL intent representation is flexible and able to be synthesized in virtual environments, where it can serve as a surrogate for biosignals of simulated intent-driven robotics.",
