These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for In Vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Data",
    "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

    "content": "While machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to detection and prediction tasks in clinical data, most methods rely on high-resolution data, which is not routinely available in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and perform poorly when faced with class imbalance. Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

    "content": "Relational reasoning-the capacity to understand how elements relate to one another-is a defining feature of human intelligence, yet its computational basis remains unclear. Here, we combined human neuroimaging (7T fMRI) and artificial neural network modeling to examine relational reasoning in biological and artificial systems. Using the Latin Square Task, we found that humans and transformers were able to generalise the task reliably, while standard architectures used in cognitive neuroscience could not. Analysing the transformer components revealed distinct computational roles: positional encoding captured the spatial structure of the task and aligned with representations in visual cortex, whereas attention encoded relational structure and mapped onto frontoparietal and default-mode networks. Attention weights tracked the relational complexity of the task, providing a computational analogue of working-memory demands. These results demonstrate convergent computational strategies for reasoning in brains and transformers, highlighting attention-based architectures as powerful models for investigating the neural basis of higher cognition.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "title": "Approaches for retraining sEMG classifiers for upper-limb prostheses",
    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "content": "Objective. Chronic pain affects over 20% of the adult population in the United States, posing a substantial personal as well as economic burden and contributing to the ongoing opioid crisis. Effective, non-addictive chronic pain treatments are urgently needed. Traditional drug discovery methods have failed to identify novel, non-addictive compounds, highlighting the need for alternative approaches such as phenotypic screening. Our lab developed a phenotypic screening assay using extracellular electrophysiological recordings from co-cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cell sensory neurons and glia. This study aimed to identify responsive neuronal subtypes within these presumptively heterogeneous cultures. Approach. We induced an inflammation-like state using tumor necrosis factor alpha and evaluated acute responses to nociceptor agonist capsaicin, which targets transient receptor potential vanilloid-1. By employing unsupervised learning, we labeled responsive cells based on changes in mean firing rates (MFR). We then used the labeled cells\u2019 baseline activity to train and validate five classifiers. Main results. None of the classifiers outperformed the others in regards to accuracy. Nonetheless, an RUS-boosted ensemble of decision trees achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.877 classifying nociceptors in an unseen labeled culture. Significance. The notable accuracy suggests that machine learning techniques could be employed to enhance microelectrode array-based neuronal phenotypic assays as readouts (e.g. MFR) can be weighted based on target cell type (e.g. nociceptors).",

    "content": "Objective. High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain convolutional neural networks that fail to capture cross-channel time\u2013frequency cues or on heavy transformer/generative adversarial network decoders that strain memory and stability. Approach. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time\u2013Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modeling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series. Main results. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. Significance. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

Embodiment also appears to play a crucial role, whereby stronger beliefs that one's body can complete physical tasks predict more accurate estimation of synchrony levels. However, to demonstrate the relevance of embodiment per se, direct evidence that physical embodiment (i.e., bodily knowledge of...",

    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Nightmare Distress Questionnaire (NDQ) is commonly used to assess nightmare distress. The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "title": "Nightmare disorder in women.",
    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

Whats our purpose? <em>Whats the point?</em></p>\n<p>For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth.</p>\n<p>As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress.</p>\n<p>I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings. However I believe its important that we each learn to <em><strong>harness that energy into things that are positive and kind</strong></em>, not negative or evil.</p>\n<p>Remember that a lot of who you are, is your ability to experience things outside of yourself, <em>including other humans.</em> They are a direct and immediate part of your own reality. Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved. As frustrating as the world can be, it is worth protecting, it is worth loving, it is worth healing together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish... The trouble is you won't fight. You've given in, continually dwelling on sickness and death. But there's something just as inevitable as death, and that's life. Life, life, life. Think of all the power that's in the universe, moving the earth, growing the trees. That's the same power within you if you only have the courage and the will to use it.&quot;</em> - Charlie Chaplin, Limelight 1952</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone.&quot;</em> - Isa Upanishad</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "title": "[Python] Introducing Pyxe, a simple GUI for the PyInstaller module to compile your Python projects!",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I found that PyInstaller, a module in Python that compiles scripts into executables, was a little rough to learn at the beginning. It is basically just CLI only, and figured I would try and widen the audience group to people who would prefer a GUI version. </p> <p>*What my project does*:<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/DutytoDevelop/Pyxe\">Pyxe</a> comes in with the simple goal is to make it easier for people to take a Python project and compile it into their own executable! Essentially, it's a GUI wrapper that interfaces with 'PyInstaller' which is the module that does the compiling once you provide it the various arguments, but it is CLI only.</p> <p>*Target Audience*:<br /> My target audience are Python enthusiasts that have a Python project and want to be able to compile it into a running executable, whether on Linux, Mac, or Windows. </p> <p>*Comparison*:<br /> It does seem like there is an <a href=\"https://github.com/inject3r/pyinstaller-gui\">alternative</a> that seems better than my own project. I love to develop projects from the ground up so I do not simply copy projects and make it seem like I built them. The alternative I provided does seem to have more functionality. I am not afraid to post the alternative here, as it may better help the target audience. Pyxe uses Tkinter for the GUI while the alternative, <a href=\"https://github.com/inject3r/pyinstaller-gui\">pyinstaller-gui</a>, uses PyQT. I doubt that whichever GUI is used really makes an impact, but if you are someone who wants to see how these projects are built using different GUI's, then most certainly dive in and check both of them out! </p> <p>---<br /> **It's still in the works**, but I recently got it working with Linux and MacOS after learning that you may need to install some packages beforehand to allow Pyxe to run on your operating system. Skim over the ReadMe, or look at it with a detailed mind, before you start working with this project, since there are some caveats.<br /> ---</p> <p>Since I cannot post images of the <a href=\"https://github.com/DutytoDevelop/Pyxe\">Pyxe Auto-Compiler</a> in action, I will instead provide a link to the GitHub sub-folder that provides screenshots of Pyxe to understand how it works. <a href=\"https://github.com/DutytoDevelop/Pyxe/tree/main/build_folder\">Here are where the screenshots are</a>!</p> <p>---<br /> To-Do:<br /> Fix the ability to bundle data from multiple folders into the application. It is being odd and not populating the directories correctly.</p> <p>---<br /> Let me know what you all think.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DutytoDevelop\"> /u/DutytoDevelop </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1okcm3a/python_introducing_pyxe_a_simple_gui_for_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1okcm3a/python_introducing_pyxe_a_simple_gui_for_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",

One guy wanted to make a Bracket City puzzle part of a puzzle hunt he made to propose to his girlfriend (he did it!), and that convinced me it would be fun to make something publicly available.<p>I got the Atlantic on board with the idea, and we are launching it today with an \"example\" custom puzzle: a Halloween/horror-themed puzzle by my pal Wyna Liu of NYT Connections fame.<p><a href=\"https://suburbs.bracket.city/wyna\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://suburbs.bracket.city/wyna</a><p>And we've got few other fun \"celeb\" puzzles lined up for later this year.<p>The thought is that folks can use the builder to make custom puzzles for birthday wishes/event invites/insults/proposals/break ups in addition to \u201cnormal\u201d Bracket City puzzles.<p>I'm also hoping to learn more about the potential of the format \u2013 crossword puzzles have benefited so much from the creativity of constructors \u2013 I'm hoping bracket puzzles do the same.<p>The good news is that it\u2019s way easier to construct a bracket puzzle than a crossword. Once you try it, you\u2019ll see why: you have many more degrees of freedom. In a crossword, each added word increases the level of constraint exponentially \u2014 every new entry sharply reduces the remaining options for completing the grid. Bracket puzzles are the opposite: as you add clues, you expand the available fodder for new ones.<p>Anyway, I would love any/all feedback and to try puzzles created by folks here. I\u2019m hoping we will figure out a way to highlight the best community puzzles on the Atlantic soon!<p>PS and please keep playing the main game / sending me feedback / denouncing me on the subreddit</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45772650\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45772650</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

Unlike the consumer device market, the medical device market is highly regulated and involves considerable manufacturer liability that may limit the use of open-source technology.

    "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
    "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.26490v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping creative work and problem-solving; however, prior research suggests that they may diminish unassisted creativity. To address this tension, a coach-like LLM environment was developed that embodies divergent and convergent thinking personas as two complementary processes. Effectiveness and user behavior were assessed through a controlled experiment in which participants interacted with either persona, while a control group engaged with a standard LLM providing direct answers.\n  Notably, users' perceptions of which persona best supported their creativity often diverged from objective performance measures. Trait-based analyses revealed that individual differences predict when people utilize divergent versus convergent personas, suggesting opportunities for adaptive sequencing. Furthermore, interaction patterns reflected the design thinking model, demonstrating how persona-guided support shapes creative problem-solving.\n  Our findings provide design principles for creativity support systems that strike a balance between exploration and convergence through persona-based guidance and personalization. These insights advance human-AI collaboration tools that scaffold rather than overshadow human creativity.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.26265v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Redirected walking utilizes gain adjustments within perceptual thresholds to allow natural navigation in large scale virtual environments within confined physical environments. Previous research has found that when users are distracted by some scene elements, they are less sensitive to gain values. However, the effects on detection thresholds have not been quantitatively measured. In this paper, we present a novel method that dynamically adjusts translation gain by leveraging visual distractors. We place distractors within the user's field of view and apply a larger translation gain when their attention is drawn to them. Because the magnitude of gain adjustment depends on the user's level of engagement with the distractors, the redirection process remains smooth and unobtrusive. To evaluate our method, we developed a task oriented virtual environment for a user study. Results show that introducing distractors in the virtual environment significantly raises users' translation gain thresholds. Furthermore, assessments using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and Igroup Presence Questionnaire indicate that the method maintains user comfort and acceptance, supporting its effectiveness for RDW systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.26251v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The appearance of a virtual avatar significantly influences its perceived appropriateness and the user's experience, particularly in healthcare applications. This study analyzed interactions with six avatars of varying characteristics in a patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) application to investigate correlations between avatar ratings and user preferences. Forty-seven participants completed a healthcare survey involving 30 PROMIS items (Global Health and Physical Function) and then rated the avatars on warmth, competence, attractiveness, and human-likeness, as well as their willingness to share personal data. The results showed that competence was the most critical factor in avatar selection, while human-likeness had minimal impact on health data disclosure. Gender did not significantly affect the ratings, but clothing style played a key role, with male avatars in professional attire rated higher in competence due to gender-stereotypical expectations. In contrast, professional female avatars were rated lower in warmth and attractiveness. These findings underline the importance of thoughtful avatar design in healthcare applications to enhance user experience and engagement.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.26172v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data, capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However, discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization. Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA (Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques, SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness. Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.26069v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Text prompt is the most common way for human-generative AI (GenAI) communication. Though convenient, it is challenging to convey fine-grained and referential intent. One promising solution is to combine text prompts with precise GUI interactions, like brushing and clicking. However, there lacks a formal model to model synergistic designs between prompts and interactions, hindering their comparison and innovation. To fill this gap, via an iterative and deductive process, we develop the Interaction-Augmented Instruction (IAI) model, a compact entity-relation graph formalizing how the combination of interactions and text prompts enhances human-generative AI communication. With the model, we distill twelve recurring and composable atomic interaction paradigms from prior tools, verifying our model's capability to facilitate systematic design characterization and comparison. Case studies further demonstrate the model's utility in applying, refining, and extending these paradigms. These results illustrate our IAI model's descriptive, discriminative, and generative power for shaping future GenAI systems.",

FractalBrain presents an experience combining a surreal virtual reality (VR) program with an electroencephalogram (EEG) interface. While viewing an ever-changing fractal-inspired artwork in an immersive environment, the user's EEG stream is analyzed and mapped into VR. These EEG data adaptively manipulates the audiovisual parameters in real-time, generating a distinct experience for each user. The pilot feedback suggests the potential of the FractalBrain to facilitate mindfulness and enhance attention.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.26015v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Fully automated vehicles (FAVs) hold promise for enhancing the mobility of blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. To understand the situated interaction needs of BLV passengers, we conducted six on-road, and in-lab focus groups with 16 participants, immersing them in real-world driving conditions. Our thematic analysis reveals that BLV participants express a high initial 'faith' in FAVs, but require layered, value-sensitive information during the ride to cultivate trust. The participants' modality preference for voice suggests re-evaluating the role of haptics for BLV users in FAVs. Our findings show the importance of a respectful interaction design in FAVs that both address BLV users' mobility challenges and uphold their dignity. While others have advocated for a dignity lens, our contribution lies in grounding this framework in empirical findings and unpacking what it means to design for dignity in the context of FAVs.",

Microglia are considered as a major player in the development of neurodegenerative disease yet, the molecular changes underlying brain aging and rejuvenation remain poorly understood at the single cell level. We identified and benchmarked several reproducible microglial states and a core set of genes leading to microglia activation in the mice brain. We investigated microglial heterogeneity and studied the impact of aging and parabiosis-mediated exposure of young and old blood on microglia subpopulations across four different brain regions including cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. We revealed region specific differences in microglia subpopulation composition and age-related changes, with cerebellum and striatum displaying the most distinctive profiles and dynamic shifts compared to other brain regions. We consistently observed cerebellum as the most responsive, while striatum appeared distinctive by its minimal responsiveness to these interventions. Our findings highlighted the role of microglia in brain regional vulnerability and provided a foundation for microglia-targeted treatment for modulating brain aging.",

    "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

    "title": "Electrophysiological and behavioural responses to consonant and dissonant piano chords as standardised affective stimuli",
    "content": "Although the difference between consonance and dissonance has raised interest for decades in various fields of science, isolated chords are still underutilised as standardised affective stimuli in neuroscience. In the present study, we assessed whether consonant, dissonant, and neutral sounds evoked different subjective and neurophysiological responses associated with the emotional experience. For the first time, we conducted a comprehensive study of piano timbre chord perception, combining behavioural assessments, event-related potentials (ERPs), frequency-domain electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of amplitude, neurodynamic (longrange temporal correlations (LRTC)) factors, and source analysis. In an experiment, 30 participants rated the valence of sounds (consonance, dissonance, neutral) whilst simultaneously undergoing EEG recordings. At the behavioural level, a stable valence gradient was revealed: consonance was perceived as pleasant, dissonance as unpleasant, and the neutral group of stimuli as neutral. Analysis of ERPs revealed differences in response across three time windows (90\u2013110\u202fms, 190\u2013210\u202fms, 290\u2013310\u202fms) and activation of frontotemporal and temporoparietal areas during the processing of dissonant chords. At the level of frequency and neurodynamic indices (gamma and beta bands amplitudes and LRTC), we demonstrated that classification accuracy depends on the interaction between chord type and the EEG\u2019s amplitude- and scale-invariant characteristics for dissonant and neutral stimuli. These results provide evidence that isolated chords evoke differentiated emotional and cognitive responses, highlighting their potential utility as affective stimuli in future studies.",

    "title": "CPRSCA-ResNet: a novel ResNet-based model with Channel-Partitioned Resolution Spatial-Channel Attention for EEG-based seizure detection",
    "content": "Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder caused by abnormal discharges of brain neurons, characterized by transient disturbances in consciousness, motor function, behavior, or sensation. Recurrent seizures severely impair patients\u2019 cognitive and physiological functions and increase the risk of accidental injury and premature death. Currently, clinical diagnosis of epilepsy mainly relies on manual interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, but traditional methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and susceptible to noise interference, highlighting the urgent need for efficient and accurate automated detection models. To address this, a novel Channel-Partitioned Resolution Spatial-Channel Attention (CPRSCA) mechanism was proposed in this study, and a CPRSCA-ResNet automatic seizure detection model was developed based on the ResNet-34 architecture. By incorporating fine-grained channel partitioning, multi-scale feature fusion, and multi-dimensional attention mechanisms, the proposed approach significantly enhances the precise representation of complex EEG features. Patient-dependent and patient-independent seizure detection experiments were conducted on the public CHB-MIT dataset and two local hospital datasets (JHCH and JHMCHH). The results show that, in patient-dependent experiments, the proposed model achieved accuracies of 99.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.09%, 96.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.64%, and 98.84\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.75% on the three datasets, while in patient-independent experiments, accuracies reached 78.71\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.06%, 87.15\u202f\u00b1\u202f15.32%, and 89.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.87%, respectively. These metrics consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the effectiveness and generalizability of the CPRSCA mechanism for automatic seizure detection. In summary, the proposed method provides an efficient, robust, and highly generalizable technical solution for auxiliary clinical diagnosis of epilepsy, with the potential to substantially reduce the burden of manual EEG interpretation and improve the diagnostic efficiency for patients with epilepsy.",

    "content": "Objective. Precise electrophysiological recordings and stimulation of deep brain structures in large animal models such as non-human primates require highly accurate targeting methods that are currently lacking. Approach. To address this limitation, we have integrated advanced multi-camera neuronavigation, high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography), and tailored surgical methods to chronically implant electrodes in deep structures of the macaque brain, with an accuracy below or at the millimeter scale. Main results. We first illustrate the advantage of multi-camera neuronavigation over traditional two-camera systems in 3D-printed head models, demonstrating that a submillimeter accuracy requires at least five cameras. We then introduce a detailed experimental protocol using skull-based registration for reaching submillimeter accuracies in vivo. This protocol was optimized and tested in three macaque monkeys across seven implantations targeting the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex, including five performed with skull-based registration. Next, we quantify our targeting accuracy for these two structures by in vivo neuroimaging and histological analyses. We show that our skull-based registration procedure enabled to target the entorhinal cortex with submillimetric accuracy (0.55 mm and 0.89 mm in two animals), while implantation errors for the hippocampus were slightly higher (1.11 mm and 1.68 mm in two animals). Finally, we validate our approach with electrophysiological recordings of these targeted structures during drowsiness and stimulation-induced epileptiform afterdischarges in two chronically implanted animals. Significance. This technological and surgical framework provides a means to record and stimulate deep brain structures in large animal models with submillimetric to millimetric accuracy.",

    "content": "Objective. Accurate detection and classification of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have become increasingly important for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, few open-source platforms offer both state-of-the-art computational methods and user-friendly interfaces to support practical clinical use. Approach. We present PyHFO 2.0, an enhanced open-source, Python-based platform that extends previous work by incorporating a more comprehensive set of detection methods and deep learning (DL) tools for HFO analysis. The platform now supports three commonly used detectors: short-term energy, Montreal Neurological Institute, and a newly integrated Hilbert transform-based detector. For HFO classification, PyHFO 2.0 includes DL models for artifact rejection, spike HFO detection, and identification of epileptogenic HFOs. These models are integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem for automatic loading and can be replaced with custom-trained alternatives. An interactive annotation module enables clinicians and researchers to inspect, verify, and reclassify events. Main results. All detection and classification modules were evaluated using clinical EEG datasets, supporting the applicability of the platform in both research and translational settings. Validation across multiple datasets demonstrated close alignment with expert-labeled annotations and standard tools such as RIPPLELAB. Significance. PyHFO 2.0 aims to simplify the use of computational neuroscience tools in both research and clinical environments by combining methodological rigor with a user-friendly graphical interface. Its scalable architecture and model integration capabilities support a range of applications in biomarker discovery, epilepsy diagnostics, and clinical decision support, bridging advanced computation and practical usability.",

    "title": "A methodological framework for the efficient characterization of peripheral nerve stimulation parameters",
    "content": "Objective. Restoring movement and somatosensation with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) requires precise neural activation. Because pulse amplitude (PA) and pulse width (PW) recruit axons differently, intentionally modulating both could enable more advanced PNS. However, mapping the PA-PW space is currently prohibitively time-intensive. This paper proposes and clinically validates an efficient method to characterize multiple intensities in the PA-PW space for motor and perceptual sensory applications using minimal data collection. Approach. We used cuff electrodes implanted in one participant with a spinal cord injury to generate iso-EMG activation contours and two participants with upper limb loss to generate somatosensory perceptual iso-intensity contours in the PA-PW space. Strength-duration (SD) curves were mapped to the contours using varying sample point subsets and assessed for fit quality. Finite element modeling of a human nerve and activation simulations evaluated differences in recruited axon populations across the PA-PW space. Main results. SD curves accurately fit all levels of motor activation and perceptual intensity (median and , respectively). Reliable estimates of SD curves at any intensity require only two sufficiently-spaced points (motor , sensory ). Using this data, we present and validate a novel method for efficiently characterizing the PA-PW space using SD curves, including a metric that quantifies mapping accuracy based on two sampled points. In silico, intensity-matched high-PW and high-PA stimulation recruited overlapping, but not equivalent, axon sets, with high-PA stimuli preferentially recruiting large-diameter fibers and axons farther from the contact. Significance. This method enables rapid, accurate mapping of the stimulation parameter space for clinical motor and sensory PNS. The efficiency of the proposed characterization approach enhances the clinical feasibility of multiparameter modulation, establishing a framework for further exploration of two-parameter modulation for increased selectivity and resolution, reduced fatigue, and unique percept generation.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

This article examines this possibility by providing an overview of the theoretical rationale for their relationship and a preliminary empirical study exploring the relationships between a brief measure of fragmentation proneness, distress, and nightmares among 307 undergraduate students. The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares.

    "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "content": "arXiv:2510.25978v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Augmented reality is projected to be a primary mode of information consumption on the go, seamlessly integrating virtual content into the physical world. However, the potential perceptual demands of viewing virtual annotations while navigating a physical environment could impact user efficacy and safety, and the implications of these demands are not well understood. Here, we investigate the impact of virtual path guidance and augmentation density (visual clutter) on search performance and memory. Participants walked along a predefined path, searching for physical or virtual items. They experienced two levels of augmentation density, and either walked freely or with enforced speed and path guidance. Augmentation density impacted behavior and reduced awareness of uncommon objects in the environment. Analysis of search task performance and post-experiment item recall revealed differing attention to physical and virtual objects. On the basis of these findings we outline considerations for AR apps designed for use on the go.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.25974v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Predictive modeling has the potential to enhance human decision-making. However, many predictive models fail in practice due to problematic problem formulation in cases where the prediction target is an abstract concept or construct and practitioners need to define an appropriate target variable as a proxy to operationalize the construct of interest. The choice of an appropriate proxy target variable is rarely self-evident in practice, requiring both domain knowledge and iterative data modeling. This process is inherently collaborative, involving both domain experts and data scientists. In this work, we explore how human-machine teaming can support this process by accelerating iterations while preserving human judgment. We study the impact of two human-machine teaming strategies on proxy construction: 1) relevance-first: humans leading the process by selecting relevant proxies, and 2) performance-first: machines leading the process by recommending proxies based on predictive performance. Based on a controlled user study of a proxy construction task (N = 20), we show that the performance-first strategy facilitated faster iterations and decision-making, but also biased users towards well-performing proxies that are misaligned with the application goal. Our study highlights the opportunities and risks of human-machine teaming in operationalizing machine learning target variables, yielding insights for future research to explore the opportunities and mitigate the risks.",

Here, we compare three different AR navigation aids (on-screen compass, on-screen radar and in-world vertical arrows) in a wide-area outdoor user study (n=24) where participants search for hidden virtual target items amongst physical and virtual objects. We analyzed participants' search task performance, movements, eye-gaze, survey responses and object recall. There were two key findings. First, all navigational aids enhanced search performance relative to a control condition, with some benefit and strongest user preference for in-world arrows. Second, users recalled fewer physical objects than virtual objects in the environment, suggesting reduced awareness of the physical environment. Together, these findings suggest that while navigational aids presented in AR can enhance search task performance, users may pay less attention to the physical environment, which could have undesirable side-effects.",

    "content": "arXiv:2508.06253v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Kinetics of a balanced network of neurons with a sparse grid of synaptic links is well representable by the stochastic dynamics of a generic neuron subject to an effective shot noise. The rate of delta-pulses of the noise is determined self-consistently from the probability density of the neuron states. Importantly, the most sophisticated (but robust) collective regimes of the network do not allow for the diffusion approximation, which is routinely adopted for a shot noise in mathematical neuroscience. These regimes can be expected to be biologically relevant. For the kinetics equations of the complete mean field theory of a homogeneous inhibitory network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, we introduce circular cumulants of the genuine phase variable and derive a rigorous two cumulant reduction for both time-independent conditions and modulation of the excitatory current. The low dimensional model is examined with numerical simulations and found to be accurate for time-independent states and dynamic response to a periodic modulation deep into the parameter domain where the diffusion approximation is not applicable. The accuracy of a low dimensional model indicates and explains a low embedding dimensionality of the macroscopic collective dynamics of the network. The reduced model can be instrumental for theoretical studies of inhibitory-excitatory balanced neural networks.",

Here, we develop Conditionally Linear Dynamical System (CLDS) models as a general-purpose method to characterize these dynamics. These models use Gaussian Process (GP) priors to capture the nonlinear dependence of circuit dynamics on task and behavioral variables. Conditioned on these covariates, the data is modeled with linear dynamics. This allows for transparent interpretation and tractable Bayesian inference. We find that CLDS models can perform well even in severely data-limited regimes (e.g. one trial per condition) due to their Bayesian formulation and ability to share statistical power across nearby task conditions. In example applications, we apply CLDS to model thalamic neurons that nonlinearly encode heading direction and to model motor cortical neurons during a cued reaching task.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.25976v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the actual seen images. We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT), allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image. BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.",

Consciousness demonstrates to each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness, temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.",

    "title": "InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.25943v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.",

    "title": "A more comprehensive and reliable analysis of individual differences with generalized random forest for high-dimensional data: validation and guidelines",
    "content": "Analyzing individual differences in treatment or exposure effects is a central challenge in psychology and behavioral sciences. Conventional statistical models have focused on average treatment effects, overlooking individual variability, and struggling to identify key moderators. Generalized Random Forest (GRF) can predict individualized treatment effects, but current implementations suffer from two critical limitations: (1) prediction performances vary substantially across random initializations, and (2) identification of key moderator is limited in high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce two methodological advances to address these issues. First, a seed ensemble strategy stabilizes predictions by aggregating models trained under different random initializations. Second, a backward elimination procedure systematically identifies key moderators from high-dimensional inputs. Simulation analyses across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves reliable and valid predictions across random seeds, improved performance in moderator identification, and robust generalization of independent data. To facilitate adoption and interpretation, we provide step-by-step guidance using large-scale neuroimaging dataset (N = 8,778) with reusable code. These enhancements make GRF more reliable for modeling individual differences in treatment effects, supporting data-driven hypothesis generation, and identification of responsive subgroups.",

    "title": "Exploring the Neural Correlates of Body Perception Disturbance with a Visual Hand Morph Illusion in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: An fMRI study",
    "content": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating chronic pain condition whose causal mechanisms remain poorly understood. Individuals with CRPS often experience distorted perceptions of their affected limb in terms of size and shape, accompanied by feelings of dislike and disownership. These features are collectively referred to as body perception disturbances (BPD). Evidence that both BPD and pain can rapidly reduce following a visual hand morph illusion suggests modulation of central body representations. To elucidate the neural correlates underlying these rapid perceptual changes, we investigated brain activity during the hand morph illusion using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Forty-four participants (22 with upper limb CRPS, 22 pain free controls) completed the hand morph illusion task during fMRI and provided trial-by-trial ratings of ownership, likeability, and pain of their affected hand. People with CRPS showed greater activation of the left premotor cortex (PMC) during the illusion compared with controls. Functional connectivity between the left PMC and right extrastriate body area (EBA) was also revealed in CRPS during the illusion. No main effects of the illusion, relative to a sham condition, were found on pain intensity, limb ownership, or likeability ratings. These findings provide the first identification of neural correlates of body perception disturbance in CRPS, implicating PMC EBA networks in altered body representation. Further neuroimaging research is required to define the neural signature underlying this disturbance.",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Objective. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. This represents a paradigm shift in the analysis of neural data to overcome the inherent limitations of static assumptions about functional brain connectivity. By exploiting the information provided by high temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the possibility of tracking functional network organization and reconfiguration that support brain functions at different temporal scales has been extensively explored. Approach. This review examines the current state-of-the-art of the methodological approaches for dFC analysis in biomedical science, focusing on literature from 2018 to 2024 and on the analysis of EEG and MEG data. The review primarily concentrates on methods for estimating the time-resolved functional connectivity matrix, also providing an overview of approaches for summarising and inferring dynamic information. Main results. An insight into the available methodological approaches for tracking dFC at different temporal scales is offered. Besides the classical sliding window method, advances in instantaneous dFC algorithms are described and two novel approaches are introduced: microstate-based dFC (micro-dFC) and data-driven dFC methods. For each approach, specific features are detailed, and the dataset characteristics to ensure applicability are discussed. In addition, possible post-processing procedures for extracting the dynamic properties and information of interest are presented. Significance. The undoubted potential of dFC analysis for the study of brain dynamics is highlighted, providing a guide for its application, also taking into consideration the study protocol, the nature of the data and the temporal resolution of interest. Current limitations and open challenges are also critically addressed.",

    "title": "Distinct neural routes for evaluative and informational social influence",
    "content": "Humans routinely revise their judgments based on input from others, but the brain mechanisms that distinguish evaluative from informational social influence remain unclear. We combined a preregistered electroencephalography (EEG) experiment (N = 87) with the Judge-Advisor System to identify how two common forms of social information - feedback and advice - shape judgment and decision-making. Participants made numerical estimates, received either feedback (good/bad) or advice (a specific alternative estimate) that was either close to or far from their own, and then revised their response. Across behavioral and neural indices, both information types showed proximity-dependent effects, yet diverged in their temporal dynamics. Feedback elicited a feedback-related negativity (FRN) that decreased with confidence, indicating reflexive performance monitoring. Advice produced sustained late positive complex (LPC) activity whose onset slowed with higher confidence and lower proximity, reflecting deliberate integration of external information. For both, P300 amplitudes increased with proximity, consistent with the reward value of social validation. These findings reveal two complementary neurocognitive routes by which social information guides decisions: a rapid evaluative route engaged by feedback and a slower deliberative route engaged by advice. The results identify distinct temporal signatures of how the human brain incorporates others' input to refine its own judgments.",

    "content": "Working memory (WM), the ability to maintain task-related information, is fundamental to animal behaviors. Despite significance, there is limited knowledge on how it is orchestrated by the neural activity in the brain. Here, we show that the olfactory bulb (OB) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) slow oscillations (1-30 Hz) are augmented during WM, and furthermore, the pattern of these activities convey task-related information. Moreover, we find that the OB-mPFC delta and beta power-based connectivity is enhanced by WM. On the other hand, theta oscillations have the most prominent roles in phase coupling in this circuit. We also show bidirectional information transfer, stronger in the mPFC-to-OB direction, between the two brain areas. Furthermore, during WM, beta activity in both regions is tuned by the phase of local and long-range delta as well as theta oscillations. Together, our results suggest that the dynamics of OB-mPFC circuit slow band activities underlies WM, with possible implications for other cognitive functions in health and disease.",

    "title": "Tracing the neural trajectories of evidence accumulation and motor preparation processes during voluntary decisions",
    "content": "Voluntary decisions have previously been described by where they arise in the brain and how actions corresponding to one's choice are prepared. However, the processes by which these internally guided decisions are formed and translated into action remain unclear. We tested whether neural signatures of evidence accumulation and motor preparation -- established in perceptual decision-making -- are also observed during voluntary decisions. Forty-nine adults made voluntary (free choice between two options) and forced (single specified choice) decisions while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. To isolate decision formation from action selection, all responses were made with a right-handed keypress. After applying signal deconvolution and current source density transformations, we examined three signals: the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), Mu/Beta (8 -- 30 Hz) amplitudes, and a left-hemisphere readiness potential contralateral to the response hand. For both voluntary and forced decisions, CPP and Mu/Beta amplitudes showed hallmark accumulation-to-bound dynamics -- faster responses had steeper ramping signals that converged to stereotyped pre-response amplitude levels. The left-hemisphere readiness potential likewise showed convergence to a pre-response level but with less reliable evidence for RT-dependent slope scaling, resembling a late, effector-specific motor gate rather than an evolving decision variable. Waveform amplitudes across the time course of these signals also did not differ reliably between voluntary and forced decisions. Our results indicate that, like perceptual decisions, voluntary choices are also formed by a graded accumulation process that culminates in a motor action, with the CPP indexing an evolving decision variable and Mu/Beta indexing effector-specific motor readiness.",

    "title": "Nanoscale synaptic remodeling at corticostriatal circuits predicts flexible action control",
    "content": "Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental substrate of behavioral adaptation, yet the underlying molecular dynamics remain poorly defined. We tested the hypothesis that, within striatal circuits, flexibility relies on nanoscale remodeling of synaptic machinery coupling anterograde glutamatergic transmission to retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, a process disrupted in states of rigidity and aging. In the dorsolateral striatum, we found cell-type-specific facilitation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5)-dependent, endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression at cortico-striatal synapses of indirect pathway neurons in flexible goal-directed behavior, but not after training promoting inflexibility. Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) super-resolution imaging revealed that behavioral adaptation, but not rigidity, is accompanied by increased postsynaptic abundance of mGlu5 and diacylglycerol lipase- (DAGL), an endocannabinoid-synthesizing enzyme, and presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors. In parallel, the nanoscale distance between mGlu5 and DAGL is reduced in postsynaptic spine heads. These nanoscale changes emerged within the time window required for behavioral updating. Intriguingly, the molecular densities of mGlu5, DAGL, and CB1 receptors predict the strength of behavioral adaptation. In aging mice, these nanoscale changes were absent in association with behavioral rigidity. These findings identify a nanoscale synaptic remodeling mechanism that enables behavioral flexibility and reveal how its failure contributes to rigidity, including that observed in aging.",

    "title": "Neural Substrates of Approach-Avoidance Control in Motivational Conflict",
    "content": "Adaptive behavior requires control over automatic tendencies to approach reward and avoid threat. Dysregulation of this control characterizes disorders such as anxiety or addiction, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated circuits engaged during approach-avoidance control using fMRI with concurrent eye-tracking, and behavioral measures. Forty participants (22 females) completed an approach-avoidance conflict task with free- and forced-choice trials. Each trial comprised anticipation, response (using a joystick to approach/obtain or avoid/forgo outcomes), and outcome phases. Before scanning, participants learned that conditioned stimuli (CS) predicted an aversive stimulation (avCS+), appetitive reward (appCS+), both outcomes (confCS+), or no outcome (neuCS-). Discordant responses (e.g., approaching avCS+) were slower than concordant responses (e.g., avoiding avCS+), confirming heightened control demands. Overcoming threat-driven avoidance specifically recruited the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), while suppressing reward-driven approach lacked distinct neural signatures. During anticipation, confCS+ and avCS+ showed overlapping activation in salience-control networks, including middle/anterior cingulate cortex (MCC/ ACC), anterior insula, IFG, and ventral striatum (VS). Interestingly, confCS+ evoked threat-like anticipatory neurophysiological responses (pupil dilation; ACC/insula activation) but subsequently triggered reward-like approach behavior. Multivariate pattern and psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that this dissociation was driven by differential encoding of upcoming responses in the ventral striatum during the anticipation phase and by altered functional coupling between the VS and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). These findings indicate that motivational control prioritizes salience over valence and suggest a VS-rTPJ network for resolving approach-avoidance conflicts, offering novel insights into neural dynamics of flexible goal-directed behavior.",

    "title": "PCSK9 and High-Fat Diet Synergistically Induce Neurovascular Dysfunction and Neuroinflammation",
    "content": "Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is strongly linked to metabolic risk factors and represents a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. The interactions of genetic and environmental risk factors driving cerebrovascular pathology in metabolic syndrome are poorly understood. Here, we characterize neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative phenotypes in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome with atherosclerosis induced by hepatic proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) overexpression combined with high-fat diet (HFD). PCSK9+HFD mice exhibit hallmark features of CSVD including vascular rarefaction, impaired neurovascular coupling, blood-brain barrier disruption, white matter injury, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits. Notably, we identify lipid-droplet accumulating microglia (LDAM) as a distinct cellular phenotype that emerges in response to metabolic stress and correlates with cerebrovascular dysfunction. Three-dimensional light sheet microscopy reveals widespread vascular network disruption. Immunophenotyping demonstrates that microglia in PCSK9+HFD group exhibit enhanced phagocytic activation and ramification complexity yet accumulate perivascular amyloid-{beta}, suggesting impaired clearance capacity. Importantly, we observed vascular amyloid-{beta} deposition in wild-type mice without genetic Alzheimer's disease mutations, suggesting that metabolic stress contributes to cerebrovascular amyloid pathology. PCSK9+HFD mice displayed recognition memory deficits and increased anxiety-like behavior. Our findings establish that severe hypercholesterolemia accelerates CSVD pathogenesis, and identify LDAM as a distinct pathological feature linking systemic metabolic syndrome to cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment.",

    "title": "Position-dependent effects of SCN2A premature stop codons on neuronal excitability and behavior",
    "content": "SCN2A encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2, a key determinant of spike initiation and propagation in glutamatergic neurons. Premature termination codons are often assumed to produce uniform haploinsufficiency via nonsense-mediated decay, yet whether distinct SCN2A premature stop codons yield equivalent molecular, cellular, and behavioral outcomes remains unknown. We generated two mouse lines carrying patient mutations -- Scn2aY84X/+ (p.Tyr84UAA; early coding sequence) and Scn2aR1627X/+ (p.Arg1627UGA; terminal coding exon) -- on a C57BL/6J background. Allele-specific expression was quantified by targeted next-generation sequencing of whole-brain reverse transcribed cDNA. NaV1.2 protein was measured in half-brain lysates by automated western blot and ex vivo whole-cell recordings were obtained from layer 5b pyramidal-tract neurons in medial prefrontal cortex. A panel of behavioral assays assessed locomotion/exploration, motor learning, anxiety-like behavior, sociability, sensorimotor gating, and seizure susceptibility. Allele-specific RNA handling diverged by position: mRNA carrying Y84X engaged partial nonsense-mediated decay, whereas R1627X transcripts were at allelic balance. Despite this difference in RNA fate, NaV1.2 protein was comparably reduced in both lines. Electrophysiologically, both premature termination codon mutations slowed the action-potential upstroke, with a larger decrement in Scn2aY84X/+ than in Scn2aR1627X/+. Spike threshold was depolarized only in Scn2aY84X/+, whereas Scn2aR1627X/+ remained similar to wild type. Frequency-current relations showed reduced firing at near-rheobase inputs in both mutants, with responses approaching wild type at stronger currents. Behaviorally, locomotion, sociability, and sensorimotor gating were preserved. Both lines exhibited increased grooming, consistent with restrictive, repetitive behavior; Scn2aY84X/+ alone showed greater exploration in the elevated-risk context and a male-predominant deficit in rotarod learning. In maximal electroshock testing, mortality was lower in both lines without differences in seizure threshold or severity. Our results show that distinct SCN2A premature termination codons are not equivalent to one another, nor to a uniform haploinsufficient state. An early, nonsense-mediated decay-competent premature stop codon (Y84X) and a terminal-exon one (R1627X) produce partially overlapping yet allele-specific effects on neuronal excitability and behavior. These findings establish premature termination codon position as a determinant of phenotype, supporting allele-tailored mechanistic studies and therapeutic strategies.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has identified brain systems that reliably underpin specific abilities, including verbal short-term memory. However, there is no simple mapping between anatomy and function; moreover, brains are differently organised across people. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, and using transcranial magnetic brain stimulation to test causality, we characterised differences in the neural processes supporting verbal short-term memory in healthy participants who varied in their reliance on semantic information. In group analyses, left anterior inferior parietal cortex showed the expected pattern for a 'phonological buffer' - this site was responsive to phonological tasks and verbal short-term memory for meaningless items. However, the functions of this site differed across the sample; individuals with the strongest semantic reliance in short-term memory showed weaker phonological responses. They also showed more activation when maintaining meaningful word sequences in short-term memory, compared with nonwords. In these semantically reliant participants, left anterior inferior parietal cortex showed stronger functional connectivity to limbic and default mode regions during nonword rehearsal. While inhibitory stimulation to phonologically responsive regions disrupted nonwords more than words in people with good phonological short-term memory, these effects were reversed when verbal short-term memory was more semantically reliant. These findings show that left anterior inferior parietal cortex supports the maintenance of different kinds of verbal information across individuals.",

    "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
    "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

    "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
    "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

    "title": "Social Reward Learning Deficits and Concordant Brain Alterations in Rats Overexpressing Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)",
    "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",

    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "Evidence for an Active Handoff between Hemispheres during Target Tracking",
    "content": "<p>The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as two male nonhuman primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power, gamma (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. In contrast, alpha (10&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz) power, theta (4&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active handoff of information between hemispheres. This \"handshaking\" operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.</p>",

    "title": "Exposure to Bullying Engages Social Distress Circuits in the Adolescent and Adult Brain",
    "content": "<p>Despite advances in understanding the psychological and social consequences of peer victimization, the immediate effects of bullying on the central nervous system remain elusive. Here we mapped the neural, affective, and attentional responses to simulated bullying in adolescents and adults and tested whether these responses are associated with real-life victimization experiences. Fifty-one adolescents (29 females, 22 males) aged 11&ndash;14&nbsp;years and 47 adults (29 females, 18 males) underwent a functional MRI (fMRI) while watching first-person videos of bullying (victimization) in the school environment, as well as neutral and positive social interactions in a similar setting. Additionally, 57 adults (36 females, 21 males) watched the same videos during an eye tracking experiment. Exposure to bullying versus positive social interaction engaged the socioemotional and threat response systems, as well as regions related to social cognition, sensory and interoceptive processing, and motor control. These responses were consistent across adolescents and adults and were associated with the current and past victimization experiences of the participants. This large-scale activation of neural systems subserving socioemotional, somatosensory, and interoceptive processing was in line with the amplified emotional and attentional responses revealed by larger pupil size and higher fixation frequency during simulated bullying in the eye tracking experiment. Altogether these results highlight how peer victimization evokes a state of stress and alarm in the central nervous system.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Spatial attention is often conceptualized as a flexible \"zoom lens\" that can dynamically adjust its focus, but most evidence stems from studies of voluntary attention. Our study investigates whether involuntary, reflexive attention exhibits similar adaptability in attentional scope. Using behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) experiments with exogenous cues of varying spatial extent, we examined how attentional gradients dynamically adjust when attention is involuntarily captured. Male and female human participants performed visual search tasks preceded by narrow- or broad-cue displays at different onset asynchronies. We applied inverted encoding models to alpha-band neural activity to precisely track the locus and breadth of attentional tuning. Across experiments, we found that reflexive attentional gradients flexibly adapt to match cue characteristics. Behaviorally, narrow cues yielded progressively sharper attentional gradients compared with broad cues, with differences emerging over time. Critically, EEG analyses revealed that alpha-band activity tracked these dynamic adjustments, with differences in spatial selectivity emerging rapidly (&plusmn;200&nbsp;ms postcue) and continuing to evolve. Contrary to previous suggestions that involuntary attention primarily influences response efficiency, our results demonstrate that exogenous cues modulate attentional resources across the visual field at early processing stages.</p>",

    "title": "Rebound Bursting Selectively Enables Fast Dynamics in Dopamine Midbrain Neurons Projecting to the Dorsolateral Striatum",
    "content": "<p>Dopamine (DA) midbrain neurons are involved in a wide array of key brain functions including movement control and reward-based learning. They are also critical for major brain disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease or schizophrenia. DA neurons projecting to distinct striatal territories are diverse with regard to their molecular makeup and cellular physiology, which are likely to contribute to the observed differences in temporal DA dynamics. Among these regions, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) displays the fastest DA dynamics, which might control the moment-to-moment vigor and variability of voluntary movements. However, the underlying mechanisms for these DLS-specific fast DA fluctuations are unresolved. Here, we show that DLS-projecting DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) possess a unique biophysical profile allowing immediate 10-fold accelerations in discharge frequency via rebound bursting. By using a combination of in vitro patch-clamp recordings in projection-defined DA SN subpopulations from adult male mice and developing matching projection-specific computational models, we demonstrate that a strong interaction of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 and SK channels specific for DLS-projecting Aldh1a1&ndash;positive DA SN (DLS-DA) neurons controls the gain of fast rebound bursting, while K<sub>v</sub>4 and HCN channels mediate timing of rebound excitability. In addition, GIRK channels activated by D2 and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors prevent rebound bursting in these DLS-DA neurons. Furthermore, our in vivo patch-clamp recordings and matching in vivo computational models provide evidence that these unique rebound properties might be preserved in the intact brain, where they might endow specific computational properties well suited for the generation of fast DA dynamics present in DLS.</p>",

    "title": "Linking Connectivity Dynamics to Symptom Severity and Cognitive Abilities in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: An FNIRS Study",
    "content": "<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating neurobiological markers in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While previous studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in ASD children compared with typically developing (TD) peers, brain connectivity dynamics and their associations with autism symptoms and cognitive abilities remain underexplored. We analyzed fNIRS data from 44 children (30 boys, 21 ASD/23 TD) aged 2.08&ndash;6.67&nbsp;years while they viewed a silent cartoon. Using sliding window correlation and <i>k</i>-means clustering, we assessed group differences in dynamic connectivity and the correlations with symptom severity and cognitive performance. Our results revealed that children with ASD showed reduced dwell time in a specific brain state and fewer state transitions compared with TD children. These atypical brain state patterns were negatively correlated with autism symptom severity and positively correlated with adaptive behavior and cognitive performance across participants. Mediation analysis revealed that adaptive behavior fully mediated the relationship between brain dynamics and cognitive performance. Furthermore, dynamic connectivity features achieved 74.4% accuracy in distinguishing ASD from TD children. Importantly, the link between brain dynamics and cognitive performance was replicated in an independent TD sample, underscoring the robustness of this finding. Together, these findings highlight altered brain dynamics in young children with ASD and underscore the critical role of adaptive behavior in bridging neural activity and cognitive performance. These insights advance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying ASD and point to potential pathways for early interventions and clinical applications.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are major charge carriers mediating neuronal excitation and play a fundamental role in brain physiology. Glutamatergic synaptic activity is accompanied by large transient Na<sup>+</sup> increases, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of Na<sup>+</sup> signals and properties of Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion within dendrites are largely unknown. To address these questions, we employed multiphoton Na<sup>+</sup> imaging combined with whole-cell patch clamp in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in tissue slices from mice of both sexes. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed a dendritic baseline Na<sup>+</sup> concentration of ~10&nbsp;mM. Using intensity-based line scan imaging, we found that local, glutamate-evoked Na<sup>+</sup> signals spread rapidly within dendrites, with peak amplitudes decreasing and latencies increasing with increasing distance from the site of stimulation. Spread of Na<sup>+</sup> along dendrites was independent of dendrite diameter, order, or overall spine density in the ranges measured. Our experiments also show that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> readily invades spines and suggest that spine necks may represent a partial diffusion barrier. Experimental data were well reproduced by mathematical simulations assuming normal diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of <i>D</i><sub>Na+</sub> = 600&nbsp;&micro;m<sup>2</sup>/s. Modeling moreover revealed that lateral diffusion is key for the clearance of local Na<sup>+</sup> increases at early time points, whereas when diffusional gradients are diminished, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase becomes more relevant. Taken together, our study thus demonstrates that Na<sup>+</sup> influx causes rapid lateral diffusion of Na<sup>+</sup> within spiny dendrites. This results in an efficient redistribution and fast recovery from local Na<sup>+</sup> transients which is mainly governed by concentration differences.</p>",

    "content": "<p>BLTP1 (Bridge-Like Lipid Transfer Protein Family Member 1), previously known as Tweek, Kiaa1109, FSA, or 4932438A13Rik, is a nonvesicular lipid transport protein linked to Alkuraya&ndash;Ku&#x010d;inskas syndrome (AKS), an autosomal recessive disorder with severe brain malformations and arthrogryposis in humans. Although BLTP1 is known to be involved in the transfer of phospholipids between organellar membranes at membrane contact sites, its specific role during mammalian development remains poorly defined. Here we characterized the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in <i>Bltp1</i> knock-out (<i>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></i>) mice of either sex. These mutant mice die perinatally, exhibiting reduced growth of intramuscular motor nerves and a reduction in the size of the NMJ, compared with littermate controls. Electrophysiological analysis of the diaphragm muscle in <i>Bltp1</i><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> embryos reveals defects in synaptic transmission at the NMJ. Notably, the frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release is markedly increased, whereas evoked neurotransmitter release and quantal content are reduced. In addition, neuromuscular synapses in <i>Bltp1</i><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice fail to respond to a repetitive stimulation. Remarkably, the impairment of intramuscular nerve growth in <i>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></i> embryos is restored by supplementing pregnant dams with lecithin, a mixture of unsaturated phospholipids naturally present in foods, although lecithin supplement does not improve the overall survival of these mutant mice. Together, these results demonstrate that BLTP1 plays important roles during development for proper intramuscular nerve growth and neuromuscular synaptic function and suggest that AKS patients may benefit from phospholipid supplementation such as lecithin.</p>",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models.

These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

    "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

    "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
    "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

This study aimed to validate and extend the MHP by analyzing P300 and Bereitschaftspotential (BP) brainwave components.MethodsOur initial finding of qualitatively different neural signatures between correct and incorrect trials led to the hypothesis that the \u201ccorrect\u201d trial group is a mixture of different processing types. We tested this by segregating correct trials based on the presence or absence of the P300 component, which we reasoned is a key marker of the MHP\u2019s conscious \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process.ResultsWe identified a P300-absent subgroup even among correct responses. This subgroup exhibited significantly shorter reaction times than its P300-present counterpart and showed a neural signature strikingly similar to that of incorrect trials, including a delayed negative peak in the BP.DiscussionThese results suggest the human information processing pathway is not monolithic. We propose a new model that bifurcates after perception into either a \u201cDeliberate Process\u201d (P300-present), which aligns with the MHP, or a high-speed \u201cAutomatic Process\u201d (P300-absent) that bypasses the MHP\u2019s \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process.

    "content": "IntroductionHypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare transsynaptic neurodegenerative disorder arising from disruption of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT), a neural circuit critical for motor coordination. Classical clinical presentation includes palatal tremor. While cerebrovascular etiology dominates reported cases, HOD secondary to intracranial infections remains poorly characterized, posing diagnostic challenges.Case presentationA 72-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension presented with a 7-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting. Initial neuroimaging revealed right cerebellar hematoma with multiple brain abscesses. Antibacterial treatment achieved symptomatic improvement, but follow-up was lost. Seven months later, readmission occurred due to memory decline and personality changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T2-weighted hyperintensity in the left anterior medulla oblongata and hemosiderosis in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Despite the absence of clinical manifestations of HOD, prior abscess-induced GMT involvement strongly supported the diagnosis. Symptomatic management stabilized the patient, with persistent lesions but no clinical progression at 5-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case documents a rare case of HOD following bacterial brain abscess, presenting with atypical clinical features. It expands the etiological spectrum of HOD and underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion in post-infectious neurological deterioration. Multimodal MRI facilitates early diagnosis and timely intervention, highlighting its critical role in managing this underrecognized entity.",

This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

    "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "title": "Universal differential equations as a unifying modeling language for neuroscience",
    "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",

    "title": "Differences in structural brain morphometry between musicians and non-musicians",
    "content": "ObjectiveAlthough music has been shown to affect brain function, the structural characteristics of the brain in musicians compared to non-musicians are often overlooked. This limited attention restricts the practical use of music\u2019s emotional, cognitive, and motor functions. The current study aimed to investigate structural differences in the brains of musicians compared to non-musicians in order to better understand the neuroanatomical basis of musical training.MethodsSixteen musicians and seventeen age-matched non-musicians underwent a brain structural neuroimaging scan. Group differences in structural morphometry were assessed.ResultsSignificant differences were found in cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth measures. Compared to non-musicians, musicians showed greater cortical thickness in the left superior frontal gyrus and right central parietal region, and showed structural advantages in fractal dimensionality and sulcal depth in the left fusiform gyrus and right central region. In contrast, non-musicians showed greater gyrification in the bilateral insula, right superior parietal lobule, and right supramarginal gyrus. Notably, significant interactive effects were observed between gender and cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth in regions of the limbic system, including the hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, insula, fusiform gyrus, and precuneus.ConclusionStructural differences in the frontal cortex, limbic system, and sensorimotor areas between musicians and non-musicians highlight the changes in brain structure associated with musical training. These findings provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of music-related brain function and may provide guidance for future applications of music to improve mental health and neuroplasticity.",

    "content": "BackgroundAcute stress may disrupt decision - making by affecting cognitive and emotional processing. The behavioral and neural mechanisms of this in athletes are unclear. This study explored how acute stress impacts athletes\u2019 unfairness - related decision - making and its neural basis.MethodsForty participants (20 university athletes and 20 non-athletes) were randomly assigned to a stress group or a control group. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the study monitored the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) blood oxygenation during an ultimatum game task after inducing acute stress via the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST).ResultsAthletes under stress were more accepting of relatively unfair decisions than non-athletes. This was linked to lower activation in the frontal-eye areas (CH15), supramarginal gyrus (CH38), and somatosensory association cortex (CH67), and higher activation in the primary motor cortex (CH64) in athletes. The increase in acceptance efficiency correlated significantly with the reduced CH38 activation (r = \u22120.425) and increased CH64 activation (r = 0.499).ConclusionLong-term exercise training may promote athletes\u2019 tendency to accept relatively unfair decisions under acute stress by modulating activation levels in the supramarginal gyrus and primary motor cortex, demonstrating stronger adaptive behavior. These findings offer insights for developing stress management and neuromodulation training programs for athletes.",

    "title": "Rising burden of subarachnoid hemorrhage linked to high systolic blood pressure among young and middle-aged populations: temporal trends and global implication",
    "content": "BackgroundSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular event that leads to high mortality and long-term disability, particularly among adults aged 25\u201349 years. Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the leading modifiable risk factor, yet its global burden in this age group has not been systematically assessed.MethodsWe analyzed population-level epidemiological data across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021 to estimate SAH mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to high SBP. Temporal trends were evaluated using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), and future trajectories to 2050 were projected with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.ResultsGlobally, SAH caused 24,908 deaths and 1,373,366 DALYs in 2021 due to high SBP in adults aged 25\u201349 years. Males had higher rates than females (mortality: 0.78 vs. 0.48 per 100,000; DALYs: 42.4 vs. 27.0 per 100,000), though females experienced steeper declines (EAPC_mortality: \u22121.78%). The highest burden was in the 45\u201349 age group (deaths: 9,768; DALYs: 474,092). From 1990 to 2021, high-SDI regions achieved the greatest reductions in mortality (\u221250.3%) and DALYs (\u221246.8%), while low-SDI regions saw increases in deaths (+109.5%) and DALYs (+114.7%). Nationally, Zimbabwe and Guatemala showed the sharpest increases in mortality (EAPC: +4.71% and +3.76%), while Sweden and Swiss Confederation achieved the greatest declines (EAPC: \u22125.5% and \u22124.9%). Forecasts suggest continued global declines by 2050, but widening disparities by sex, age, and socio-demographic status.ConclusionAlthough the global burden of SAH attributable to high SBP is decreasing, young and middle-aged adults-especially males and those in low-SDI regions-continue to face substantial risks. Targeted hypertension control and region-specific prevention strategies are urgently needed.",

    "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

    "title": "Autism spectrum disorder and the role of nuclear hormone receptors: insights and therapeutic implications",
    "content": "Autism spectrum disorder is a neurological and developmental condition known to impact a person's learning, communication, and interpersonal interactions. Recent research has highlighted the role of nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) in neurodevelopment and synaptic function, suggesting their potential involvement in ASD pathophysiology. NHRs regulate gene expression that are critical for neural differentiation, plasticity, and metabolic processes. Dysregulation of these receptors can lead to altered neural circuit formation and neurotransmitter imbalances, which are commonly observed in ASD. Understanding the interplay between NHRs and ASD could open new avenues for therapeutic interventions, providing hope for more personalized approaches to managing the disorder. One key receptor is retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-alpha (RORA), which was shown to be reduced in individuals with ASD. Among its numerous functions during development, RORA was shown to regulate the transcription of genes involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptic function, and neuroprotection. Studies have identified that RORA expression is reduced in individuals with ASD, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, affecting transcription of multiple ASD-associated genes. In the present review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms leading to ASD pathophysiology, various treatment modalities, the prospects of the RORA gene therapy approach, and future perspectives.",

    "title": "Geometric and dosimetric evaluation of auto-segmentation of brain arteriovenous malformations using multimodal imaging in stereotactic radiosurgery",
    "content": "BackgroundOptimizing radiation dose to protect white matter (WM) tracts during stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) necessitates the integration of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based WM tractography to delineate WM tracts and establish dose constraints. Conventional manual delineation of perilesional targets demonstrated significant operational inefficiency, primarily attributed to the complex structural interdigitation between pathological vasculature and eloquent brain areas.PurposeThis study aimed to develop a two-stage deep learning (DL) method that combines a two-dimensional (2D) U-Net detection-aided and three-dimensional (3D) self-attention segmentation model for automatic bAVM segmentation. This method focuses on improving efficiency in clinical practice while protecting WM tracts using multimodal imaging and WM tractography in SRS.MethodsWe analyzed imaging data from 191 patients who underwent CyberKnife-based SRS at Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, with bAVMs closely adjacent to WM tracts. A total of 153 patients were used to construct a two-stage DL model to segment the bAVMs on multimodal imaging and WM tractography, while the remaining 38 patients were utilized to validate the model's performance. We introduced spatial and channel attention modules in the U-Net variant, along with a versatile \u201cAttentional ResBlock,\u201d achieving parameter efficiency through cross-dimensional interaction while preserving model fidelity. The accuracy of the auto-segmented contours is evaluated using geometric indices and dosimetric endpoints.ResultsOur proposed model demonstrated superior segmentation performance, achieving a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.84 \u00b1 0.05, sensitivity of 0.92 \u00b1 0.09, and F2-score of 0.79 \u00b1 0.08. Furthermore, it attained a low Hausdorff distance (4.55 \u00b1 1.14 mm) and mean surface distance (0.53 \u00b1 0.08 mm), indicating exceptional boundary delineation precision. The difference in the proportion of WM tracts within the target region between manual and our automated contours is minimal (0.08 \u00b1 0.13). Meanwhile, strong concordance is observed between auto-segmented and manually contoured targets across the majority of dosimetric endpoints, with a mean difference of 0.46 Gy. The received dose of WM tracts in the two comparison plans also has an acceptable representation of dosimetric parameters (R2 = 0.92 for Dmean and 0.88 for V1Gy). Dose exposition of the organ at risk (OAR) shows no statistically significant differences in treatment plans with auto-segmentation targets compared to regular plans.ConclusionThe reliable bAVM automated-segmentation method has been validated and may support SRS planning for bAVMs and thus avoid neurological sequelae after SRS in considering WM tracts protection.",

    "title": "Deep learning in intracranial EEG for seizure detection: advances, challenges, and clinical applications",
    "content": "Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the automated detection and classification of seizure events from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. In this review, we synthesize recent advancements in deep learning techniques including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) units, and transformer based architectures that enable accurate localization of epileptogenic zones (EZ) in drug resistant epilepsy. These approaches effectively extract spatial and temporal features from raw iEEG signals to detect epileptiform discharges (ED) including seizures alongside other electro-physiological biomarkers such as high-frequency oscillations (HFO). Importantly, beyond relying solely on these traditional markers, several studies have indicated direct seizure detection by modeling ictal and preictal dynamics. Such methods capture alternative biomarkers including spectral changes, connectivity patterns, and complex temporal signatures that directly reflect seizure activity. Although deep learning models often achieve high accuracy, they continue to face several challenges due to data scarcity, heterogeneity in iEEG acquisition, inconsistent preprocessing protocols, and limited model interpretability. We also highlight emerging integrative strategies that combine multimodal neuroimaging data with deep learning analyses as well as neuromorphic computing techniques designed for real-time clinical application. Addressing these limitations has significant potential for surgical planning, reducing diagnostic subjectivity, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in epilepsy care.",

    "content": "Objective. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the convolutional spider neural network (CS-Net), combined with a transfer learning (TL) strategy, to classify hybrid gestures that integrate wrist postures and hand movements. Approach. The CS-Net framework incorporates diverse surface electromyography (sEMG) features, including raw signals and FFT representations, through a multi-stream information fusion mechanism to enhance classification performance. The proposed TL strategy involves pre-training the model on specific wrist postures and fine-tuning it on the full set of hybrid gestures, leveraging the intrinsic relationships between composite gestures and their constituent movements to improve accuracy. The framework is evaluated through extensive offline experiments using a dataset of 12 hybrid gestures (combining three wrist postures and four hand movements) collected from six subjects, comparing its performance against three deep learning algorithms in sEMG recognition filed. Main results. The average experimental result for the proposed CS-Net with TL reached 90.6%. Additionally, its generalization ability is validated with the Ninapro public databases, which are DB1, DB4, and DB5. The 30 action classification accuracy of CS-Net on the Ninapro datasets was 68.7%, 61.5% and 66.3%, respectively. To demonstrate practical applicability, real-time online experiments involving object grasping tasks is conducted, achieving a success rate of 90%. Significance. The results show that CS-Net significantly improves sEMG classification accuracy, while the TL strategy further enhances performance. Moreover, the algorithm achieved a high success rate in online experiments, confirming its robustness and practical utility for real-world applications. Our hybrid gesture dataset and source codes are available on Github.",

Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

    "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
    "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

    "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "title": "Optimizing real-time phase detection in diverse rhythmic biological signals for phase-specific neurostimulation",
    "content": "Objective. Closed-loop, phase-specific neurostimulation is a powerful method to modulate ongoing brain activity for clinical and research applications. Phase-specific stimulation relies on estimating the phase of an ongoing oscillation in real time and issuing a control command at a target phase. Phase detection algorithms based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are widely used due to their computational efficiency and robustness. However, it is unclear how algorithm performance depends on the spectral properties of the input signal and how algorithm parameters can be optimized. Approach. We evaluated the in silico performance of three phase detection algorithms [Endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT), Hilbert transform (HT), and phase mapping (PM)] on three real-world biological signals with distinct spectral properties (theta oscillations from rodent hippocampal local field potential, alpha oscillations from human electroencephalogram (EEG), and hand movement kinematics from essential tremor patients) to identify the optimal model and parameters. We then validated the performance of an algorithm for estimating theta phase in real-time using rats implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus. Results. First, we found that signal amplitude and frequency variations strongly influence algorithm performance. Frequency-specific signal-to-noise ratio was positively correlated with performance (mean R2 = 0.42 across metrics), while amplitude and frequency variability were negatively correlated (mean R2 = 0.50 across metrics). Second, we showed that the length of the data window used for phase estimation is the key parameter for optimal performance of FFT-based algorithms, where the optimal data window length corresponds to the period of the oscillation (\u223c150 ms for hippocampal theta oscillations, \u223c100 ms for human EEG alpha, and \u223c125 ms for essential tremor kinematics). We validated this finding in vivo by estimating the phase of theta oscillations from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, where a data window length corresponding to one theta cycle yielded the best performance across all metrics compared with shorter or longer window lengths. Significance. Our findings clarify the relationship between signal properties and algorithm performance and provide a convenient method for optimizing FFT-based phase detection algorithms. We show that a data window length corresponding to one cycle of an oscillation can lead to improved performance.",

    "title": "Multitarget neurostimulation of the deep brain: clinical opportunities, challenges, and emerging technologies",
    "content": "Recent computational, pre-clinical, and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential for using neuromodulation through simultaneous targeting of multiple deep brain regions. This approach has already been used for therapeutic and systems neuroscience applications. However, the broad clinical adoption of invasive distributed deep brain interfaces remains in its early stages. This review explores the barriers to implementation by addressing three key questions: do the benefits of implanting multiple electrodes justify the associated risks for specific applications? What is the risk-benefit ratio, and what technological advancements will be necessary to encourage clinical adoption? We also examine next-generation technologies that could enable multi-target brain interfaces, including system-on-chip micro-stimulators as well as nanoparticles. We highlight the role of novel machine learning algorithms in the optimization of stimulation parameters and for the guidance of device placement. Emerging hardware accelerators equipped with on-chip AI have demonstrated functionality that can be used to decode and to classify distributed neuronal data. This advance in hardware accelerators has also contributed to the potential for enhanced closed-loop stimulation control of devices. Despite these advances, significant technological and translational barriers persist, limiting the widespread clinical application of multi-target brain interfaces. This review provides a critical analysis of recent prototypes and novel hardware for use in multi-target systems. We will discuss both clinical and research applications. We will focus on the utilization of multi-site technologies to meet the needs of neurological diseases. We conclude that there exists a critical need for further innovation and integration of multi-site technologies into clinical practice.",

However, the underlying neural mechanisms are currently unknown. When applied to the human motor cortex, a-tDCS reduces the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter that modulates neuroplasticity. Our primary aim was to assess whether the same a-tDCS paradigm alters local GABA...",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">First, I guess I should've avoided the word \"rhetorical.\" &nbsp;In my post, I characterized Ioannidis's 2005 claim, type M and S errors, and multiverse analysis as \"rhetorical tools\" that have been been useful in the field of science criticism but which I would not use in my own analyses. &nbsp;I could've added to this many other statistical methods including p-values and Bayes factors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One very obvious way to see that I never thought Type M and Type S errors \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis'\" is that, since the appearance of that article in 2014, I've published dozens of applied papers, and in only very few of these did I look at Type M and Type S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

To date, the performance of the trim and fill\nmethod has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more\ncomprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in\na number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those\nfrom usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely\nuse of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in\nthe meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the\nperformance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study\nheterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive\neffect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is\npresent the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than\nthe usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate\nfrom the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the\npresence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our\nsimulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the\npresence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce\nthe bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not\nideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly\ncaused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the\nperformance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various\nmeta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form\nof sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.2889&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n17476644&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;4544-4562&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Performance\nof the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and\nbetween-study\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Peters&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jaime\nL.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Sutton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Alex\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;David\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Abrams&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Keith\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Rushton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lesley&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2007&quot;,11,10]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/DMQP989N&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;It\nis known that the existence of publication bias can influence the conclusions\nof a meta-analysis. Some methods have been developed to deal with publication\nbias, but issues remain. One particular method called 'trim and fill' is\ndesigned to adjust for publication bias. The method, which is intuitively\nappealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a simple and\npopular graphical tool called the funnel plot. We present a simulation study\ndesigned to evaluate the behaviour of this method. Our results indicate that\nwhen the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they estimate different\neffects), trim and fill may inappropriately adjust for publication bias where\nnone exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously adjust for non-existent\nbias if (i) the variability among studies causes some precisely estimated\nstudies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii) an inverse\nrelationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is introduced by the\nstudies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest that the funnel plot\nitself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses. Selection modelling is\nan alternative method warranting further study. It performed better than trim\nand fill in our simulations, although its frequency of convergence varied,\ndepending on the simulation parameters.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.1461&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n12820277&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;2113-2126&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Adjusting\nfor publication bias in the presence of\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Terrin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Norma&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schmid&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Christopher\nH.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lau&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joseph&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Olkin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ingram&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2003&quot;,7,15]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Peters\net al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

Specifying a\nrange of values around zero allows researchers to statistically reject the\npresence of effects large enough to matter, and prevents practically\ninsignificant effects from being interpreted as a statistically significant\ndifference. We compare the behavior of the recently proposed second generation\np-value (Blume, D\u2019Agostino McGowan, Dupont, &amp; Greevy, 2018) with the more\nestablished Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) equivalence testing procedure\n(Schuirmann, 1987). We show that the two approaches yield almost identical\nresults under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g., when the\nconfidence interval is wider than the equivalence range, or when confidence\nintervals are asymmetric) the second generation p-value becomes difficult to\ninterpret. The second generation p-value is interpretable in a dichotomous\nmanner (i.e., when the SGPV equals 0 or 1 because the confidence intervals lies\ncompletely within or outside of the equivalence range), but this dichotomous\ninterpretation does not require calculations. We conclude that equivalence\ntests yield more consistent p-values, distinguish between datasets that yield\nthe same second generation p-value, and allow for easier control of Type I and\nType II error rates.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.933&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Daniel Lakens, Marie Delacre&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;1-11&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Equivalence\nTesting and the Second Generation\nP-Value&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Delacre&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marie&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,7,13]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lakens\n&amp; Delacre, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

We then\npropose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the\nreplication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The\nreplication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we\ncould gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a)\nthe value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim\nbased on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal\ndecision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph\nmodeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of\nexpected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative\nestimates of replication value.

We\ntested our strategy on a sample of fMRI studies in social neuroscience. We\nfirst report our efforts to generate a representative candidate set of\nreplication targets. We then explore the feasibility and reliability of\nestimating replication value for the targets in our set, resulting in a dataset\nof 1358 studies ranked on their value of prioritising them for replication. In\naddition, we carefully examine possible measures, test auxiliary assumptions,\nand identify boundary conditions of measuring value and uncertainty. We end our\nreport by discussing how future validation studies might be designed. Our study\ndemonstrates the importance of investigating how to implement study selection\nstrategies in practice.

Methodologists have proposed a variety\nof statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is\nnot clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here,\nwe present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of\nthe most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might\nrealistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several\nlevels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity,\nand used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature.

We give exact theoretical results showing\nhow selection for significance affects the distribution of statistical power in\na heterogeneous population of significance tests.

The p-uniform\nand p-curve methods performed well with a fixed effects size and varying sample\nsizes. However, when there was substantial variability in effect sizes as well\nas sample sizes, both methods systematically overestimate mean power. With\nheterogeneity in effect sizes, the maximum likelihood model produced the most\naccurate estimates when the distribution of effect sizes matched the\nassumptions of the model, but z-curve produced more accurate estimates when the\nassumptions of the maximum likelihood model were not met.

The properties of\np-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of\nthese simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be\nused as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a\ncertain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually\ndemonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous\nmathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined\nwithout simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any\nstatistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough\nevaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions\np-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition,\nwe used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of\npublication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence\nthe shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than\n1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also\nsuggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an\narticle as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level.\nThis gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of\nreal effects even when no such effects are actually present.

What is fair to say is that\nstatisticians failed to engage with an incredibly important topic (test for\npublication bias) that addressed a clear need in many scientific communities,\nas most of the criticism was by psychological methodologists. I fully agree\nthat statisticians should have engaged more with this technique. I believe the\nreason that they didn\u2019t is because there is a real problem in the reward\nstructure in statistics, where statisticians get greater rewards inside their\nfield by proposing a 12<sup>th</sup> approach to compute confidence intervals\naround a non-parametric effect size estimate for a test that no one uses, than\nto help psychologists solve a problem they really need a solution for. Indeed,\nfor a statistician, publication bias is a very messy business, and there will\nnever be a sufficiently rigorous test for publication bias to get credit from\nfellow statisticians. There are no beautiful mathematical solutions, no\ncreative insights, there is only the messy reality of a literature that is\nbiased by human actions that we can never adequately capture in a model. The\nfact that empirical researchers often don\u2019t know where to begin to evaluate the\nreliability of claims in their publication-bias-ridden field is not something\nstatisticians care about.

Scrutiny is important, but we can\u2019t know how extensively methods\nshould be vetted, we don\u2019t know how to identify experts, everyone \u2013 including \u2018experts\u2019\n\u2013 is fallible. It is na\u00efve to think \u2018expert vetting\u2019 will lead to clear answers\nabout the methods we should use, and should not use. If we can\u2019t even reach\nagreement about the use of p-values, no one should believe we will ever reach\nagreement about the use of methods to detect publication bias, which will\nalways be messy at best. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I like my\nscience free from authority arguments. Everyone should do their best to\ncriticize everyone else, and if they are able, themselves. Some people will be\nin a better position to criticize some papers than others, but it is difficult\nto predict where the most fatal criticism will come from. Treating statistics\npapers published in a statistics journal as superior to papers in a psychology\njournal is too messy to be a good idea, and boil down to a form of elitism that\nI can\u2019t condone. Sometimes even a lowly 20% statistician can point out flaws in\nmethods proposed by card-carrying statisticians. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">What we can\ndo better is implementing actual quality control.

Morey and Davis-Stober point out the limitations of simulation-based\ntests of a method and convincingly argue for the value of evaluating the\nmathematical properties of a testing procedure. If as a field we agree that an\nevaluation of the mathematical properties of a test is desirable, we should\ntrack whether this evaluation has been performed, or not. We could have a long\nchecklist of desirable quality control standards \u2013 e.g., a method has been\ntested on real datasets, it has been compared to similar methods, those\ncomparisons have been performed objectively based on a well-justified set of\ncriteria, etc. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One could\ncreate a database where for each method the quality standards that have been\nmet and that have not been met are listed. If considered useful, the database\ncould also track how often a method is used, by tracking citations, and listing\npapers that have implemented the method (as opposed to those merely discussing\nthe method). When statistical methods become widely used, the database would point\nresearchers to which methods deserve more scrutiny. The case of magnitude-based\ninference in sport science reveals the importance of a public call for scrutiny\nwhen a method becomes widely popular, especially when this popularity is\nlimited to a single field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The more\ncomplex methods are, the more limitations they have. This will be true for all\nmethods that aim to deal with publication bias, because the way scientists bias\nthe literature is difficult to quantify. Maybe as a field we will come to agree\nthat tests for bias are never accurate enough, and we will recommend people to\njust look at the distribution of p-values without performing a test. Alternatively,\nwe might believe that it is useful to have a testing procedure that too often\nsuggests a literature contains at least some non-zero effects, because we feel\nwe need some way to intersubjectively point out that there is bias in a\nliterature, even if this is based on an imperfect test. Such discussions\nrequire a wide range of stakeholders, and the opinion of statisticians about\nthe statistical properties of a test is only one source of input in this\ndiscussion. Imperfect procedures are implemented all the time, if they are the\nbest we have, and doing nothing is also not working. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Statistical\nmethods are rarely perfect from their inception, and all have limitations. Although\nI understand the feeling, banning all tests that have not been adequately vetted\nby an expert is inherently unscientific. Such a suggestion would destroy the\nvery core of science \u2013 an institution that promotes mutual criticism, while\naccepting our fallibility.

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

    "title": "Effect of an auditory static distractor on the perception of an auditory moving target",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.25119v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: It is known that listeners lose the ability to discriminate the direction of motion of a revolving sound (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) beyond a critical velocity (\"the upper limit\"), primarily due to degraded front-back discrimination. Little is known about how this ability is affected by simultaneously present distractor sounds, despite the real-life importance of tracking moving sounds in the presence of distractors. We hypothesized that the presence of a static distractor sound would impair the perception of moving target sounds and reduce the upper limit, and show that this is indeed the case. A distractor on the right was as effective as a distractor at the front in reducing the upper limit despite the importance of resolving front-back confusions. By manipulating the spectral content of both the target and distractor, we found that the upper limit was reduced if and only if the distractor spectrally overlaps with the target in the frequency range relevant for front/back discrimination; energetic masking thus explains the upper limit reduction by the distractor. We did not find any evidence for informational masking by the distractor. Our findings form the first steps towards a better understanding of the tracking of multiple sounds in the presence of distractors.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for seizures after new-onset refractory status epilepticus: a case report",
    "content": "ObjectivesMost patients with new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) subsequently develop drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) with multiple seizure foci and are not the typical candidates for resective surgery. We report the first case of DRE developing after cryptogenic-NORSE (C-NORSE) that was successfully treated using deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS).MethodsA 52-year-old man developed C-NORSE at the age of 45\u2009years and presented with sequelae of DRE and cognitive dysfunction despite anti-seizure medications and immunotherapy administration. Seizure semiology comprised palpitations, chills, and nausea, followed by impairment of awareness with oral automatism multiple times a day. Video-electroencephalogram monitoring (vEEG) showed bilateral independent electrographic seizures (ESz) in the fronto-temporal areas. He underwent ANT-DBS. Preoperative and postoperative vEEG recordings for 3\u2009days were compared.ResultsPreoperative vEEG showed 11 clinical seizures correlated with ESz. The duration of ESz ranged from 55 to 213\u2009s (median, 81\u2009s). Three months after ANT-DBS stimulation, vEEG showed four subclinical ESz episodes lasting from 22 to 31\u2009s (median, 25.5\u2009s) (Mann\u2013Whitney U test, p\u2009=\u20090.001). The patient had not developed an overt clinical seizure until the last follow-up at 9\u2009months. No adverse events were observed during treatment.ConclusionANT-DBS is an effective treatment option for DRE after NORSE, particularly when the epileptogenic network is located in the temporal lobe. A detailed evaluation using vEEG is useful for identifying the epileptogenic foci and assessing therapeutic outcome. Immunomodulatory mechanisms via cytokines could play roles in the pathogenesis of development of DRE after NORSE and seizure suppression effect of ANT-DBS.",

    "title": "The trade-off between maximizing reconstruction and physiological interpretation of muscle synergies with autoencoders",
    "content": "IntroductionIn neuroscience, the muscle synergy method is a widely known computational approach for studying motor control from electromyographic (EMG) recordings. Standard algorithms for synergy extraction rely on a linearity assumption for synergy combination. However, the interactions between muscle groups and movement dynamics often exhibit non-linear characteristics, suggesting the need for alternative approaches. In this context, autoencoders (AEs) have been proposed as promising tools. However, previous studies focused on the reconstruction accuracy optimization and not on the structure of the synergies, and the influence of AE design parameters has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to explore the impact of different activation functions on the effectiveness of AEs.MethodsTo this end, we used a rich dataset of upper-limb EMG signals recorded from 16 muscles in 15 participants performing reaching movements toward 9 targets across 5 planes. We evaluated the effects of combining four activation functions in the encoder and decoder layers\u2014linear, ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh\u2014and compared to standard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).ResultsOur findings show that the extracted synergies are highly sensitive to the AE architecture. Notably, the configurations obtaining the best signal reconstruction do not correspond to the most physiologically meaningful synergies, which were instead achieved with the ReLU+tanh configuration.DiscussionThis suggests that optimizing reconstruction accuracy may result in non-interpretable synergy structures. This research emphasizes the role of non-linear techniques in extracting muscle synergy from different datasets (e.g., lower limbs, full-body movements, patient populations) and identifies the optimal combination of transfer functions for the encoder and decoder layers.",

    "title": "Exploring gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson\u2019s disease: insights from a 16S amplicon sequencing Eastern European pilot study",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder increasingly associated with alterations in gut microbiota through the gut\u2013brain axis (GBA). Despite growing global interest, studies examining microbiota composition in Eastern European populations remain limited.MethodsWe profiled the gut microbiota of 59 Romanian individuals using 16S rRNA gene sequencing targeting the V3\u2013V4 region. After quality filtering, 39 subjects (19 PD patients and 20 healthy controls [HC]) were retained for downstream analysis. Clinical metadata were collected to assess potential confounders, including age, sex, metabolic parameters, lifestyle, and comorbidities.ResultsPD patients differed significantly from HCs in glycemia (p = 0.02), cholesterol (p = 0.027), and LDL levels (p = 0.047), and more frequently presented with restrictive diets and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. While \u03b1-diversity metrics did not differ significantly between groups, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Aitchison distance showed moderate compositional separation. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) confirmed that disease status was a significant driver of gut microbiota composition (R2 = 5.3%, p = 0.002), independent of clinical and lifestyle covariates. Sparse partial least square linear discriminant (sPLS-DA) identified several genera distinguishing PD from HC, with Mogibacterium and RikenellaceaeRC9 gut group enriched in PD, and several known short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing genera (Fusicatenibacter, Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, Butyricicoccus, Anaerostipes) enriched in HCs. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) corroborated these findings, confirming the differential abundance of several SCFA-producing genera in the HC group.DiscussionOur results reveal distinct microbial signatures associated with PD in this Romanian cohort, marked by a consistent depletion of SCFA-producing bacteria in patients. These findings support the role of gut microbiota in PD pathophysiology and underscore the need for further studies in Eastern European populations.",

    "title": "Engineered spermidine-secreting Saccharomyces boulardii enhances olfactory memory in Drosophila melanogaster",
    "content": "IntroductionThe polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are ubiquitous metabolites synthesized in all cells. The intracellular levels of polyamines, especially spermidine, decrease in aging. Oral spermidine supplementation has been reported to alleviate aspects of aging-related disease in animal models, including decline in learning and memory. The diverse health benefits of spermidine supplementation, often at doses that do not significantly alter spermidine levels of target organs, suggests that exogenous spermidine may have a common site of action, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.MethodsTo directly deliver spermidine to the GI tract with minimum impact on the global spermidine levels, we engineered the probiotic yeast Sacchromyces boulardii (Sb) to overproduce and secrete spermidine. We tested the effects of a spermidine-producing yeast strain (Sb576) on aging-associated learning and memory decline in an olfactory classical conditioning assay in Drosophila melanogaster.ResultsFeeding of newly eclosed flies of the wild-type (w1118) strain for 30 days with food supplemented with live Sb576, but not live wild-type Sb (SbWT) or free spermidine, reduced aging-associated short-term memory (STM) decline. Notably, Sb576 supplementation, but not SbWT or spermidine supplementation, of either young flies or old flies for only three days also enhanced STM without affecting locomotive ability. Furthermore, we showed that Sb576 supplementation also significantly reduced aging-associated STM decline in Dh31R, a mutant strain lacking the diuretic hormone 31 receptor, which exhibits compromised learning and memory.ConclusionThese results demonstrate that in situ production of spermidine by a synthetic biotic yeast in the GI tract can enhance STM and further suggest a mechanism involving the gut-brain axis.",

    "title": "Exploring the 31P chemical shift behavior of high-energy phosphates at 7 T in patients with glioma",
    "content": "IntroductionThe characterization of tumor microenvironment in vivo can be supported by 31P MRSI, a non-invasive technique that enables the determination of intracellular pH and magnesium ion concentration, among other parameters. However, it remains unclear from recent studies whether imaging biomarkers, like the intracellular pH value (as determined conventionally via the chemical shift separation between inorganic phosphate (Pi) and phosphocreatine), are correlated with different glioma subtypes. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the behavior of multiple chemical shifts, specifically those of Pi and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to approach a more detailed characterization of glioma tissues.MethodsA retrospective analysis on 31P MRSI datasets from 11 patients with newly diagnosed glioma acquired at 7 T prior to any treatment was conducted. Mean values of the quantified chemical shifts of Pi, \u03b3-, \u03b1- and \u03b2-ATP across different regions-of-interest were determined for each patient separately. The mean chemical shifts were compared for different tumor sub-compartments and for different IDH mutation status.ResultsIn high-grade gliomas, significant differences in chemical shifts were observed between tumor and healthy tissue. In low-grade glioma, smaller differences were found for the chemical shifts of Pi, \u03b3- and \u03b1-ATP than in the high-grade glioma. The latter pattern was not observed for \u03b2-ATP resonances, where the mean chemical shift across the tumor was comparably high between low-grade and high-grade glioma. In patients with IDH-wildtype, slightly stronger shifts of Pi and \u03b3-ATP peaks were observed than for patients with IDH-mutant. No differences between IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant were observed for the chemical shifts of \u03b1- and \u03b2-ATP.DiscussionThese findings suggest a potential benefit of a joint evaluation of Pi and ATP chemical shifts for possible discrimination of different glioma subtypes. Using the complementary information of multiple 31P chemical shifts could improve the characterization of tumor tissue and provide new insights beyond current knowledge.",

    "title": "Multiphoton microscopy imaging of fibrous meningiomas based on the combination of multichannel mode and lambda mode",
    "content": "Fibrous meningiomas, known for their dense and tough texture, present unique challenges in diagnosis and surgical treatment. This study explores the potential of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for visualizing the microstructures of fibrous meningiomas by combining multichannel and lambda modes. Using MPM, we imaged 14 fibrous meningioma samples collected from neurosurgical procedures. The multichannel mode captured second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) signals, while the lambda mode provided detailed spectral imaging across 32 channels. Image analysis algorithms were developed to quantify collagen content and assess morphological features. Spectroscopic analysis revealed the intrinsic components of fibrous meningiomas, with collagen being the most abundant component (relative ratio: 0.952), followed by structural proteins (0.502), free-form NADH (0.393), FAD (0.199), lipopigments (0.198), protein-bound NADH (0.105), porphyrin derivatives I (0.104), and porphyrin derivatives II (0.015). The combined spectral images also provided high-contrast and high-resolution views of the tumor microenvironment. Quantitative analysis showed that the average collagen content in fibrous meningioma tissues was 0.537\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.131 using SHG imaging and 0.503\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.133 using combined 32-channel spectral imaging. With the advancement of fiber optic technology and multiphoton endoscopy, multiphoton microscopy holds promise as a new technology for clinically diagnosing fibrous meningiomas.",

    "content": "IntroductionAdrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare X-linked neurogenetic disease caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) gene. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and severity of ALD remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify information on candidate genes associated with the onset and severity of ALD by transcriptome sequencing of whole blood samples from monozygotic twin families with the disease.MethodsThe identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), set theory analysis, gene enrichment analysis, and classification statistics of expression trends have been executed to acquire potential candidate genes inducing the onset and severity of ALD in patients. The study cohort comprised eight individuals: two normal children, two pediatric twins with ALD, the twins\u2019 mother, their adult uncle with ALD, the twins\u2019grandmother, and one normal adult.ResultsFive distinct sets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using whole blood samples from a family of identical twins with different onset ages and ABCD1 exon 2 deletions. Then, 39 DEGs of A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2212 D and A \u2229 B \u2212 D, as well as 425 DEGs of C \u2229 E, were considered as genes relating to the onset and severity of ALD. In particular, C4BPA, TPBG, CEP112, CHST15, SMAD1, IL-26, and LRRC69 have shown more importance than others in ALD onset. Furthermore, KEGG and GO enrichment further suggested the role of Ca2+ homeostasis and the plasma membrane in ALD onset and severity. Finally, expression pattern analysis further demonstrated the pivotal role of the selected DEG sets.DiscussionThe information on candidate genes of this study was considered crucial for preliminarily exploring the molecular mechanisms related to the onset and severity of ALD, which offered novel insights and research directions for mitigating and treating the development of ALD.",
