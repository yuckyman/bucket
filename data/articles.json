    "title": "The Intermediate Hippocampus Integrates Shock-Observation and Spatial Information during Observational Fear Memory",
    "content": "In the wild, learning about danger, not from one's own direct experience, but by observing the experiences of others is a crucial adaptive strategy for avoiding life-threatening situations. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that rodents can acquire fear vicariously by witnessing conspecifics in distress. The hippocampus, organized in functionally distinct sub-domains along its septotemporal axis, and critical for the formation and consolidation of memories, has recently been shown to be necessary for contextual vicarious fear learning in rodents. However, the neuronal mechanisms by which hippocampal circuits map others' distress onto an observer's own spatial representations remain poorly understood. To address this question, we recorded single-unit activity from the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral hippocampus of observer rats engaged in a vicarious fear-learning task. In this paradigm, animals learn to fear a shock context in which they witness a conspecific receive electrical footshocks, but not a safe context in which the same conspecific was present in a neutral state. We show that: 1) neurons both from the dorsal and intermediate hippocampus conjunctively encode witnessing a shock delivered to a conspecific and the place where it was observed, although shock observation recruited a larger proportion of pyramidal neurons within the intermediate hippocampus, 2) during a subsequent rest, the patterns of spiking activity associated with the shock context were preferentially reactivated, particularly in the intermediate hippocampus and 3) while spatial representations corresponding to both the safe and shock context reorganized in nearly all subregion of the hippocampus following shock observation, we found a relative stabilization of the spatial representation associated with the shock context for pyramidal cells recorded from the intermediate hippocampus. Our results reveal multiple neuronal mechanisms by which hippocampal neurons, particularly within the intermediate subregions, encode and consolidate vicarious fear memories.",

    "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
    "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

    "title": "Extinction and reinstatement sex-dependently affect freezing behavior, pain perception, locomotion, and rearing behavior in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
    "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

    "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks). As is usual in oddball paradigms, the P3b was much larger for trials in the rare category than for trials in the frequent category (see Figure 2).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1256\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/89260e9e-be6e-48b1-adc4-58b77a418deb/Figure_3.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1996\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 3</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">The main question was whether the location of the dot was encoded in working memory better for the oddball trials than for the standard trials. To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "Conditioned place preferences for virtual reality cannabis cues.",
    "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

    "content": "Environmental threats are typically encountered when animals are searching for food and other necessities. Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

    "title": "Patterns of prefrontal cortical activity associated with attention-demanding and motor aspects of dual-task walking as measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy.",
    "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

I've been working on a focused library called <strong>calgebra</strong> that applies set operations to calendars.</p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>calgebra lets you compose calendar timelines using set operators: <code>|</code> (union), <code>&amp;</code> (intersection), <code>-</code> (difference), and <code>~</code> (complement). Queries are lazy\u2014you build expressions first, then execute via slicing.</p> <p><strong>Example \u2013 find when a team is free for a 2+ hour meeting:</strong></p> <p>```python from calgebra import day_of_week, time_of_day, hours, HOUR</p> <h1>Define business hours</h1> <p>weekend = day_of_week([&quot;saturday&quot;, &quot;sunday&quot;], tz=&quot;US/Pacific&quot;) weekdays = ~weekend business_hours = weekdays &amp; time_of_day(start=9<em>HOUR, duration=8</em>HOUR, tz=&quot;US/Pacific&quot;)</p> <h1>Team calendars (Google Calendar, .ics files, etc.)</h1> <p>team_busy = alice | bob | charlie</p> <h1>One expression to find available slots</h1> <p>free_slots = (business_hours - team_busy) &amp; (hours &gt;= 2) ```</p> <p><strong>Features:</strong> - Set operations on timelines (union, intersection, difference, complement) - Lazy composition \u2013 build complex queries, execute via slicing - Recurring patterns with RFC 5545 support - Filter by duration, metadata, or custom properties - Google Calendar read/write integration - iCalendar (.ics) import/export</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Developers building scheduling features, calendar integrations, or availability analysis. Also well-suited for AI/coding agents as the composable, type-hinted API works nicely as a tool.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>Most calendar libraries focus on parsing (icalendar, ics.py) or API access (gcsa, google-api-python-client). calgebra is about <em>composing</em> calendars algebraically:</p> <ul> <li><strong>icalendar / ics.py</strong>: Parse .ics files \u2192 calgebra can <em>import</em> from these, then let you query and combine them</li> <li><strong>gcsa</strong>: Google Calendar CRUD \u2192 calgebra wraps gcsa and adds set operations on top</li> <li><strong>dateutil.rrule</strong>: Generate recurrences \u2192 calgebra uses this internally but exposes timelines you can intersect/subtract</li> </ul> <p>The closest analog is SQL for time ranges, but expressed as Python operators.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> - GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/ashenfad/calgebra\">https://github.com/ashenfad/calgebra</a> - Video of a calgebra enabled agent: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/10kG4tw0D4k\">https://youtu.be/10kG4tw0D4k</a></p> <p>Would love feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impressive-Glass-523\"> /u/Impressive-Glass-523 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q2gkde/i_built_calgebra_set_algebra_for_calendars_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q2gkde/i_built_calgebra_set_algebra_for_calendars_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
    "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

    "title": "Improved filter bank common spatial pattern algorithm based on the sparrow search algorithm",
    "content": "IntroductionThe application of motor imagery in human\u2013computer interaction and rehabilitative medicine has attracted growing attention due to recent advances in brain\u2013computer interface technologies. However, traditional EEG decoding paradigms based on fixed frequency\u2013band segmentation often exhibit limited performance because they fail to capture individual variability in brain rhythms.MethodsThis work proposes an adaptive method that integrates the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to optimize sub\u2013band segmentation for motor imagery EEG decoding. SSA adaptively searches for optimal sub\u2013band boundaries, enabling individualized frequency\u2013band selection.ResultsExperiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset under a cross\u2013session evaluation protocol (training on session T, testing on session E) demonstrated that SSA\u2013FBCSP effectively improves frequency\u2013band adaptability. The SSA\u2013FBCSP approach was further combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k\u2013Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers to evaluate the influence of different downstream classifiers.ConclusionAmong them, SSA\u2013FBCSP\u2013LDA achieved the best performance, outperforming the conventional uniform sub\u2013band approach by 21.76% and reaching an average accuracy of 89.92%. The adaptively selected sub\u2013bands closely matched the ERD/ERS distribution, confirming the method\u2019s effectiveness in frequency\u2013band optimization. Compared with recent deep\u2013learning\u2013based MI\u2013EEG models, the proposed technique offers a balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, providing a promising direction for personalized brain\u2013computer interface systems.",

    "content": "BackgroundDeep brain stimulation (DBS) significantly improves tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but gait and speech remain inconsistent. These discrepancies underscore the need for a systematic, quantitative synthesis of existing data to clarify the impact of DBS across different motor domains.ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate the effects of DBS on motor symptoms in PD by analyzing UPDRS-III scores and conducting subgroup analyses based on stimulation target, stimulation type, and medication status.MethodsA literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies on clinical trials and observational studies reporting pre- and post-DBS motor assessments in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science from inception to 15 December 2024.ResultsA total of 35 studies comprising 1,082 PD patients were included. The pooled analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall UPDRS-III scores post-DBS (WMD: = \u22121.09, 95% CI: \u22121.32 to \u22120.87, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Subgroup analyses showed consistent improvements across tremor, rigidity, akinesia, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and axial symptoms, regardless of stimulation target or medication state. UPDRS Part IV scores also significantly improved, reflecting reduced motor complications. However, speech function remained unchanged, and UPDRS Part I scores initially showed no significant improvement, though significance emerged after removing sources of heterogeneity.ConclusionDBS significantly improves overall motor function, particularly tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, its effects on gait and speech remain inconsistent, which shows the need for further research to refine patient selection and optimize stimulation parameters. These findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic impact of DBS in PD management.",

    "title": "Skull stripping tools in pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans: a retrospective evaluation of segmentation performance",
    "content": "IntroductionFor brain maturity assessment of infants aged above 6 months, T2-weighted MRI scans are recommended. Prior to automated brain tissue analysis, skull stripping is typically applied. However, most skull stripping tools neither focus on T2-weighted scans nor on pediatric cohorts. Here, we present the evaluation results of seven common skull stripping tools in a comparably large pediatric cohort.MethodsThis study is based on 199 T2-weighted scans of children under the age of 5 years retrospectively acquired from the clinical routine at Hannover Medical School. We established a manually labeled ground truth under quality control of a senior neuroradiologist specialized in pediatric neuroradiology and evaluated seven skull stripping tools (BET, ROBEX, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast, SynthStrip, SynthStrip-noCSF and d-SynthStrip). Segmentation performance (Dice score, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, sensitivity, specificity) and computation time were assessed on non-preprocessed and preprocessed scans (zero padding, contrast enhancement, artifact removal and normalization) as well as in different brain regions. For the best performing model, we manually assessed the top and bottom quartile of segmentations with respect to the integrity of different anatomical brain structures.ResultsOnly BET, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast profited from data preprocessing. Considering this, all models had median Dice scores between 0.88 and 0.96, with SynthStrip performing best. All models segmented most accurately in the middle axial slices of the brain. Resampling lowered the performance of all models, except ROBEX. Mean computing times ranged from 2\u202fs (BET) to 132\u202fs (HD-BET) with SynthStrip requiring 7\u202fs. per scan. SynthStrip was prone to not entirely including the Sinus sagittalis superior, the upper Cerebrum, the temporal pole, the Cerebellum and the Chiasma opticum/pituitary gland. In contrast, the petrous bone and the skull in the middle axial slices have often been partly included.DiscussionDue to its robustness and quick computation time, we recommend SynthStrip for skull stripping of pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans. We attribute the observed segmentation errors to the partial volume effect, which should be addressed in future research. Limitations of our study include the monocentric setting, the exclusion of pathological cases and the skewed age distribution in our cohort.",

    "content": "IntroductionIn this study, we propose a data-driven approach that integrates behavioral diagnosis with neuroimaging features to identify representative UWS and MCS patients from a large inpatient cohort.MethodsClinical information was extracted using a subset of UWS patients with CRS-R scores \u2264 5. Neuroimaging biomarkers were established as the increased and decreased functional connectivity indices of anatomically defined regions covering the whole brain. The algorithm was implemented through an iterative refinement process that converged on a division of UWS and MCS patients into representative and excluded (or nonrepresentative) patient groups.ResultsThirty-one out of 58 UWS patients and 23 out of 30 MCS patients were identified as representative, with an average classification accuracy of 90.2% in differentiating between the two groups. In contrast, differentiating between excluded UWS patients (n =\u202f27) and representative MCS patients (n =\u202f23) and between all UWS (n =\u202f58) and MCS (n =\u202f30) patients produced average classification accuracies of 50.9 and 64.3%, respectively. Furthermore, altered DMN functional connectivity between representative UWS and MCS patients revealed a consistent pattern as shown in prior studies, while comparisons involving excluded patients did not.DiscussionThese results highlight the value of integrating behavioral scores and neural connectivity features for DOC classification, providing a more coherent basis for downstream analysis and machine-learning applications in DOC classification.",

    "title": "Integrated auditory-vocal embodied training for expressive authentic intonation in Chinese zither performance",
    "content": "BackgroundChinese zither music relies on culturally specific microtones (e. g., FA+ and TI\u2013) that differ from Western equal temperament, yet prolonged exposure to standardized tuning often leads to the erosion of these traditional intonation practices. While embodied cognition theory emphasizes the role of sensorimotor integration in learning, its application to the acquisition of non-fixed pitch systems in intangible cultural heritage music remains underexplored.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether a structured auditory-vocal embodied training protocol\u2014integrating listening, vocal imitation, and metaphoric gestures\u2014could enhance zither learners' accuracy in producing traditional microtones, and to provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of embodied cognition theory in sustaining culturally authentic musical intonation.MethodsA quasi-experimental design was employed with 63 intermediate-level zither students. Participants were assigned to an experimental group, which completed a 1-week auditory-vocal-gestural training program, or a control group, which continued regular practice without multimodal integration. Pitch accuracy on two critical tones (FA+ and TI\u2013) was assessed through pre- and post-tests.ResultsThe experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Chinese-style pitch accuracy compared to the control group, along with a marked shift in intonation perception away from equal-tempered biases.ConclusionThe findings indicate that multisensory embodied training, grounded in the principles of perceptual-motor coupling and gestural simulation, effectively promotes the internalization of traditional microtonal intonation. This study not only offers a novel pedagogical approach for preserving intangible cultural heritage in music education but also substantiates the role of embodied cognition in acquiring culturally situated sensorimotor skills.",

    "content": "Moderate-volume brainstem hemorrhage (>5 mL) typically carries an extremely poor prognosis. This article presents a rare case of survival following a large-volume brainstem hemorrhage with therapeutic intervention. A 47-year-old male with hypertension presented with sudden-onset coma. CT imaging revealed a 10.3 mL brainstem hemorrhage. The patient underwent hematoma puncture drainage and tracheostomy, accompanied by hemostatic therapy, intracranial pressure reduction, anti-infection treatment, and neurorehabilitation. During treatment, the patient developed recurrent multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. After 2 months, the patient gradually regained consciousness with improved limb muscle strength, though exhibiting motor aphasia, dysphagia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Rehabilitation therapy was continued. This case demonstrates that even with large-volume brainstem hemorrhage, comprehensive management including timely drainage, intracranial pressure control, tracheostomy, infection management, and early rehabilitation may achieve survival and consciousness recovery. However, as a single-case report, this study has limited sample size, necessitating further large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings.",

    "title": "D1R-specific modulation of ACC mitigates chronic neuropathic pain",
    "content": "Maladaptive plasticity within central pain circuits is a defining feature of chronic neuropathic pain, yet the mechanisms governing these changes remain unclear. This study investigates the role of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway in the neuropathic pain-induced hyperexcitability of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing anterior cingulate cortex (ACCD1R) neurons. We find that infusing D1R agonists in the ACC reverses the mechanical hypersensitivity and negative affective-motivational affect in mice caused by spared-nerve injury (SNI). Although ACC pyramidal neurons are widely presumed to be the principal targets of D1R signaling, ex vivo recordings reveal that D1R agonists suppress the excitability of D1R-expressing pyramidal neurons while enhancing the excitability of D1R-expressing interneurons. Consistently, gene-expression analyses show that D1R-expression is distributed across both excitatory and inhibitory ACC neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the excitability of genetically labeled D1R pyramidal neurons is enhanced by SNI, whereas in interneurons, it is reduced. Chemogenetic manipulation demonstrates that activation of D1R neurons produces robust analgesic and anxiolytic effects, whereas inhibition worsens pain- and anxiety-related behaviours, indicating that inhibitory D1R neurons dominate population-level output. Circuit tracing further delineates diverse afferent and efferent connections linking ACCD1R neurons to sensory and affective pain pathways. Together, these results identify dopaminergic regulation of ACCD1R neurons as a critical determinant of cortical dysfunction in chronic pain.",

    "title": "Microglia stabilize sleep homeostasis via adenosine A3 receptor signaling",
    "content": "Sleep homeostasis maintains the sleep-wake balance through sleep pressure, a process orchestrated by the accumulation of extracellular adenosine (eADO). Microglial Ca2+ activity has been implicated in sleep regulation, but the mechanism whereby microglia sense sleep pressure remains unclear. Here we show that microglia regulate sleep homeostasis through brain state-dependent Ca2+ activity driven by adenosine A3 receptor (A3R) signaling. Using miniaturized two-photon microscopy (mTPM) in freely behaving mice, we demonstrate that microglial Ca2+ activity is rapidly altered by brain-state transitions. Pharmacological experiments reveal that microglial Ca2+ dynamics are predominantly mediated by A3R in response to brain state-dependent eADO oscillations. Microglia-specific deletion of A3R attenuates these state-dependent Ca2+ dynamics, impairs microglial morphological plasticity across sleep-wake cycles, and leads to sleep fragmentation by increasing transitions between wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Together, these findings establish that microglia regulate sleep homeostasis by stabilizing both wakefulness and NREM sleep, a process critically dependent on eADO-A3R signaling.",

    "title": "Building neuroanatomical resources for three-spined sticklebacks: Brain areas important for social behavior",
    "content": "Introduction: Three-spined stickleback fish are famous for their diversity and charismatic social behavior. However, there are few neuroanatomical resources for studying the neural and brain mechanisms underlying their fascinating behavior. Methods and Results: We identify 11 brain areas important for social behavior by referencing brain atlases for six other teleost fishes. Brain regions were identified via neuroanatomical landmarks and we characterized the presence / absence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key gene product of the dopaminergic system, in those regions. Comparing the neuroanatomical location of these regions in the stickleback brain and the expression of TH therein to that of other fish species highlights similarities and differences and the need for a brain atlas specific to sticklebacks. This resource serves as a map of the location of regions important for social behavior in the stickleback brain. Conclusion: This resource will help guide future studies connecting gene function to social behavior through the brain and will enable future work to understand the evolution of neural mechanisms that contribute to the diversity of social behavior in this emerging model organism.",

    "content": "Sleep is essential for health and light is an important environmental signal influencing its timing, quality, and regulation. Retinal light exposure reflects the interplay between environmental illumination and behavioral choices, yet it remains unclear which habitual light exposure-related behaviors meaningfully impact sleep outcomes. In this preregistered analysis, we examined associations between these behaviors, sleep timing, and sleep complaints in a large, international community sample (N = 774, mean age = 32.6 {+/-} 14.6 years). Participants completed the Light Exposure Behavior Assessment (LEBA), with four behavioral domains included in the analyses. Sleep timing, sleep disturbances and sleep-related daytime impairment were measured using established questionnaires. Bayesian analyses indicated that time spent outdoors and device use in bed were most strongly associated with sleep outcomes. Greater time outdoors was linked to earlier sleep timing and fewer sleep complaints, whereas more frequent device use in bed was associated with greater sleep disturbance and daytime impairment. Morning and daytime lighting practices and evening light control showed no conclusive evidence. Together, these findings highlight the relevance of everyday light exposure-related behaviors for sleep and support behavioral approaches to promoting healthy sleep in real-world contexts.",

    "title": "A prelimbic molecular clock of protein synthesis for memory persistence",
    "content": "Emotionally salient associative memories can endure for long periods, yet the mechanisms that determine their long-term stability remain unclear. Here we show that the prelimbic (PL) cortex integrates temporally structured translational programs to control both the consolidation and reconsolidation of cued threat memories. Using Pavlovian threat conditioning with in vivo fiber photometry, we found that PL calcium dynamics tightly track memory strength: discrete threat-predictive cues evoked robust activity during recent and single-timepoint remote retrieval, whereas prior retrieval selectively weakened remote expression, independent of contextual influences. Translational profiling of PL Camk2a cells uncovered a biphasic consolidation program, with an early phase characterized by ER stress-linked translational repression and robust oligodendrocyte plasticity, followed by a delayed phase engaging synaptic growth pathways. Loss- and gain-of-function approaches demonstrated that eIF2-regulated, cap-independent translation is essential for recent consolidation and for the enduring stabilization of remote memory, whereas retrieval-induced destabilization engages a mechanistically distinct, eIF4E-dependent translational pathway required for reconsolidation. These findings identify the PL cortex as a dynamic node in which discrete modes of translational control govern the long-term persistence of emotional memories.",

    "title": "Dlx2 reprograms the transcriptome and laminar position of glia-derivedAscl1-induced interneurons",
    "content": "Direct lineage reprogramming of glial cells into neurons offers a promising strategy to repair diseased brain circuits, but engineering defined neuronal subtypes remains challenging. We found that a phospho-site-deficient Ascl1 variant, Ascl1SA6, but not wildtype Ascl1, induces hallmarks of parvalbumin fast-spiking interneurons, raising the question of how closely these induced neurons resemble canonical cortical interneurons and what transcriptional events underlie this process. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ascl1SA6-induced neurons only partially recapitulated canonical interneuron programs and failed to induce the transcription factor Dlx2 and its downstream targets. Co-expression of Dlx2 with Ascl1SA6 restored a more canonical interneuron-like transcriptome, including genes involved in migration, and resulted in neurons occupying laminar positions more typical of endogenous interneurons. These findings provide molecular insights into how Ascl1 posttranslational modifications regulate its transcriptional activity and demonstrate a strategy to engineer induced cortical interneurons that more closely resemble their native counterparts, offering a framework for layer-specific restoration of inhibitory circuits in neurological diseases.",

    "content": "Enhancement of neuronal plasticity is a key determinant of the onset of antidepressant responses. Because brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent synaptic plasticity is essential for antidepressant efficacy, we examined whether fast-acting antidepressants directly trigger BDNF release. At antidepressant-relevant concentrations, ketamine and its metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) induced BDNF secretion from mossy fiber terminals of granule neurons within minutes of application in rat hippocampal cultures. BDNF release required selective NMDAR signaling, as conditional genetic deletion of presynaptic NMDARs from granule neurons or from postsynaptic NMDARs from CA3 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, abolished BDNF exocytosis in response to both ketamine and HNK or selectively to HNK, respectively. Both compounds produced acute synaptic plasticity, reflected by gains and losses of CA3 dendritic spines without a net change in overall spine density. These findings reveal distinct, drug-specific NMDAR mechanisms at mossy fiber terminal-CA3 synapses that drive rapid BDNF release by fast-acting antidepressants.",

    "title": "Fidelity of Spatiotemporal Patterns of Brain Activity Across Sampling Rate, Scan Duration, and Frequency Content",
    "content": "Intrinsic brain activity is characterized by large-scale spatiotemporal patterns that underpin functional connectivity and cognition. Quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) and complex principal component analysis (cPCA) have emerged as reproducible methods for capturing spatiotemporal network interactions in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). However, these methods remain sensitive to methodological factors such as scan duration, repetition time (TR), and frequency band selection. This study systematically evaluates how these parameters influence the stability and reliability of QPP- and cPCA-derived functional connectivity patterns across multiple datasets. Using five independent rs-fMRI datasets, we evaluate the impact of scan length on pattern reliability, explore the effects of TR on spatiotemporal patterns, and compare the sensitivity of different frequency bands (Slow-5, Slow-4, infraslow) in capturing network dynamics. Our findings reveal that while both QPPs and cPCA detect intrinsic network activity, their reliability varies with acquisition parameters. QPPs exhibit greater stability in shorter scans, making them suitable for individual-level analyses, whereas cPCA provides a broader representation of phase-coherent fluctuations but shows greater between-subject variability and benefits more from longer, group-level acquisitions. Additionally, frequency band selection significantly influences the temporal structure of extracted patterns: in our analyses, Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) tended to emphasize more recurrent, synchronized network configurations, whereas Slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) more often revealed transitions between connectivity states. These results provide critical insights into optimizing methodological choices for dynamic functional connectivity analysis, enhancing the interpretability of spatiotemporal patterns in both basic and clinical neuroimaging research.",

    "title": "Spatiotemporally distinctive astrocytic and neuronal responses to repetitive intracortical microstimulation",
    "content": "Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as active modulators of neuronal synaptic transmission. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is widely used to manipulate neuronal activity, yet the accompanying astrocytic responses remain poorly characterized. Using dual-color in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously monitor neurons and astrocytes, we show that ICMS elicits astrocytic activation with spatiotemporal features that diverge from those of neurons. Astrocytes were recruited at stimulation intensities as low as 10A, thresholds sufficient to activate neurons, indicating that astrocytes robustly sense electrical perturbation. Unlike neurons, however, astrocytic responses were spatially heterogeneous and temporally variable across trials. At higher stimulation intensities (>=50A), astrocytic responsiveness, i.e., response peak amplitude, and number of responsive trials, progressively attenuated across repeated trials, in contrast to the stable and consistent neuronal responses. Although neuronally driven, astrocytes exhibited a distinct response profile under the same stimulation parameter, revealing a unique component of electrically evoked cortical activity that underscores the importance of incorporating glial physiology into future neuroprosthetic strategies.",

    "title": "Elliptical speech reveals the use of broad phonetic categories aids noise-degraded speech perception",
    "content": "Purpose: Speech perception requires that listeners classify sensory information into smaller groupings while also coping with noise that often corrupts the speech signal. The strength of categorization and speech-in-noise (SIN) abilities show stark individual differences. Some listeners perceive speech sounds in a gradient fashion, while others categorize in a discrete/binary manner, favoring fine acoustic details vs. a more abstract phonetic code, respectively. Prior work suggests SIN processing is (i) related to more gradient phonetic perception and (ii) varies with musical training. Method: To further probe relations between perceptual gradiency and noise-degraded listening, we measured phoneme categorization, SIN recognition (QuickSIN), and sentence recognition in listeners with varying musical backgrounds. Categorization was measured for vowels and stops using standard labeling tasks. Speech recognition and discrimination were assessed using 'elliptical speech' sentences that use featural substitutions which renders them meaningless under clean conditions but surprisingly improves their recognition under noise degradation. We hypothesized listeners who use broader perceptual equivalency classes in hearing elliptical speech would show better SIN perception, indicative of a more gradient listening strategy. Results: Listeners perceived elliptical sentences as sounding different than their intact counterparts in the clear but as the same under noise degradation. But this elliptical benefit varied with music background. Nonmusicians showed larger susceptibility and noise-related benefit of ellipses than musicians, consistent with the notion they used broader phonetic categories (i.e., more gradient listening). Elliptical speech perception was also associated with QuickSIN performance in both groups but in opposite ways. Conclusions: Use of broader categories was related to better SIN processing in nonmusicians but poorer SIN processing in musicians. Findings suggest listeners can use broader perceptual equivalence classes to deal with degraded listening situations but this depends critically on their auditory demographics. Nonmusicians might use broader phonetic categories to aid SIN perception while musicians might use narrower categories or otherwise similar speech contexts.",

    "title": "A plug-and-play ROI imaging module and deep-learning denoising framework extend three-photon microscopy to 1.7 mm depth",
    "content": "Three-photon microscopy (3PM) has extended optical imaging beyond the reach of two-photon microscopy (2PM), but its practical depth remains far below theoretical predictions because of low photon efficiency and severe noise contamination. Here we present an integrated hardware and software solution that addresses these limitations. We developed a plug-and-play region-of-interest (ROI) imaging module that selectively excites neuron-occupied regions to improve power efficiency and reduce photothermal stress. The module incorporates frame-partitioned accumulative (FPA) imaging for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) structural acquisition, automated neuron segmentation, and motion-robust registration for stable recordings. Complementing this, OptiCal is a cascaded deep-learning framework that removes mixed noise including periodic, motion-induced, and random components. Together, these innovations enable high-fidelity imaging to 1.7 mm depth, extending the practical limit of 3PM by about 400 m while maintaining low excitation power. Our results reveal reliable calcium activity and behavior-correlated dynamics in deep medial prefrontal cortex of awake mice.",

    "title": "Attention modulates EEG spectral activity across serial positions",
    "content": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity has been associated with attentional processes such as task-irrelevant stimulus suppression and orienting. The aim of this study was to understand how spectral activity evolves as words are presented in a word list learning task and as multiple components of attention are engaged under multitasking demands. We recorded scalp EEG in a delayed free-recall task in which participants encoded common noun word lists either under full attention (encoding only) or divided attention (simultaneous target detection task). In the target detection task, participants pressed a response button when a word was paired with a target-colored square but not for words paired with a distractor-colored square (cue condition). Activity in the high gamma frequencies (50-100 Hz) decreased while alpha activity (8-12 Hz) increased throughout word list presentation (i.e., across serial positions), consistent with prior work demonstrating effects of cognitive load on EEG spectral power. Divided attention attenuated this change in gamma power across the list. Cue condition modulated alpha activity evenly across serial positions, with consistently lower power during target trials than distractor trials. Our findings suggest that frequency-specific characteristics of processing during list encoding may reflect multiple components of attention that vary over different time scales. Gamma frequencies capture the interactive effects of cognitive load and dual-task demands, while alpha power separately reflects gradual increases in cognitive load and momentary orienting.",

    "content": "Adaptive behavior requires maintaining and updating probabilistic beliefs about the world, yet how distributed brain circuits implement such computations remains unknown. We recorded from over 1,400 neurons across six brain regions in monkeys performing a multi-dimensional inference task requiring them to infer hidden rules through trial-and-error learning. Behavior was well-described by models based on Bayesian updating of beliefs over rule features. Neural representations of both observable variables (stimuli, rewards) and latent beliefs (rule preferences, confidence) were broadly distributed across hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, striatum, and inferior temporal cortex. Belief representations were present throughout all task periods but exhibited region- and epoch-specific dynamics. Critically, trial-to-trial changes in population activity reflected Bayesian belief updating: neural responses evolved according to the integration of prior beliefs with new evidence. Additionally, we identified confidence representations that were independent of specific beliefs and showed distinct temporal profiles. These results demonstrate that probabilistic inference emerges from coordinated dynamics across distributed brain systems, with different regions contributing flexibly according to computational demands at different states of learning and decision-making.",

    "content": "Adapting to uncertain environments requires distinguishing stochastic variability from genuine environmental change, yet how anxiety and sleep shape this process remains unclear. Using a probabilistic reversal-learning task that simultaneously manipulated stochasticity and volatility, we show that high trait anxiety selectively impairs reward learning in stable but noisy environments, despite preserved sensitivity to true volatility. Computational modeling revealed that anxious individuals misattribute stochastic fluctuations to environmental change, resulting in elevated reward learning rates and impaired evidence accumulation. In a second experiment combining task performance with overnight sleep EEG, greater N3 sleep was associated with reduced learning rates and improved evidence accumulation. These findings identify a selective computational mechanism underlying anxiety-related learning deficits and suggest N3 sleep as a state-dependent pathway for recalibrating adaptive learning under uncertainty.",

    "title": "Autistic Children Show Reduced Activity in Left Superior Temporal Cortex in Response to Social-emotional Meaning in Language",
    "content": "Background: Autistic children often exhibit challenges in social interaction, emotional processing, and language communication. While differences among autistic children in processing non-linguistic social-emotional cues compared to non-autistic pears are well-documented, the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of social-emotional meaning conveyed through the language content remain unclear. In non-autistic adults, the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) are sensitive to social-emotional semantics. We investigated whether this neural sensitivity is altered in autistic children. Methods: We recruited 78 children (54 autistic and 24 non-autistic; 68 males, 10 females; mean age 10 years) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while listening to sentences describing either people in emotional situations (social-emotional sentences) or sentences describing non-human objects, events, or concepts (object sentences). Results: Significant activity was found in the left STG and STS in response to social-emotional sentences across both groups, but the activity was reduced in autistic children compared to non-autistic controls. No significant group difference was found during general auditory or object-sentence processing. The neural activity in the left STG and STS during social-emotional sentence processing was significantly predicted by the degree of autistic social-affective characteristics but was not predicted by general linguistic ability. Conclusions: Autistic children show reduced activity in the left STG and STS compared to non-autistic peers during social-emotional sentence processing. This reduced activity, driven by social-affective characteristics rather than general linguistic ability, may contribute to autistic children's social communication challenges.",

    "title": "Membrane potential dynamics of peripheral cold-sensitive neurons in Drosophila larvae",
    "content": "Drosophila larvae sense diverse external stimuli through peripheral multidendritic (md) sensory neurons, among which Class III (CIII) neurons are essential for detecting noxious cold temperatures. Previous extracellular recordings showed that CIII neurons produce a characteristic phasic-tonic response to cold: a transient high-frequency spiking phase, during which about half of the neurons burst, followed by frequency adaptation. Here, we report the first intracellular recordings from CIII neurons, allowing us to characterize the membrane potential dynamics underlying their cold-evoked spiking responses. At rest, CIII neurons showed membrane potential fluctuations that occasionally triggered sporadic spikes. Cold stimulation induced a sustained depolarization that evoked a train of spikes, with spike rates peaking at 2-12 spikes/s within the first 5 s, followed by a gradual decline. About half of the neurons exhibited occasional bursts, in which clusters of 2-6 spikes at 10-120 Hz superimposed on a brief depolarizing hump. Cold stimulation also increased input resistance and amplified electrotonically spreading spikes, suggesting enhanced electrotonic signaling from distal sites via an increased space constant. Together, these findings provide key insights into the electrophysiological mechanisms of sensory encoding in peripheral neurons and establish a framework for dissecting the ionic and structural mechanisms of cold transduction.",

    "content": "Stress profoundly impacts systemic metabolism, yet the central circuits linking stress responses to peripheral metabolic regulation remain poorly defined. Here, we identify the preBotzinger complex (preBotC), a brainstem breathing rhythm generator, as a key stress-responsive hub coordinating metabolic adaptations. Using viral tracing, we show that preBotC neurons project to brown adipose tissue and liver, and that a subset of these projection neurons expresses the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor PAC1R, positioning PACAP signaling as a critical modulator of this circuit. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping revealed robust preBotC activation under stress, while spatial transcriptomics demonstrated altered neuronal metabolic circuitry in preBotC following PAC1R ablation. PAC1R knockdown in preBotC combined with stress resulted in blunted respiratory rhythmicity, reduced sympathetic innervation, and suppression of energy expenditure and lipid metabolic pathways in brown fat, while reprogramming hepatic transcriptional networks toward amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. These findings define a unique neuropeptidergic brainstem periphery circuit integrating stress, respiration, and metabolism.",

    "title": "MyoGen: Unified Biophysical Modeling of Human Neuromotor Activity and Resulting Signals",
    "content": "Understanding human motor control requires integrating cortical and spinal cord activity, muscle mechanics, and electrophysiology, levels that are often studied separately. We present MyoGen, an open-source framework that unifies spinal circuitry, proprioceptive feedback, musculotendon dynamics, cortical activity, and multimodal electromyography (EMG) generation in a single, interoperable platform. Spinal motor neurons and the resulting motor unit (MU) action potentials represent the only neural cells that can be accessed at scale in humans. We used human MU ensembles to validate our model across a wide range of experimental conditions. Using data-driven optimization, we found that MyoGen produces MU population activity that closely matches experimental discharge-rate distributions and discharge variability across human muscles. Moreover, it generates decomposable surface and intramuscular EMG, reproduces beta-band modulation of descending drive and its nonlinear transformation into force, and implements complete sensorimotor loops. Dimensionality reduction of simulated agonist-antagonist EMG reveals low-dimensional control manifolds consistent with experimental recordings from both healthy and spinal cord injured individuals. MyoGen provides physiologically grounded, ground-truth data and integrates seamlessly with analysis pipelines, enabling systematic investigation of motor control principles, validation of signal-processing algorithms, and exploration of sensorimotor interactions that are experimentally inaccessible.",

    "content": "Perceptual decisions are shaped by expectations about sensory stimuli and rewards, learned through sensory and reward prediction errors. Dopamine is known to convey reward prediction errors that shape perceptual decisions. However, whether dopamine also signals sensory prediction errors during perceptual decision-making remains unknown. We recorded dopamine release in the dorsal striatum of mice performing a visual decision-making task while manipulating sensory and reward expectations. The two manipulations produced similar behavioral biases but elicited opposite dopamine signals, indicating that dopamine within the same striatal region encoded both sensory and reward prediction errors. Sensory prediction error signaling was specific to dopamine as striatal acetylcholine showed no such error signals. Optogenetically stimulating striatal dopamine at stimulus onset biased subsequent perceptual decisions, consistent with updating sensory expectations. A computational model learning from both sensory and reward prediction errors captured behavioral biases and dopamine data, revealing distinct but spatially overlapping dopaminergic teaching signals.",

    "title": "Versatile Learning without Synaptic Plasticity in a Spiking Neural Network",
    "content": "Learning in the brain's cerebral cortex is widely attributed to synaptic plasticity among cortical neurons. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that alternative processes, such as modulation of intrinsic excitability or gating by subcortical inputs, may also serve as important learning mechanisms. We developed the Bias Adaptive Neural Firing Framework (BANFF) as a simplified model of such phenomena embodied by a learnable bias current for each neuron of a rate-based network. Here, we extend this framework to spiking neural networks. We show that learning such biases enables one recurrent spiking neural network with fixed and random synaptic weights to perform well on nine tasks spanning classification, regression, and closed-loop dynamical systems mimicry. The network learnt a unique bias set for each task, and unlike recurrent synapse-based learning, new learning did not interfere with previous learning. The network was robust to non-stationary F-I curves (spike frequency adaptation), and biases could be learned with a learning algorithm (e-prop) that is more biologically plausible than stock gradient descent. Overall, we show that the BANFF can be extended from rate-based to spiking neural networks, maintaining good multi-task performance with a single network of spiking neurons.",

    "title": "Emergence of focal cortical hyperexcitability in the murine tetanus toxin epilepsy model",
    "content": "Focal epilepsies are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders that may be caused by a large variety of underlying brain lesions. Long-term quality of life prognosis is often poor, and treatment options are limited. Despite significant progress in animal model sophistication over the past decades, a deeper understanding of epileptogenic processes on a mesoscale and microscale circuit level is needed. Here we model focal epileptogenesis in mice using single intracortical tetanus toxin injections and employ chronic in vivo two-photon and widefield calcium imaging with simultaneous EEG and behavioral video recordings (\"multimodal\" recordings) to follow epileptogenic changes over time. We observe a moderate increase in global brain excitability on EEG but, more strikingly, a gradual emergence of brief but intense optically recorded epileptiform events (\"microseizures\") that are spatially limited, peaking around 20-30 days after toxin injection and waning over the next 30 days. During these events, a majority of local neurons are recruited into extreme depolarization, yet there is considerable variability in duration and spatial coverage between events, depending on the proximity to the injection focus and the number of days elapsed since injection. Notably, EEG electrodes <3 mm from the focus typically fail to detect these events, highlighting the utility of high-resolution in vivo optical imaging for capturing all events in focal epileptogenesis. Single-cell patch clamp recordings in awake animals confirm that microseizure episodes are associated with depolarization block, during which the calcium signal remains high. Using chronic multimodal recordings, we detect an initial rise of interictal activity in local cortical networks during the first day after injection, followed by a layer-specific suppression and dysregulation of interictal spontaneous network activity in local cortical circuits preceding microseizure events, and low-level suppression when microseizures started subsiding. The chronic suppression in interictal activity is accompanied by relative hypoactivity of PV+ interneurons and concurrent hyperactivity of SOM+ interneurons. This integrated imaging-electrophysiology approach provides a powerful platform for unraveling circuit-level mechanisms of focal epilepsy and potentially for identifying and testing novel therapeutic strategies in the future.",

    "content": "The center surround structure of ganglion cells receptive fields is suited for edge detection, a first step towards image segmentation. However, in a dynamical visual scene with moving objects, it is less clear how the retina represents the boundaries of moving objects and therefore contributes to motion segmentation. Here, we show that the spatial selectivity of ganglion cells changes during their responses to a moving object. Specific cell types only respond to contrast changes near the edges of the moving object. Using a non-linear model to reproduce this result, we could isolate the mechanism responsible for this edge tracking behavior. Different types provide complementary representation of a moving object, some enhancing its boundaries, and may thus provide primitives for motion segmentation.",

    "title": "System-wide profiling reveals metabolic alterations in a G2019S LRRK2 knockin mouse model of Parkinson's disease: systemic depletion of pyrimidine nucleosides",
    "content": "Background: The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 is the most common genetic cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with increased susceptibility to sporadic PD, which likely arises from the interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental exposure, and aging. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been implicated as an independent risk factor for PD, but the potential interaction between the G2019S LRRK2 mutation and metabolic stress in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: We employed long-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to induce metabolic syndrome in aged LRRK2 mutant mice, followed by system-wide characterization using multi-omic approaches, including metabolomic profiling, proteomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Results: We find that thymidine and deoxyuridine levels are consistently reduced across tissues in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice at baseline, accompanied by increased hepatic expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP). HFD exposure further unmasks disruptions in purine and energy metabolism in the brain and lungs of G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice, with astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the ventral midbrain exhibiting the most pronounced impairment in oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional pathways. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that pre-existing metabolic syndrome unmasks widespread disruptions in systemic nucleotide and energy metabolism and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice. This conditional \"two-hit\" phenotype underscores the critical role of environmental factors, such as diet, in revealing metabolic vulnerabilities associated with PD-linked genetic backgrounds. Our study provides novel insight into potential metabolic targets or pathways for therapeutic intervention in individuals at-risk for developing PD.",

    "title": "The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Modulates the Functional Output of Human Taste Bud Cells",
    "content": "We recently discovered that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), which functions as a channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelial surfaces, is expressed in both human and murine TBCs, but how it functions in these cells remains unknown. We postulated that CFTR may impact peripheral taste signaling at the level of taste receptor-expressing cells of the taste bud. To begin to test this hypothesis, we assessed how pharmacological manipulation of CFTR could affect the functional responses of human fungiform taste bud cells to prototypical taste stimuli (e.g., bitter, sweet, fat) using single cell calcium imaging and neurotransmitter (ATP) release measurements. We first established the presence of CFTR in these cells using immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. We next found that CFTR inhibition generally increased stimulus-evoked calcium responses but that the specific response parameters impacted varied across different stimuli, likely due to differences in signal transduction mechanisms and the involvement of store-operated calcium channels. For example, response amplitudes to bitter and sweet stimuli were significantly enhanced with no changes in the proportion of cells responding to these stimuli whereas the opposite trends were observed with a fatty acid stimulus. Additionally, bitter-evoked neurotransmitter release was significantly enhanced by CFTR inhibition, suggesting that this effect is reflected throughout the signal transduction cascade. Ongoing and future experiments are utilizing shRNA knockdown as well as intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology to further interrogate the impacts of CFTR. In addition to human TBCs, we have detected CFTR in mouse taste tissues. Moreover, we have mined mouse TBC RNA sequencing datasets to determine CFTR co-expression patterns to inform future cellular and behavioral experiments in mice. Taken together, these data suggest that CFTR can modulate the signaling output of the taste bud.",

    "title": "Characterization of Lysine Methylation During Neuronal Differentiation of LUHMES cells.",
    "content": "Over one-third of human lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases (KDMs)-the enzymes responsible for adding or removing methylation on lysine residues within proteins-are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Consequently, several studies have explored the roles of specific KMTs or KDMs in neuronal differentiation, and alterations in histone methylation patterns have been identified. It is now widely recognized that KMTs and KDMs also target non-histone proteins, yet knowledge of how non-histone lysine methylation changes during neuronal differentiation remains limited. Here, we address this gap using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify and measure changes in non-histone lysine methylation at three different stages in the Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) neuronal differentiation model. We identify 74 lysine methylation sites with significant differences in abundance across differentiation. Our analysis reveals lysine methylation on many non-histone proteins involved in neuronal differentiation and neurodevelopment, including signaling molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, RNA splicing factors, and transcription factors. Overall, this work broadens the understanding of non-histone lysine methylation in a neuronal differentiation model and offers a valuable resource of lysine methylation sites on proteins of biological and clinical significance for future research.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

I just want to do some task/project and checkout.\n- Fully remote will be ideal.\n- Salary can be on the low end.\n- I feel the world currently is too hyper-capitalistic and I don't think I fit in well. On top of that my country has a billion+ people and everything seems like battle for scraps.<p>Unless I hit home with some indie hacking/side project, I don't think this will be possible. I believe there must some niche apps/plugin/extension/ssydev roles for some crm/cms etc that might fit the bill.<p>Few point to note:\n- No, I'm not that depressed. I'm just deeply unhappy with the current state of things.\n- No, I'm not giving up on life.\n- It may look like I'm not be good fit for tech/programming jobs. But I still like tech and solving tech problems. I just dont want my life to revolve around it.\n- It could be that im not challenged well in my job. But I'm not sure whether I'd like to be drowned in work as well.<p>Thanks for any advice or hostile/dismissive comments you provide I appreciate it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468959\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468959</a></p>\n<p>Points: 22</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "title": "TSLNet: a hierarchical multi-head attention-enabled two-stream LSTM network for accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition",
    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "Brain-wide Organization of Post-Synaptic Sites: Three Principles",
    "content": "Synapses are fundamental units of neural computation and structural plasticity in the brain, yet their brain-wide spatial organization in mammals remains largely unknown. Building on our previous mapping and modeling of dendritic spines and axonal boutons, we developed a statistical approach to generate over 17.99 million predicted post-synaptic sites based on the potential arbor contacts (PPSSPAC) across the dendritic arbors of 155,743 neurons spanning the entire mouse brain. By analyzing the topological features of these sites, we identified three key organizational principles. First, PPSSPAC exhibits a distinct region-specific spatial pattern at the dendritic branch level, preferentially enriching near the distal ends of dendritic segments, in contrast to the valley-like distribution of pre-synaptic sites along axonal branches. Cross-species validation against independent electron microscopy datasets from mouse and human brains, revealed a conserved and previously unquantified pattern of synaptic organization. Second, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC effectively captures variations across cell types in the hippocampus, enabling neuron classification based on synaptic architecture. This serves as a complementary mesoscale descriptor to existing classifications based on global neuronal connectivity (source-target relationships) or local dendritic microenvironments. Third, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC, rather than synapse density, shows remarkable correlation with independent whole-brain electrophysiological activity. The spatial organization of PPSSPAC also correlates with several gene expression datasets. These results suggest the post-synaptic pattern could be mediator linking molecular signatures, neural dynamics, and connectivity types of cells. Our study reveals, for the first time, a structural substrate for hierarchical information processing in the brain, providing new insights into neural computation and a foundation for brain digital twin models to support next-generation AI infrastructure.",

    "title": "Neuronal excitability and parameter variability in the Hodgkin-Huxley model",
    "content": "Biophysically detailed neuron models are often built as a one-way pipeline in which voltage-clamp data are reduced to a single set of best-fit channel parameters, which are then combined into a deterministic spiking model. This practice discards experimentally observed variability and obscures the mechanisms by which robustness and degeneracy arise in excitable systems. Here, we reintroduce parameter variability into the Hodgkin-Huxley model and embed uncertainty and global sensitivity analysis into model construction. We digitized sodium and potassium rate constant data from the original Hodgkin and Huxley figures and used bootstrap resampling to estimate the variability of the voltage-dependent kinetic parameters. We then propagated these uncertainty estimates through a spatially extended squid axon cable model using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. At the channel level, first-order Sobol sensitivity indices revealed that all kinetic parameters contribute to output variance in a strongly time-dependent manner, with distinct parameters controlling transient and steady-state behavior for potassium and sodium conductances. At the level of neuronal excitability, sampling hundreds of thousands of parameter sets produced a heterogeneous population of firing behaviors, including non-firing, phasic, regular, and spontaneous activity. Across stimulus amplitudes, the dominant firing mode was a single spike at stimulus onset. At the same time, the regularly firing subpopulation exhibited a broad distribution of firing rates, with a mean that matched the classic Hodgkin-Huxley prediction. In the phasic subpopulation, action potential propagation and conduction velocity varied widely yet remained consistent with experimental ranges. Finally, global sensitivity analysis during spiking shows uniformly small first-order indices but large total-order indices, indicating that excitability is primarily governed by strong interactions among parameters rather than by any single conductance or kinetic parameter. These results support a population-based view of conductance-based modeling in which biologically relevant behavior emerges from structured regions of parameter space.",

    "title": "Cognition does not automatically influence perception: Evidence from neural encoding of colours belonging to different categories",
    "content": "The firmest evidence in favour of models that posit early high-level influences of cognition on perception comes from electroencephalography (EEG). Enhanced early, pre-attentive processing of light and dark blue feature changes compared to light and dark green changes was reported in Greek speakers, who have two basic terms for 'blue' (ghalazio/ble). In the present three-experiment study, we systematically re-evaluate this evidence and test an alternative model that the early difference waves in the human EEG instead mainly reflect contrast adaptation phenomena. We use the same classical oddball paradigm presenting alternating light or dark standards and deviants that systematically differ in colour and/or luminance and chromatic contrast. We then calculate the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), a putative index of pre-attentive feature change processing and predictive coding derived from EEG data, by subtracting the activity elicited by standards from that elicited by task-irrelevant deviants. Our experiments demonstrate the following: 1) vMMN is driven by contrast adaptation, being observable only in the presence of contrast differences between the stimuli and not reliably observed for different hues of equal contrast; 2) there is no reliable difference between green- and blue-related difference waves in speakers with two basic blue colour categories, the difference waves again driven by contrast rather than their categorical content. Our findings are highly significant for the debate concerning the interface between perception and cognition, as the absence of early categorical effects speaks against models that predict Whorfian-type cognitive influences.",

The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "title": "A System for Live Sorting of Neuronal Spiking Activity from Large-scale Recordings",
    "content": "Online monitoring and quantification of neural signals has tremendous value both for neurofeedback experiments and for brain-computer interfaces. Unfortunately, established methods of online monitoring primarily involve the use of thresholded neural activity rather than sorted single-neuron spikes. The recent introduction of large-scale, high-density electrophysiology has enabled the recording of activity from hundreds of neurons simultaneously in both model organisms and human participants. This development highlights the need for a robust and easily implementable system for sorting spikes during data collection for live analyses of neuronal signals. Here, we describe a system for live sorting of neuronal activity (LSS) based on the widely used Kilosort platform. The LSS workflow utilizes an initial period of recorded neural data to identify waveform templates using Kilosort. LSS then interfaces with the SpikeGLX API to retrieve small batches (e.g. 50 ms) of data and for processing online. We measured the similarity of single-neuron activity sorted live by LSS to that sorted offline in neurophysiological recordings from macaque visual cortex using Neuropixels probes. We show that LSS closely replicates the post-stimulus time histograms and visual response tuning curves of single-neurons obtained using offline sorting. Furthermore, we show that decoding neural signals online with LSS consistently outperforms online decoding of thresholded activity, and that LSS can achieve the same performance as that obtained with offline sorting.",

    "content": "Key operations in modeling visual processing in living systems are those that process a pattern as a holistic object, for example, in pattern recognition to ensure invariance to translation and rotation. In this article, we describe a neural module we synthesized for moving a pattern along a cortical layer without losing its shape. The module has the form of a three-layer neural network with two types of inhibitory neurons, one of which is a universal prohibition logic element. Modeling showed that such operations can be implemented using the proposed neural module by additionally synchronizing its operation using endogenous pacemakers with a gamma rhythm frequency. The mechanism of such synchronization is similar to the clock sweep mechanism in electronics. We believe we have clearly demonstrated the possible role of gamma-based brain activity as a mechanism for synchronizing computations in living neural networks for the first time. This opens up new possibilities for constructing neuromorphic architectures for real-time visual recognition.",

    "content": "<p>I\u2019ve been working on a solution to the \"Physical Oracle Problem\" (trustless trading of physical goods) and just released the full Alpha implementation.<p>The Core Thesis: Existing decentralized marketplaces rely on reputation, which inevitably centralizes. Dealta replaces reputation with a Nash Equilibrium-based mechanism. We use staked, pseudo-randomly selected \"Brokers\" to physically verify goods. The protocol ensures that honesty is the dominant strategy for all actors via strict payoff matrices. It intended use is preferably trading of mid to high value goods. Nobody expecting a computer, want a box full of stones.<p>What we are releasing: a custom Layer-1 blockchain stack.<p>Full Node: Implements Hybrid Consensus (PoW + PBFT) for instant finality.<p>Integrated Wallet: Native key management and transaction construction for the custom trade opcodes.<p>DB Management: Custom indexing for trade states and dispute evidence.<p>The system is currently in Alpha. I am looking for feedback on the protocol design, the node architecture and collaborators.<p>Code needs polishing, which i will do if people like the project. \nHowever, the project runs, and a testnet will be launched if people take interest in the project.<p>Readme files will be updated as well. Currently they provide a simple guide on how to build the project.<p>Feel free to send an email. It can be found my in profile or in the paper.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46464133\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46464133</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "<p>Hello HN,<p>I\u2019m Joseph, a solo developer. I built CustomPaste because I was frustrated by the binary choice standard clipboard tools give us: either keep all the messy formatting (background colors, huge fonts) or strip everything down to plain text.<p>We all know Ctrl+Shift+V (paste as plain text), but that is often too destructive, it kills hyperlinks, bolding, and lists when I usually just want to normalize the font family (e.g., force Arial 11pt) or remove background colors.<p>I wanted a tool that let me \"strip exactly what I want, and keep exactly what I want.\"<p>The Solution: Instead of a single \"paste\" behavior, the app lets you create reusable \"Recipes\" to define exactly how your text should land in your editor. It intercepts the clipboard, processes the structure locally, and transforms it based on your rules.<p>It offers granular control over:<p><pre><code>    Smart Preservation: You can strip or set specific font families and sizes but specifically preserve bold, italics, and hyperlinks.\n</code></pre>\nStructure: You can preserve tables while stripping the images inside them.<p>Data Cleanup: It can instantly purge duplicate lines, sort lists alphabetically, or flatten extra blank lines.<p>Text Fixes: It cleans up AI-generated artifacts (like \"smart quotes\" or em-dashes) and enforces casing (Title Case, Sentence Case).<p>Privacy & Pricing: The app runs 100% locally on your machine, no cloud processing and no data harvesting. It is a one-time purchase (lifetime license), not a subscription. There is a free trial (first 100 pastes) so you can test if it fits your workflow.<p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on the \"Recipe\" approach or any other edge cases you struggle with when pasting text!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "title": "Transcriptional Heterogeneity Reveals a Synaptic Gene Program in Developing and Adult Human Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells",
    "content": "Human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) arise early in gestation and expand broadly during cortical development, yet the extent of their heterogeneity remains poorly defined. Here, we isolated >2,300 highly pure OPCs from post-conceptional week (PCW) 17 human cortex using an optimized PDGFR-based immunopanning and performed single-cell RNA sequencing. Unsupervised clustering revealed four transcriptionally distinct embryonic OPC subsets, including a previously unrecognized population that expressed genes linked to synaptic development, synaptic signaling, and neuromodulation. This subset - designated embryonic synaptic OPCs (eSyn-OPCs) - comprised approximately 28.5% of all embryonic OPCs in the cortex and was characterized by robust expression of synapse-associated secreted factors (THBS2, WNT5A, WNT7A, PLAT, ACHE) and multiple neurotransmitter receptor subunits. Histological analyses across PCW 12-22 demonstrated that eSyn-OPCs first appear around PCW 15 and are enriched in proliferative germinal zones. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed their localization near neural stem and progenitor cells, suggesting proximal neuron-OPC communication during early cortical assembly. Purified eSyn-OPCs differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, confirming their oligodendrocyte lineage identity. Reanalysis of adult human single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets uncovered a transcriptionally analogous OPC subset (adult synaptic OPCs, aSyn-OPCs), though with reduced representation of structural synaptic genes and neurotransmitter receptor diversity compared to eSyn-OPCs. Together, these results identify a synaptically specialized OPC population in both developing and adult human cortex and reveal that eSyn-OPCs possess unexpectedly rich synaptic signaling machinery. These findings suggest that human OPCs may participate directly in neuron-glia communication during early cortical development and raise the possibility of developmental stage-specific roles for eSyn-OPCs in shaping neural circuit formation.",

    "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
    "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

    "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
    "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

    "title": "Altering visual feedback during reaching: no mitigating effect on pain for individuals with complex regional pain syndrome, but visuomotor adaptation is preserved",
    "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

    "title": "Intrinsic excitability of rat hippocampal granule cells increases along the dorsal-to-ventral axis",
    "content": "The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus exhibits striking anatomical and functional heterogeneity along its dorsoventral axis, yet the intrinsic electrophysiological diversity of its principal excitatory neurons, the granule cells, across the dorsoventral axis remains unexplored. Here, we systematically examined the electrophysiological properties of DG granule cells across the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral regions of the rat hippocampus. We found a progressive increase in input resistance, impedance amplitude, and firing rate of granule cells, accompanied by a gradual slowdown in repolarization kinetics of their action potentials along the dorsal-to-ventral axis. Our analyses demonstrated that granule cells acted as class I integrators that lacked strong resonance properties across the dorsoventral axis. We performed pairwise correlation and dimensionality reduction analyses to reveal weak dependencies across physiological measurements and the absence of distinct clusters for dorsal, intermediate, or ventral granule cells. Importantly, blade-specific analyses of granule cell physiology revealed that all measurements manifested pronounced heterogeneities even within a given dorsoventral section and a specific blade. Strikingly, ventral granule cells in the infrapyramidal blade manifested higher firing rates compared to their counterparts in the suprapyramidal blade. These blade-specific differences were limited to the ventral granule cells, with negligible distinctions between granule cells in the two blades of either dorsal or intermediate hippocampus. Together, our findings unveil a progressive increase in excitability of DG granule cells along the dorsal-to-ventral axis and a blade-specific granularity of firing properties, adding new dimensions to the several known anatomical, molecular, and behavioral differences across the hippocampal dorsoventral axis.",

In primates, the MGE has a distinctive cytoarchitecture characterized by doublecortin enriched cellular nests (DENs), yet the architectonic organization underlying DEN formation, the molecular heterogeneity of ganglionic eminence progenitors and their lineage relationships, remain poorly understood. Here, using paired single-nucleus transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling of the three GEs, we identify distinct progenitor populations, delineate their gene regulatory networks, and reconstruct their lineage trajectories. Live imaging reveals a unipolar outer radial glia-like population (GE-oRG) that undergoes mitotic somal translocation. Spatial transcriptomics identifies a distinct CRABP1+/ANGPT2+ domain within the MGE. Integrated spatial and electron microscopy demonstrates a periphery-to-center gradient of differentiation in the MGE. Leveraging DEN-forming MGE organoids derived from PCDH19 knockout human pluripotent stem cell lines, we identify the protocadherin, PCDH19, as a key regulator of DEN formation.",

    "content": "The SEZ6 family, composed of SEZ6, SEZ6L, and SEZ6L2, plays essential roles in neurodevelopment, synaptic organization, and complement regulation. However, the specific contribution of SEZ6L2 to brain function remains largely unexplored. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive behavioral and neurobiological characterization of Sez6l2 knockout (KO) mice and directly compare their phenotype with Sez6 triple knockout (TKO) mice, which lack all three Sez6 family genes. Sez6l2 KO mice exhibit impairments across multiple behavioral domains, including motor coordination, gait, sociability, sensory processing, and goal-directed repetitive behaviors. Several phenotypes, particularly motor deficits, worsen with age. Male Sez6l2 KO mice also demonstrate enhanced fear learning and increased prepulse inhibition, revealing sex-specific alterations in sensorimotor gating. At the synaptic level, Sez6l2 KO mice show reduced dendritic spine length and decreased expression of key postsynaptic proteins suggesting impaired excitatory synaptic connectivity. These structural and molecular abnormalities likely contribute to the observed behavioral deficits. In comparison, Sez6 TKO mice display more severe impairments across most measures. Together, these findings establish SEZ6L2 as a critical and non-redundant regulator of motor, cognitive, and synaptic function and provide mechanistic insight into how dysfunction within the SEZ6 family may contribute to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "content": "While the experience of stress is ubiquitous, the risk of developing stress-linked conditions such as anxiety and depression is related to maladaptive stress responses. In order to probe the relationship between stress coping, sex, and stress-linked behavioral outcomes, we exposed male and female mice to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) and measured the correlation between coping during the tail suspension stressors (TSS) of SCVS and avoidance behavior in the EPM. We found that females engage in more active coping, and there were no sex differences in avoidance or locomotor behavior in the EPM after stress. However, we found that greater active coping predicted greater avoidance in females, but less avoidance in males. The results demonstrate that coping strategies are dynamic across time in males and females, but the relationships between avoidance and coping strategy dynamics are sex-biased.",

    "title": "Meta-learning is expressed through altered prefrontal cortical dynamics",
    "content": "Learning where and when rewards like food and water are available is essential for survival. In the simplest cases where resource availability is stable, animals can learn reward contingencies by integrating outcomes across repeated samples of each option. In more natural settings, however, reward availability is governed by complex contingencies such as depletion and repletion over time. To flexibly adapt to such changing environments, optimal choices require meta-learning wherein animals learn how to learn from external feedback, eventually enabling them to infer reward contingencies from more abstract and generalizable rules rather than relying solely on recent outcomes. The existence of meta-learning in animal behavior is well established, yet the neural circuits and computations that implement it remain poorly understood. Here we investigated meta-learning using a spatial foraging task in which rats acquired a novel depletion-repletion rule, and carried out longitudinal, high-density recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We show that meta-learning engages specific, systematic changes in mPFC neural dynamics that embed the learned rule and thereby alter the way the network learns option values from reward outcomes. These dynamics are based on mixed coding of task structure and value in individual mPFC neurons which, at the population level, organize into low-dimensional dynamical motifs that generalize across task conditions. As meta-learning progresses, these motifs are reshaped to instantiate both rule-guided inference of future states before outcome delivery and rule-based value updating during the outcome period. These results indicate that meta-learning sculpts pre-existing prefrontal dynamics to support the acquisition of new reward-learning strategies.",

    "content": "The capacity and flexibility of hippocampal circuits for transforming inputs into downstream outputs is fundamental for navigation and memory, yet the circuit-level mechanisms that allow this operation to adapt across experiences remain unknown. We approach this problem by performing large-scale (up to 1024-channel) recordings across the hippocampal-retrosplenial cortex (RSC) circuit in behaving mice, enabling simultaneous access to spiking activity in dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, CA2, CA1, RSC. Based on a linear dimensionality reduction technique known as partial canonical correlation analysis, we identify low-dimensional communication subspaces1 between two regions while accounting for measured third-area influences. These subspaces captured distinct input-output transformations in CA1, linking upstream (DG, CA3, and CA2) hippocampal activity to downstream cortical targets (RSC). Iintrinsic firing properties and anatomical location constrained subspace memberships--members were mapped to deep sublayers of the CA3-CA1-RSC axis during both spatial and non-spatial tasks. These subspaces could recombine overlapping neuronal pools to support distinct interareal interactions across changing experiences and brain states. Reactivation patterns of CA1-CA3 subspaces, but not those of CA1-RSC, during post-experience sleep correlated with replay, reflecting a plasticity-stability balance of the input-output transformation in the hippocampal-retrosplenial axis. Our data suggest a model in which hippocampal-neocortical communication reconfigures predetermined circuit motifs to flexibly encode experiences.",

    "title": "Decoding semantic categories: insights from an fMRI ALE meta analysis",
    "content": "Objective. The human brain organizes conceptual knowledge into semantic categories; however, the extent to which these categories share common or distinct neural representations remains unclear. This study aims to clarify this organizational structure by identifying consistent, modality-controlled activation patterns across several widely used and frequently investigated semantic domains in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research. By quantifying the distinctiveness and overlap among these patterns, we provide a more precise foundation for understanding the brain\u2019s semantic architecture, as well as for applications such as semantic brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCI). Approach. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 75 fMRI studies covering six semantic categories: animals, tools, food, music, body parts, and pain. Using activation likelihood estimation, we identified convergent activation patterns for each category while controlling for stimulus modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and written). Subsequently, Jaccard-based overlap analyses were performed to quantify the degree of neural commonality and separability across concept-modality pairs, thereby revealing the underlying structure of representational similarity. Main results. Distinct yet partially overlapping activation networks were identified for each semantic category. Tools and animals showed shared activity in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal regions, reflecting common object-based visual processing. In contrast, food-related stimuli primarily recruited limbic and subcortical structures associated with affective and motivational processing. Music and animal sounds overlapped within the superior temporal and insular cortices, whereas body parts and pain engaged occipito-parietal and cingulo-insular networks, respectively. Together, these findings reveal a hierarchically organized and modality-dependent semantic architecture in the human brain. Significance. This meta-analysis offers a quantitative and integrative characterization of how semantic knowledge is distributed and differentiated across cortical systems. By demonstrating how conceptual content and sensory modality jointly shape neural organization, the study refines theoretical models of semantic cognition and provides a methodological basis for evaluating conceptual separability. These insights have direct implications for semantic neural decoding and for the development of BCI systems grounded in meaning-based neural representations.",

This paper builds on prior work by introducing a handwritten test suite\u2014Multi-Order Theory of Mind Q&amp;A\u2014and using it to compare the performance of five LLMs of varying sizes and training paradigms to a newly gathered adult human benchmark. We find that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM reach adult-level and near adult-level performance on our ToM tasks overall, and that GPT-4 exceeds adult performance on 6th order inferences. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between model size and finetuning for higher-order ToM performance, and that the linguistic abilities of large models may support more complex ToM inferences. Given the important role that higher-order ToM plays in group social interaction and relationships, these findings have significant implications for the development of a broad range of social, educational and assistive LLM applications.",

    "content": "BackgroundIschemic stroke is an acute neurological disorder with limited treatment options. Medical cannabinoids (MCs), primary bioactive compounds extracted from cannabis plants, have shown therapeutic prospects for ischemic stroke. This study integrates bibliometrics and meta-analysis to comprehensively summarize the research landscape of MCs in cerebral ischemia and thoroughly investigate their role and potential mechanisms in ischemic stroke.MethodsBibliometric analysis was performed based on literature retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), PubMed, and Scopus. For meta-analysis, a comprehensive search was conducted across four databases (WoSCC, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) and grey literature repositories. Studies were screened according to predefined criteria. Pooled standardized mean differences with 95% confidence interval were calculated, followed by subgroup analysis.ResultsA total of 241 publications were identified for bibliometric analysis. From 2000 to June 2025, the annual publication output on MCs in cerebral ischemia displayed a fluctuating yet overall upward trend. Keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed three major research topics: neuroprotective mechanisms of MCs, pathological models of cerebral ischemia, and bioactive components of MCs. Meta-analysis of 26 studies demonstrated that MCs provided significant neuroprotection in animal models of ischemic stroke, including cerebral infarct volume, neurological function score (NFS), cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability, brain water content, apoptosis (TUNEL-positive cells), oxidative stress markers, inflammation (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), and excitotoxicity (Glu/NAA, Lac/NAA ratio). Subgroup analysis revealed that intraperitoneal administration and a full-course of cannabidiol (CBD) treatment were associated with reduced heterogeneity and enhanced therapeutic benefit. Isoflurane was identified as a potentially suitable anesthetic.ConclusionMCs exert multi-target neuroprotection in ischemic stroke by improving CBF, reducing brain edema and BBB permeability, and inhibiting oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity. Future research should focus on high-quality clinical trials to validate these findings and translate MCs into clinical practice.Systematic review registrationhttps://osf.io/6je7n.",

    "title": "Transfer learning for subject-independent motor imagery EEG classification using convolutional relational networks",
    "content": "Motor imagery (MI) based electroencephalography (EEG) classification is central to brain-computer interface (BCI) research but practical deployment remains challenging due to poor generalization across subjects. Inter-individual variability in neural activity patterns significantly limits the development of subject-independent BCIs for healthcare and assistive technologies. To address this limitation, we present a transfer learning framework based on Convolutional Relational Networks (ConvoReleNet) designed to extract subject-invariant neural representations while minimizing the risk of catastrophic forgetting. The method integrates convolutional feature extraction, relational modeling, and lightweight recurrent processing, combined with pretraining on a diverse subject pool followed by conservative fine-tuning. Validation was conducted on two widely used benchmarks, BNCI IV-2a (four-class motor imagery) and BNCI IV-2b (binary motor imagery), to evaluate subject-independent classification performance. Results demonstrate clear improvements over training from scratch: accuracy on BNCI IV-2a increased from 72.22 (\u00b120.49) to 79.44% (\u00b111.09), while BNCI IV-2b improved from 75.10 (\u00b117.17) to 83.85% (\u00b110.30). The best-case performance reached 87.55% on BNCI IV-2a with Tanh activation and 83.85% on BNCI IV-2b with ELU activation, accompanied by reductions in inter-subject variance of 45.9 and 40.0%, respectively. These findings establish transfer learning as an effective strategy for subject-independent MI-EEG classification. By enhancing accuracy, reducing variability, and maintaining computational efficiency, the proposed framework strengthens the feasibility of robust and user-friendly BCIs for rehabilitation, clinical use, and assistive applications.",

It supports modern and legacy Microsoft Office files (.docx/.xlsx/.pptx and .doc/.xls/.ppt), PDFs, emails (.eml/.msg/.mbox), OpenDocument formats, HTML, and common plain-text formats \u2014 all through a single, unified API.</p> <p><em>The key point: no LibreOffice, no Java, no shelling out. Just pip install and run. Everything is parsed directly in Python and exposed via generators for memory-efficient processing.</em></p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Developers working with file extractions tasks. Lately these are in particular AI/RAG use-cases.</p> <p>Typical use cases:</p> <p>- RAG / LLM ingestion pipelines</p> <p>- SharePoint or file-share document indexing</p> <p>- Serverless workloads (AWS Lambda, GCP Functions)</p> <p>- Containerized services with tight image size limits</p> <p>- Security-restricted environments where subprocesses are a no-go</p> <p>If you need to reliably extract text and structure from messy, real-world enterprise document collections \u2014 especially ones that still contain decades of legacy Office files \u2014 this is built for you.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most existing solutions rely on external tools:</p> <p>- LibreOffice-based pipelines require large system installs and fragile headless setups.</p> <p>- Apache Tika depends on Java and often runs as a separate service.</p> <p>- Subprocess-based wrappers add operational and security overhead.</p> <p>sharepoint-to-text takes a different approach:</p> <p>- Pure Python, no system dependencies</p> <p>- Works the same locally, in containers, and in serverless environments</p> <p>- One unified interface for all formats (no branching logic per file type)</p> <p>- Native support for legacy Office formats that are common in old SharePoint instances</p> <p>If you want something lightweight, predictable, and easy to embed directly into Python applications \u2014 without standing up extra infrastructure \u2014 that\u2019s the gap this library is trying to fill.</p> <p>Link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Horsmann/sharepoint-to-text\">https://github.com/Horsmann/sharepoint-to-text</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AsparagusKlutzy1817\"> /u/AsparagusKlutzy1817 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q130ln/sharepointtotext_pure_python_text_extraction_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q130ln/sharepointtotext_pure_python_text_extraction_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

It coordinates schema changes between producers and consumers across dbt, OpenAPI, GraphQL, and Kafka.</p> <p>Producers must acknowledge breaking changes before publishing. Consumers register their dependencies, receive notifications when schemas change, and can block breaking changes until they\u2019re ready to migrate.</p> <p>Target Audience</p> <p>Data teams dealing with schema evolution, data contracts, or frequent incidents from uncoordinated breaking changes. It\u2019s production-intended and MIT licensed, built with Python &amp; FastAPI.</p> <p>Comparison</p> <p>* Kafka Schema Registry: Only handles Kafka topics. Tessera extends the same concept to dbt models, APIs, and other data sources.</p> <p>* dbt contracts: Define expectations but don\u2019t track downstream consumers or coordinate change timing.</p> <p>* Data catalogs (Atlan, DataHub): Focus on discovery and documentation, not change coordination or blocking.</p> <p>Tessera sits in the middle and answers: \u201cwho depends on this, and are they ready for this change?\u201d</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Low-Sandwich-7607\"> /u/Low-Sandwich-7607 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q0jzwl/tessera_schema_registry_for_dbt/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q0jzwl/tessera_schema_registry_for_dbt/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

We present a cross-domain benchmark of profit-seeking direct prompt injection in customer-service interactions, spanning 10 service domains and 100 realistic attack scripts grouped into five technique families. Across five widely used models under a unified rubric with uncertainty reporting, attacks are highly domain-dependent (airline support is most exploitable) and technique-dependent (payload splitting is most consistently effective). We release data and evaluation code to support reproducible auditing and to inform the design of oversight and recovery workflows for trustworthy, human centered agent interfaces.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.24029v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: A single service robot can present two distinct agencies: its onboard autonomy and an operator-mediated agency, yet users experience them through one physical body. We formalize this dual-agency structure as a User-Robot-Operator triad in an autonomous remote-control setting that combines autonomous execution with remote human support. Prior to the recent surge of language-based and multimodal interfaces, we developed and evaluated an early-stage prototype in 2020 that combined natural-language text chat with freehand sketch annotations over the robot's live camera view to support remote intervention. We evaluated three modes - autonomous, remote, and hybrid - in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field. The results show systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, indicating that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions. These findings provide empirical guidance for designing human-in-the-loop mobile manipulation in domestic physical tasks.",

    "title": "From Correctness to Collaboration: Toward a Human-Centered Framework for Evaluating AI Agent Behavior in Software Engineering",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.23844v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from code generators into collaborative partners for software engineers, our methods for evaluation are lagging. Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.\n  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent. Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.23835v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.",

    "title": "Vibe Coding, Interface Flattening",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.24939v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models are reshaping programming by enabling 'vibe coding': the development of softwares through natural-language interaction with model-driven toolchains. This article argues that vibe coding is best understood as interface flattening, a reconfiguration in which previously distinct modalities (GUI, CLI, and API) appear to converge into a single conversational surface, even as the underlying chain of translation from intention to machinic effect lengthens and thickens. Drawing on Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's account of interfaces as sites of protocol control, the paper situates programming as a historically localised interface arrangement rather than an essential relation to computation. Through a materialist reconstruction of the contemporary vibe-coding stack, it shows how remote compute infrastructures, latency and connectivity, structured outputs, function/tool calling, and interoperability standards such as the Model Context Protocol relocate control and meaning-making power to model and protocol providers. The apparent democratisation of technical capability therefore depends on new dependencies and new literacies. By foregrounding the tension between experiential flattening and infrastructural thickening, I demonstrate how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic labour/power, obscures responsibility, and privatises competencies previously dispersed across programming communities, contributing a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interaction.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.24632v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In collaborative settings, difficulties in sustaining a consistent pace and engagement often lead to task drift, reducing preparedness and overall effectiveness between meetings. To address this challenge, we conducted a formative study and developed ReflecToMeet, an AI assisted system that integrates theory driven reflective prompts with mechanisms for sharing teammates reflections. Informed by ten formative interviews, the system was evaluated in a mixed method study across three conditions: deeper reflection, regular reflection, and a control condition with unstructured reflection. Participants in the control condition demonstrated less deliberate thought and weaker collaboration, which led to stress and misalignment during team meetings. In contrast, structured reflection supported greater organization and steadier progress. The deeper reflection condition further facilitated confidence, teamwork, and idea generation, although it imposed a higher cognitive load. We conclude by discussing design implications for AI agents that facilitate reflection to enhance collaboration and broader considerations for AI assisted systems aimed at sustaining collaborative goals.",

Questions on its commercial potential become more pressing as the field becomes mature. To take the field one step further -- as the emergence of components contributed to the commercial development of graphical user interfaces -- this article suggests that applicative tangible user interfaces could also be split into components. These components are composed of the aggregation, combination, or coupling of physical items and fulfil four roles that are described through a new interaction model. This article successfully distributed among these four components' roles all of the 159 physical items from a representative collection of 35 applications. Further examination of these applicative tangible interfaces coincides with four research phases in the field and identifies three main paths for future research to fully realize the potential of tangible user interfaces.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.24166v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Increasing autonomous vehicles (AVs) in transportation systems makes effective interactions between AVs and pedestrians indispensable. External human--machine interface (eHMI), which employs visual or auditory cues to explicitly convey vehicle behaviors can compensate for the loss of human-like interactions and enhance AV--pedestrian cooperation. To facilitate faster intent convergence between pedestrian and AVs, this study incorporates an adaptive interaction mechanism into eHMI based on pedestrian intent recognition, namely IR-eHMI. IR-eHMI dynamically detects and infers the behavioral intentions of both pedestrians and AVs through identifying their cooperation states. The proposed interaction framework is implemented and evaluated on a virtual reality (VR) experimental platform to demonstrate its effectiveness through statistical analysis. Experimental results show that IR-eHMI significantly improves crossing efficiency, reduces gaze distraction while maintaining interaction safety compared to traditional fixed-distance eHMI. This adaptive and explicit interaction mode introduces an innovative procedural paradigm for AV--pedestrian cooperation.",

We set out to understand how people view deletion, the removal of material no longer needed: does it help by reducing clutter and improving the signal to noise ratio, or does the effort required to decide to delete something make it not worthwhile? How does deletion relate to other strategies like filing; do people who spend extensive time in filing also prune their materials too? We studied the behaviour of 51 knowledge workers though a series of questionnaires and interviews to evaluate a range of tactics they used aimed at organizing, filing, and retrieving digital resources. Our study reveals that deletion is consistently under-adopted compared to other tactics such as Filing, Coverage, Ontology, and Timeliness. Moreover, the empirical data indicate that deletion is actually detrimental to retrieval success and satisfaction. In this paper, we examine the practice of deletion, review the related literature, and present detailed statistical results and clustering outcomes that underscore its adverse effects.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.23859v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Online, people often recount their experiences turning to conversational AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) for mental health support -- going so far as to replace their therapists. These anecdotes suggest that AI agents have great potential to offer accessible mental health support. However, it's unclear how to meet this potential in extreme mental health crisis use cases. In this work, we explore the first-person experience of turning to a conversational AI agent in a mental health crisis. From a testimonial survey (n = 53) of lived experiences, we find that people use AI agents to fill the in-between spaces of human support; they turn to AI due to lack of access to mental health professionals or fears of burdening others. At the same time, our interviews with mental health experts (n = 16) suggest that human-human connection is an essential positive action when managing a mental health crisis. Using the stages of change model, our results suggest that a responsible AI crisis intervention is one that increases the user's preparedness to take a positive action while de-escalating any intended negative action. We discuss the implications of designing conversational AI agents as bridges towards human-human connection rather than ends in themselves.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.05041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We investigate recurrent neural networks with asymmetric interactions and demonstrate that the inclusion of self-couplings or sparse excitatory inter-module connections leads to the emergence of a densely connected manifold of dynamically accessible stable configurations. This representation manifold is exponentially large in system size and is reachable through simple local dynamics, despite constituting a subdominant subset of the global configuration space. We further show that learning can be implemented directly on this structure via a fully local, gradient-free mechanism that selectively stabilizes a single task-relevant network configuration. Unlike error-driven or contrastive learning schemes, this approach does not require explicit comparisons between network states obtained with and without output supervision. Instead, transient supervisory signals bias the dynamics toward the representation manifold, after which local plasticity consolidates the attained configuration, effectively shaping the latent representation space. Numerical evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks indicate performance comparable to that of multilayer perceptrons trained using backpropagation. More generally, these results suggest that the dynamical accessibility of fixed points and the stabilization of internal network dynamics constitute viable alternative principles for learning in recurrent systems, with conceptual links to statistical physics and potential implications for biologically motivated and neuromorphic computing architectures.",

Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.",

    "content": "arXiv:2404.12895v5 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the width of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed to cast the emergence of subjective temporal extension from first principles of the physics of self-organization and to formalize subjective temporal extension using information geometry. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two variations of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e., the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep states of meditative absorption (i.e., in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns, next to attentional and central tendency effects, the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, near death-experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the width of the subjective temporal moment emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.",

The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.24654v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Running is a fundamental form of human locomotion and a key task for evaluating neuromuscular control and lower-limb coordination. In recent years, muscle synergy analysis based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has become an important approach in this area. This review focuses on muscle synergies during running, outlining core neural control theories and biomechanical optimization hypotheses, summarizing commonly used decomposition methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, FA, NMF) and emerging autoencoder-based approaches. We synthesize findings on the development and evolution of running-related synergies across the lifespan, examine how running surface, speed, foot-strike pattern, fatigue, and performance level modulate synergy patterns, and describe characteristic alterations in populations with knee osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain, and stroke. Current evidence suggests that the number and basic structure of lower-limb synergies during running are relatively stable, whereas spatial muscle weightings and motor primitives are highly plastic and sensitive to task demands, fatigue, and pathology. However, substantial methodological variability remains in EMG channel selection, preprocessing pipelines, and decomposition algorithms, and direct neurophysiological validation and translational application are still limited. Future work should prioritize standardized processing protocols, integration of multi-source neuromusculoskeletal data, nonlinear modeling, and longitudinal intervention studies to better exploit muscle synergy analysis in sports biomechanics, athletic training, and rehabilitation medicine.",

Despite important advances, a full understanding of how such partial symmetry in connectivity shapes neural dynamics remains elusive. Here we ask how correlations between reciprocal connections in a random, recurrent neural network affect phase-space complexity, defined as the exponential proliferation rate (with network size) of the number of fixed points that accompanies the transition to chaotic dynamics. We find a striking pattern: partial anti-symmetry strongly amplifies complexity, while partial symmetry suppresses it. These opposing trends closely track changes in other measures of dynamical behavior, such as dimensionality, Lyapunov exponents, and transient path length, supporting the view that fixed-point structure is a key determinant of network dynamics. Thus, positive reciprocal correlations favor low-dimensional, slowly varying activity, whereas negative correlations promote high-dimensional, rapidly fluctuating chaotic activity. These results yield testable predictions about the link between connection reciprocity, neural dynamics and function.",

Likewise, it is also a central property of tasks to which we would like to apply artificial intelligence. It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms. The tool is modular, openly available and accessible to the research community.",

This paper bridges these two perspectives by designing spiking neural networks that simulate Bayesian inference through message passing for Bernoulli messages. To train the networks, we employ spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a biologically plausible mechanism for synaptic plasticity which is based on the Hebbian rule. Our results demonstrate that the network's performance closely matches the true numerical solution. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing a factor graph example from coding theory, illustrating signal transmission over an unreliable channel.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

    "title": "Social bodies: Preliminary evidence that awareness of embodied emotions is associated with recognition of emotions in the bodily cues of others.",
    "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Seventeen participants spent three consecutive nights at a sleep laboratory, where awakenings were scheduled to collect dream reports from both REM and NREM sleep. Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

This does 2 things: 1. obfuscates the code, 2. lets you do all sorts of wacky formatting. This isn't really useful for anything besides making ASCII art, but I think it's pretty fun.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What my project does?</h1> <p>I've been working in a monorepo managed with a <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/\">uv workspace</a> and ran into an annoying issue. When you build and publish an internal library that depends on another workspace member, the resulting wheel has no version constraint on that internal dependency.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/bilelomrani1/hatch-cada\">Cada</a> is a small hatchling plugin that fixes this. Cada resolves uv workspace members' versions at build time and adds proper version constraints to internal dependencies. You can choose different strategies: pin to exact version, allow patch updates, semver-style, etc.</p> <p>```toml [build-system] requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;, &quot;hatch-cada&quot;] build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;</p> <p>[project] name = &quot;my-client&quot; dependencies = [&quot;my-core&quot;]</p> <p>[tool.uv.sources] my-core = { workspace = true }</p> <p>[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.cada] strategy = &quot;allow-all-updates&quot; ```</p> <p>With the above configuration, the built wheel will declare a dependency on my-core&gt;=1.2.3. That way, you keep unversioned dependencies during development and get proper constraints automatically when you publish.</p> <h1>What is the intended audience?</h1> <p>This is for anyone distributing Python libraries from a uv workspace to PyPI (or any registry) to consumers outside of the workspace.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/carderne/una\"><strong>Una</strong></a> bundles all workspace dependencies into a single wheel. Great for applications you deploy yourself (Docker images, Lambda functions, CLI tools). Cada takes the opposite approach: each package keeps its own version and release cycle. It's meant for distributing libraries to users outside of the monorepo.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Opentrons/hatch-plugins/tree/main/hatch-dependency-coversion\"><strong>hatch-dependency-coversion</strong></a> rewrites dependency versions to match the current package's version (lockstep versioning). Cada resolves each dependency's actual version independently, each package can have it's own release cycle, but it also supports lockstep versioning if you want to. Cada simply reads your packages versions and does not make assumptions on your versioning strategy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/ninoseki/uv-dynamic-versioning\"><strong>uv-dynamic-versioning</strong></a> requires moving dependencies to a non-standard location with templating syntax. Cada keeps standard project.dependencies, so tools like Dependabot, pip-audit, and monorepo build tools (Nx, Moon) keep working out of the box.</p> <p>It's a narrow use case but happy to hear feedback or answer questions if some of you find it useful.</p> <p>Github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/bilelomrani1/hatch-cada\"> https://github.com/bilelomrani1/hatch-cada </a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bOmrani\"> /u/bOmrani </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q01ayz/cada_a_build_plugin_for_publishing_interdependent/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q01ayz/cada_a_build_plugin_for_publishing_interdependent/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "title": "Stable fusion of bone marrow-derived cells with Purkinje neurons enables long-term nuclear integration and neuronal repair",
    "content": "Developing effective strategies to replace or restore injured neurons could significantly revolutionise the treatment of currently incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Studies have shown that bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can migrate into the brain and fuse with damaged Purkinje neurons (PNs), restoring their structure and function. Yet, despite over two decades of research, the temporal dynamics and functional stability of these fusion events in vivo remain poorly defined, largely due to reliance on static, post-mortem histological analyses that provide only a single snapshot in time. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging of the intact cerebellum in EGFP-bone marrow chimeric mice, we visualised the dynamics of BMDC-PN interactions both in real time and longitudinally to monitor the physiological characteristics of fused PNs. Notably, we provide definitive evidence that fused cells are not transient but remain stable over extended periods in the living brain. Moreover, we demonstrate sustained transcriptional activity of donor-derived genes within fused PNs, indicating partial or complete functional integration of the BMDC nucleus. Given their accessibility and genetic tractability, BMDCs represent a practical and promising platform for targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to PNs, opening new avenues for treating neurodegenerative disease.",

    "title": "Distinct neural processing of real versus unreal optic flow in the human brain",
    "content": "Visual perception of self-movement relies on optic flow, a global motion pattern generated by self-movement in a rigid 3D environment. Such optic flow conveys both 2D features (e.g., radial velocity fields and centers of motion) and 3D structural information (e.g., motion perspective). However, many previous neuroimaging studies have used simplified 2D radial motion as \"real\" optic flow, leaving it unclear whether such \"unreal\" stimuli adequately capture how the brain processes ecologically valid self-movement information. Previous behavioral work has shown that sensitivity to expansion and contraction reverses depending on whether optic flow is ecologically valid (L. Li et al., 2025), raising the question of how such differences are represented in the human brain. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to systematically compare cortical processing of real versus unreal optic flow. The two stimulus types were strictly matched in 2D global features and local motion signals, differing only in whether they preserved 3D structure consistent with self-movement. To minimize task-related influences, participants performed a task-irrelevant fixation point color-change detection task during scanning. Experiment 1 used a block design in which participants viewed expanding and contracting optic flow at different motion coherence levels. Experiment 2 presented real and unreal optic flow within the same scanning session to directly test neural sensitivity to ecological validity. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed that, among multiple visual and optic flow-responsive regions, the human dorsal medial superior temporal area (MST) exhibited robust and consistent sensitivity to the ecological validity of optic flow. Specifically, under real optic flow, decoding accuracy for motion coherence in MST was significantly higher for expansion than for contraction, whereas this preference was reversed under unreal optic flow. Neural threshold estimates derived from fMR-metric functions further supported this pattern reversal, indicating systematic modulation of MST sensitivity by ecological structure. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that, regardless of motion pattern, MST reliably distinguished real from unreal optic flow, with decoding accuracy increasing as motion coherence increased. These findings indicate that MST encodes not only motion patterns themselves but also whether optic flow conforms to the ecological structure of self-movement. Together, these results indicate that MST responses are not determined solely by 2D radial motion features, but are modulated by whether optic flow preserves 3D structure consistent with self-movement. This work clarifies a long-standing conflation between simplified radial motion and real optic flow and highlights the importance of ecological structure in shaping dorsal-stream motion representations related to self-movement perception.",

    "title": "Volume Electron Microscopy of Cortical Organoids: Methods for Region Identification, Connectome Reconstruction, and Organelle Segmentation",
    "content": "Volume electron microscopy (vEM) has become a powerful tool for 3D ultrastructural analysis of neural circuits, yet its application to human brain organoids remains limited, particularly for connectomic studies. Here, we established a comprehensive and scalable workflow for applying vEM to human cortical organoids, integrating correlative light and electron microscopy, large-area SEM mosaic imaging, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) validation. By systematically comparing two embedding protocols in use, we demonstrated that the DeFelipe and Fairen (1993)/Cano-Astorga et al. (2024) method provides optimal compatibility with toluidine blue-stained semithin sectioning and enables reliable synapse segmentation and neurite tracing. In contrast, the Deerinck et al. (2010) protocol offers enhanced membrane contrast but limits postsynaptic density visualization. Using FIB-SEM imaging of peripheral, neuropil-like regions of cortical organoids, we achieved accurate 3D reconstruction of synapses, neurites and intracellular organelles, enabling quantitative assessment of synaptic apposition surfaces, neurite trajectories, and organelle distribution across defined cellular compartments. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of micro-connectomic reconstruction in human cortical organoids at nanometer resolution. This methodological framework expands the applicability of vEM to organoid systems and provides a robust foundation for future studies of human brain development, disease modeling, and therapeutic evaluation at the synaptic and subcellular level.",

    "title": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) induce dose-dependent neonatal ventriculomegaly following intracerebroventricular administration",
    "content": "Cell-type-speci[fi]c expression of synthetic/endogenous proteins or genetic sequences has signi[fi]cantly advanced our understanding of the central nervous system (CNS). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivery to cerebrospinal [fl]uid (CSF) mediates transfection of target cells to enable sustained delivery of secretory proteins into the CSF, o[ff]ering promising avenues for both CNS therapy and mechanistic studies. However, despite the advantages afforded by AAV tropism-based cellular selectivity and transgene delivery, both preclinical studies and clinical trials report short- and long-term adverse e[ff]ects, particularly immune activation. Especially relevant for CSF biology, CNS immune insults raise the risk of CSF dysregulation, including hydrocephalus. These risks may be exacerbated in pediatric populations, where ongoing CNS development, including immature meninges, choroid plexus (ChP), and skull structures, may further impair any ability to compensate for CSF dysregulation. To systematically address these risks and provide guidelines for minimizing CNS immune insults by AAVs, we test the dose-dependent e[ff]ects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of 3 AAV serotypes (AAV2/5, AAV2/4, and AAV.PHP.eB) to neonatal (P0.5) CD1 mouse pups. Histological analysis veri[fi]ed AAV2/5 tropism limited to ChP epithelial cells (CPECs), whereas AAV.PHP.eB transfected both CPECs and ependymal regions. By contrast, AAV2/4 shows limited transfection in the brain. Further, we [fi]nd that ICV injections of all 3 AAV serotypes at the high dose (4x109 genome copy GC/pup) induced ventriculomegaly by P7.5, while the low dose (1x109 GC/pup) was well tolerated. Additionally, high-dose AAV2/5 tropism became more permissive, transfecting the ChP and also ependymal cells and some neurons. Longitudinal MRI of P0.5 pups with high-dose AAV2/5 ICV injections highlighted quick progression of ventriculomegaly. CSF ELISA analysis detected elevated proin[fl]ammatory cytokine CCL2 in AAV2/5 and AAV2/4 high-dose groups, indicating CNS inflammation. Moreover, decreased CSF TTR concentrations in high-dose groups suggest ChP dysfunction. We further revealed that earlier in utero high-dose ICV AAV2/5 injections at E13.5 induced even more severe ventriculomegaly and that adult animals were also susceptible to ventriculomegaly after high-dose AAV ICV delivery. Taken together, our data emphasize critical safety considerations of CSF-based AAV delivery, particularly during brain development. Further, these results call for an optimized dosage for perinatal ICV AAV applications.",

    "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "title": "Rescuing Neurodevelopmental Deficits in AMPA Receptor Gain-of-Function Mutant",
    "content": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission and are essential for neuronal development and brain function. We investigated the role of a recurrent variant in the AMPAR GluA1 subunit (GRIA1 p.A636T) identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). To test causality and mechanism, we generated a Gria1-A636T knock-in mouse model. Mutant mice exhibited core ASD/ID-like behaviors and a selective hippocampal vulnerability characterized by progressive dendritic atrophy and neuronal loss. Despite reduced GluA1-containing complexes, AMPARs displayed synaptic hyperexcitability and failed to undergo the normal postnatal transition to calcium-impermeable AMPARs, resulting in persistent excitotoxicity. To explore therapeutic intervention, we designed an allele-specific antisense oligonucleotide to specifically silence the mutant transcript. A single neonatal administration of the antisense oligonucleotide entirely prevented hippocampal pathology and ameliorated behavioral deficits. These findings establish GRIA1-A636T as a gain-of-function mutation that drives developmental excitotoxicity and highlight the potential of RNA-targeted precision medicine for neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "content": "The impact of different neuropathologies on deep brain structures remains to be understood. In this study, we investigate subcortical and limbic volumetry in neurodegenerative diseases involving concomitant co-pathologies (p-tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43). We acquired neuropathological measures and brain segmentations from ex vivo postmortem analysis of 132 donors with Alzheimer disease (AD; n=60), Lewy body disease (LBD; n=26), Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP; n=21) and FTLD-Tau (n=25). Compared with AD and LBD, individuals with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau exhibited significantly reduced thalamic and striatal volumes. Disease-specific cortico-subcortical and cortico-limbic associations were observed: AD showed widespread cortico-subcortical and cortico-limbic morphometric associations, whereas LBD demonstrated more restricted parieto-occipital cortical-limbic associations. FTLD-TDP was characterized by predominant cortico-subcortical associations, while FTLD-Tau showed stronger cortico-limbic coupling. Pathology/structure analyses revealed that in AD and FTLD-Tau, hippocampal volume was associated with p-tau burden, neuronal loss, and gliosis. In LBD, thalamic alpha-synuclein severity was associated with both subcortical and limbic volumes, whereas no significant volumetric associations with TDP-43 burden were detected in FTLD-TDP. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct structure-structure and structure-pathology relationships across neurodegenerative diseases and highlight the value of ex vivo postmortem neuroimaging for disentangling disease-specific patterns of deep brain vulnerability.",

    "content": "Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests spatial memory impairment and tau accumulation in the entorhinal cortex (EC). However, how EC neural activity contributes to memory deficits in tauopathy remains unclear. Here, we combined in vivo two-photon calcium imaging with virtual reality to examine medial EC (MEC) activity in PS19 tauopathy mice during 10 days of spatial learning. PS19 males exhibited pronounced learning deficits and their MEC neurons showed impaired speed modulation, unstable spatial encoding, and weakened representations in cue-poor relative to cue-rich regions, suggesting disrupted path integration. These deficits were most prominent in pyramidal cells, which accumulated higher levels of phosphorylated tau than stellate cells, particularly in males. Notably, MEC activity robustly predicted learning performance, especially via non-grid and pyramidal cells, and distinguished PS19 from wild-type mice. Together, these findings identify MEC dysfunction as a key neural correlate of spatial memory decline in AD-related tauopathy, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

    "content": "Immune-mediated inflammatory processes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, immune loci exhibit significant sequence diversity, with human proteins sharing only 45% to 70% identity with their murine orthologs. This divergence contributes to the inability of many established mouse models to accurately capture key neuroinflammatory mechanisms relevant to human AD. We recently identified that the human, but not murine, immunomodulatory protein B71 (CD80) activates the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), a function arising from evolutionary divergence in human B71. This discovery provides an opportunity to directly interrogate the role of this interaction in disease progression using a well-characterized murine model of mutant A{beta} overexpression (CRND8). We generated a mouse line in which murine B71 was replaced with a chimeric human:murine B71 that retains normal interactions with CTLA-4 and CD28, while gaining the ability to bind p75, and evaluated its effects in CRND8 mice. Expression of human:murine B71 in vivo resulted in increased lethality, accelerated neuroinflammation of resident glia, more rapid synaptic and dendritic loss, and enhanced microvascular compromise in the subiculum compared to CRND8 mice expressing murine B71. Together, these findings identify the human B71:p75 interaction as a previously unrecognized contributor to AD pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target in a brain region critical for learning and memory that is affected in early stages of disease.",

    "title": "Memory schema reorganization induced by the deliberate processing in the executive network supported by widespread amplified activity",
    "content": "Schema accommodation is the reorganization of a preexisting memory schema to deeply accept new information incongruent with it. Although it is crucial for flexible intelligence, it occurs infrequently, making its neural basis difficult to study. To overcome this, we conducted an fMRI experiment using a newly developed experimental paradigm, the reversal description task. The results suggest that the schema changes that occurred during the task were global reorganizations rather than local adjustments. Moreover, the executive network responsible for deliberate processing played a central role, with the support of widespread amplified activity. Furthermore, reinforcement learning-based control implemented in these neural substrates, in cooperation with the caudate nucleus, emerged as a candidate mechanism for the deliberative schema update. These findings indicate that memory reorganization involves not only automatic but also deliberate processes, in which the desired global structure is explored through the control operation performed by these neural bases.",

    "title": "Discovery of Abundant Nano-scale Lymphatic-like Vessels in Brains",
    "content": "As one of the most metabolically active organs, the high metabolic demands of the brain require a highly efficient system for waste clearance. However, it remains unclear whether the brain possesses such an efficient system, and if so, what are the features of the system. Over a decade ago, a glymphatic system was proposed to describe neurofluid transport through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and perivascular spaces (PVS), complemented by dural and meningeal lymphatic pathways. Nonetheless, it is still elusive whether transport within the CSF and PVS occurs as a structured form of flow. Moreover, unlike the abundance of blood capillaries in the brain, only a low density of lymphatic vessels has been observed. Such a low density of lymphatic vessels is unlikely to support the level of efficiency required for effective metabolic waste clearance in the brain. By combining expansion microscopic imaging with CRANAD-3, a pan-beta-amyloid fluorescence probe, we discovered abundant nano-scale lymphatic-like vessels (NLVs) in the brain parenchyma of both mouse and human. The majority of these vessels have diameters less than 1000 nanometers and show moderate positivity for several lymphatic biomarkers, including LYVE-1, Prox-1, PDPN, and VEGFR3. The NLVs coil around blood vessels and possible connections between blood vessels were observed. Notably, we also found that some NLVs travel through several layers in the cortex and display distinct orientation patterns in different cortical layers. Our discovery reveals a previously hidden vascular system, and raises the possibility that such an abundant and structured web of tubular structures could enable highly efficient means to enhance waste clearance, and could thus play a crucial role in supporting the high metabolic demands of brains.",

    "title": "Ciliary sensing in tanycytes couples nutrient availability to metabolic regulation",
    "content": "Body homeostasis relies on accurate communication between the brain and the periphery. Disruption of this communication can contribute to disease. Tanycytes are located at the interface of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bloodstream, and hypothalamus, where they sense circulating nutrients and regulate neuroendocrine axes and metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which they sense CSF signals remain largely unclear. Recent evidence that tanycytes possess primary cilia -- key sensory organelles -- led us to hypothesize that tanycytic cilia function as sensory antennae that detect metabolic cues in the CSF. Here, we demonstrate that tanycytic cilia exhibit distinct morphologies across subtypes and physiological states. They respond dynamically to hormonal and nutrient availability; notably, excess oleic acid shortens cilia, promotes lipid droplet accumulation, and reduces Ca2+ responses to ATP and glucose. Disrupting cilia via knockdown of intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes produced similar defects and impaired autophagy. Finally, selective Ift88 knockout in tanycytes increased body weight and reduced thermogenic activity in female mice. These findings identify tanycytic cilia as key sensors regulating energy balance.",

    "title": "Fast and slow architectures of cortical dynamics in human brain",
    "content": "The most critical attribute of the brain is its ability to coordinate perception, thoughts, and action across different timescales. A prominent theory holds that the cortex is organized along a unidimensional hierarchy, where higher-order regions operate over longer intrinsic timescales than sensory areas, a view inferred from analytical methods that assume a single, dominant timescale per region. However, whether cortical dynamics are governed by such a singular hierarchy, or instead by multiple concurrent timescales, has remained unclear due to this fundamental methodological constraint. Here, developing an assumption-free spectral analysis of human intracranial recordings, we discover a fundamental dissociation: cortical dynamics are organized into a fast spectral component (~10-100 Hz) and a slow component (<~1-10 Hz). Crucially, only the fast component spatially recapitulates the classic sensory-to-transmodal functional gradient, whereas the slow component lacks gradient and is coupled to cardiac-related neural activity. This dual-timescale architecture, stable across distinct conscious states, demonstrates human cortical dynamics are organized into parallel processing channels, not a single temporal hierarchy. This framework provides a new foundation for understanding dynamical subsystems that link to brain physiology and cognition.",

    "title": "Symmetry constraints on feedback-driven orientation tuning dynamics in translation-invariant models of primate V1",
    "content": "Orientation selectivity in primate V1 is shaped by feedforward drive, intracortical recurrence, and corticocortical feedback. Yet a basic conceptual question remains: what aspects of orientation tuning can (or cannot) be altered by a recurrent/feedback loop that is rotationally symmetric in cortical space? We develop a minimal translation-invariant linear field model in which stimulus drive and recurrent interactions are analyzed in the spatial Fourier domain (k,{phi}). Our central analytic result is an exact symmetry constraint: for any temporally filtered but isotropic recurrent coupling W0(k,{omega}), the response at fixed (k,{omega}) is multiplied by an angle-independent complex gain. Consequently, any normalized orientation metric computed at fixed k--including circular variance, orientation selectivity index (OSI), and bandwidth--is invariant under isotropic recurrence. Isotropic recurrence can nevertheless rescale gain and select a spatial band through its k-dependence. We then show that adding a weak anisotropic component, especially when endowed with a slower timescale than a fast isotropic pathway, produces delayed sharpening and modest preferred-angle drifts. A perturbative calculation predicts linear scaling of tuning changes with anisotropy strength, and a simple phasor-sum formula explains {phi}*(t) drift when feedforward and feedback anisotropies compete. We provide stability criteria for the temporally filtered (auxiliary-variable) implementation and verify them numerically. Finally, we identify concrete regimes in which isotropic recurrence can alter measured tuning in practice, including finite-k readouts with k-dependent feedforward anisotropy and nonlinear (tuned) divisive-normalization readouts. Together these results sharpen a null hypothesis for perturbation experiments and delineate the minimal feature-specific ingredients required to explain dynamic tuning in macaque V1.",

    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "title": "Kinematic fields of the visuo-hippocampal circuit",
    "content": "The structure of focused receptive fields in retinotopic and allocentric space in the visual cortex and hippocampus is studied extensively to understand cognitive functions such as stimulus tracking and path-integration, respectively. These functions require accurate tracking of running speed and acceleration. While speed dependence in these areas is well-studied, acceleration-dependence has received little attention, and the joint effect of speed-acceleration is unknown. Hence, we assessed the joint influence of these kinematic variables by computing receptive fields in a novel, 2D, phase space of speed-acceleration using the Allen Brain Visual Observatory data. Head-fixed mice ran spontaneously on a running wheel next to a monocular gray screen ensuring virtually no changes in the retinotopic or allocentric space. Remarkably, about half (44.3%, 6590/14862) of neurons in the visuo-hippocampal circuit (from LGN to subiculum) were significantly modulated by a specific combination of speed and acceleration to form receptive fields in the speed-acceleration phase space (called kinematic space). The prevalence of kinematic tuning is comparable to the fraction of place cells in the mouse hippocampus, and the fraction of visually tuned neurons in higher visual areas. The kinematic field size (~30% of the sampled space) was also comparable to the place field size. Kinematic fields spanned the entire space but preferred either low-speed, high-acceleration or the high-speed, low-acceleration segments. Although pupil size too varied spontaneously, the kinematic tuning exceeded pupil size tuning in all brain areas. Surprisingly, pupil size modulated the activity of ~20% of hippocampal neurons, which was comparable to that in LGN and visual cortical areas. Thus, all visuo-hippocampal areas have focused kinematic fields that are three times more prevalent than the pupil size fields in the absence of any vestibular, visual or spatial stimuli. This kinematic phase space could interface with retinotopic and allocentric spaces to guide natural behaviors involving movement.",

    "title": "Friendship modulates physical effort and neural dynamics during group coordination in shared social networks",
    "content": "Human social interactions are embedded within social networks, yet it remains unclear how existing interpersonal relationships influence the behavioural and neural dynamics of collective action. Here, we combined social network mapping with three-person EEG hyperscanning to investigate how friendships in shared networks modulate interpersonal coordination. We mapped social networks across seven undergraduate cohorts (N = 378) and recruited a subset of participants (N = 93) that consisted of triads of two mutually close friends and one non-friend from the same network. Triads performed a novel joint motor task in which participants produced forces towards a collective target. Non-friends consistently produced greater and more vigorous force than friends during joint action. This effect was strongest for non-friends embedded in smaller social networks. At the neural level, non-friends exhibited stronger alpha- and beta-band event-related desynchronization, higher inter-subject correlation, and increased inter-brain group phase synchrony. These neural signatures are consistent with increased action preparation, prediction, and attentional engagement during coordination. Taken together, these findings indicate that friendship and social network context are reflected in how individuals allocate physical effort and engage during collective action, and suggest that non-friends work harder and allocate more attention during joint tasks to compensate for the disparity in social standing. By linking real-world social relationships to behavioural and multi-brain neural dynamics, this work demonstrates that relational context is embodied in the mechanisms supporting human group coordination.",

    "title": "STAT1-Mediated Regulation of IL-17A/CEBPB/NF-\u03baB Axisin HIV-1 Infected Human Cerebral Organoids RevealsTherapeutic Targets for Neuroprotection",
    "content": "HIV-associated neurological complications remain a major concern in people living with HIV (PLWH), even under effective viral suppression with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), underscoring unresolved mechanisms driving HIV-related neurodegeneration. To address this gap, we used HIV-1-infected human cerebral organoids (hCOs) containing microglia as a physiologically relevant three-dimensional model of the central nervous system (CNS) and validated key findings in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected, cART-treated rhesus macaque model. Integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing with ATAC sequencing, we identified cell-type-specific alterations in dual innate immune-driven inflammatory signaling pathways across neural and glial populations. Microglia were preferentially infected and activated, initiating IL-17A-mediated cascades involving IFN{gamma}, STAT1, CEBPB, and NFkB pathways, which converged with cGAS-STING and Notch-NEURL1 signaling, both associated with neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. cART suppressed viral replication, reduced IL-17A-driven neuroinflammation, improved mitochondrial function, and restored synaptic gene expression. Collectively, these findings identify IL-17A, STAT1, CEBPB, and cGAS-STING as key molecular drivers of HIV-associated neuroinflammation and establish a novel mechanistic link between IL-17A signaling and microglial remodeling, providing a translational framework for the development of CNS-targeted therapies in PLWH.",

    "title": "Cortical potentials evoked by stimulation of cervical vagus vs. auricular nerve: a comparative, parametric study in nonhuman primates",
    "content": "Stimulation of sensory vagal pathways is typically delivered via invasive, cervical vagus nerve stimulation (cVNS) or noninvasive, trans-auricular nerve stimulation (taNS). While both methods are investigated therapeutically, their effects on brain physiology remain poorly understood, hindering mechanistic understanding and stimulus optimization. In 6 awake nonhuman primates, we recorded cortical vagal-evoked potentials (VEPs) from subdural electrodes placed in prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal cortical areas, in response to cVNS or taNS. Across 478 different taNS and cVNS protocols, we varied stimulation side, intensity, frequency, pulse count, and pulse width (PW) and assessed independent effects on amplitude and latency of early (EC; 30-100 ms), intermediate (IC; 101-200 ms) and late components (LC; 201-500 ms) of VEPs. Fixed and random effects of stimulation parameters and subjects, respectively, on VEP measurements, were assessed using a linear mixed-effects model. Overall, cVNS elicits more robust VEPs than taNS, with larger EC, IC and LC amplitudes in both hemispheres. cVNS-elicited ECs and LCs are largest in PFC and PC areas, whereas ICs are largest in SM areas. On the other hand, taNS generally does not elicit area-specific responses. cVNS-elicited ECs have slower latency than ta-NS elicited ECs. Higher stimulation frequencies and intensities and a longer pulse width elicit larger ECs and ICs for cVNS, and to some extent for taNS. Both short and long cVNS trains elicit stronger ECs, and long trains elicit slower ICs. Earlobe stimulation elicits VEPs that partially overlap with those from taNS. In conclusion, cVNS and taNS elicit cortical VEPs in a manner consistent with distinct engagement of ascending vagal pathways, and with similarities and differences in the effects of stimulation parameters on evoked responses.",

    "title": "Fractal memory structure in the spatiotemporal learning rule",
    "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "title": "Creating a world in the head: The conscious apprehension of neural content originating from internal sources.",
    "content": "Klein et al. (2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "title": "Cell-type-specific adaptations to mitochondrial stress underly the neurological presentations of \tMTRFR mutations",
    "content": "Mitochondrial diseases are a group of heterogeneous genetic disorders that exhibit striking tissue specificity. Neurological involvement is among the most consistent features, yet the mechanisms that determine why selective neuronal populations are particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction remain poorly understood. Mutations in MTRFR, a mitochondrial ribosome rescue factor, cause a progressive neuromuscular phenotype, but no relevant disease model exists to explain its cell-type-specific pathology. Here, we established the first human iPSC-derived neuronal model of MTRFR loss and identified mechanisms driving differential vulnerability between cortical and motor neurons. Although knockdown led to comparable deficits in mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS across both subtypes, cortical neurons engaged adaptive programs, including dendritic mitochondrial remodeling and heat-shock response activation, that preserved survival. Motor neurons failed to mount these responses and instead displayed apoptotic and inflammatory priming. Pharmacological enhancement of stress adaptation rescued motor neuron survival, indicating that resilience is programmable. These findings provide the first mechanistic evidence that neuronal susceptibility to mitochondrial translation defects is defined by the capacity to activate mitochondrial and cytoprotective stress-response pathways.",

    "title": "Multi-modal choroid plexus pathology in aging and Alzheimer's disease",
    "content": "Brain barriers, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, and peripheral factors are implicated as significant contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The choroid plexus (ChP) is a blood-brain interface that produces CSF and forms the blood-CSF barrier. However, how ChP pathology develops across the lifespan and contributes to AD has not been systematically characterized. Here, we report a multi-modal ChP atlas integrating single-nucleus transcriptomics from 49 individuals, AI-assisted quantitative histopathology across >500 postmortem samples age 16 to 105, spatial transcriptomics, and functional studies in 5xFAD mice. We identify fibrosis, calcification, and macrophage abnormalities as hallmarks of ChP aging, with AD pathology conferring additional effects, including expansion of a pro-inflammatory fibroblast-macrophage signaling niche. In 5xFAD mice, macrophage dysfunction is associated with impaired epithelial barrier maintenance and repair. Together, these data provide a foundational resource for understanding ChP dysfunction in aging and AD and propose the macrophage-fibroblast-epithelial barrier axis as a driver of ChP pathology.",

    "title": "Ultrastructural changes at auditory nerve synapses following moderate noise exposure",
    "content": "Moderate noise exposure is a common experience, yet its impact on central auditory synapses remains poorly understood. We study this issue at the first synapses in the central auditory pathway formed by auditory nerve afferents onto bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus, called endbulbs of Held. Non-traumatic noise exposure alters endbulb properties, decreasing the probability of vesicle release and enlarging the pool of releasable vesicles as assessed using electrophysiological methods and immunolabelling. These changes appear homeostatic, to maintain synaptic efficacy during periods of high activity. To identify structural changes underlying the larger vesicle pool, we used serial blockface electron microscopy of endbulbs from control and noise-exposed mice to quantitatively assess synaptic morphology. We observed no differences in the juxtapositional area between endbulbs and bushy cells, nor in the number or density of active zones and postsynaptic densities. Images of endbulb terminals were significantly darker after noise exposure, indicating an increase in the density of synaptic vesicles. These results suggest that moderate noise exposure induces an activity-dependent increase in presynaptic vesicle numbers, consistent with the observed physiological changes in neurotransmitter release. This work sets the stage for high-resolution studies to quantify docked and reserve vesicles.",

    "title": "Retrograde viral delivery of hyper-IL-6 activates Stat3 in corticospinal tract neurons but causes severe tremors and weight loss in adult mice",
    "content": "Cytokines in the IL-6 family can improve axon regeneration after nervous system injury, acting in part by stimulating Stat3 phosphorylation and pro-regenerative signaling in injured neurons. Hyper-IL-6 (hIL-6) is an engineered ligand with enhanced signaling properties, shown previously to stimulate axon growth even more effectively than native IL-6 family members. Here we tested a method of hIL-6 delivery based on injection of retrograde AAV to the cervical spinal cord of adult mice. This was envisioned as a first step toward a regenerative treatment after spinal cord injury based on widespread stimulation of descending projection neurons. We found, however, that animals treated with AAV2-retro-hIL-6 developed severe tremors and weight loss within days of injection and reached criteria for humane euthanasia within five to eleven days, depending on viral dose. Examination of the cortex showed a pronounced increase in Stat3 phosphorylation in corticospinal tract (CST) neurons in hIL-6 animals versus control, confirming effective retrograde signaling. Stat3 phosphorylation and evidence of microglial activation were detected in tissue surrounding CST cell bodies and along descending CST axons, revealing extensive cytokine signaling and microglial response associated with secreted hIL-6. These results confirm the ability of hIL-6 expression to activate Stat3 signaling in CST neurons but uncover the potential for severe negative effects that must inform any further development of hIL-6 as a pro-regenerative therapeutic.",

    "title": "Histone Demethylase KDM6B Promotes Postnatal Oligodendrocyte Development and Cortical Myelination",
    "content": "Myelination in the postnatal cortex requires epigenetic programs that activate oligodendrocyte gene networks. Here we show that the histone H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B promotes this process in vivo. Conditional Kdm6b deletion (Kdm6b-cKO) in Emx1 dorsal telencephalic progenitors caused delayed cortical myelination. Lineage-specific RNA-seq revealed that the oligodendrocyte master regulator Sox10 was significantly reduced, as well as myelination effectors, indicating impaired oligodendrocyte maturation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the same lineage showed increased H3K27me3 at promoter-proximal regions of Sox10, consistent with loss of KDM6B-mediated de-repression. Temporally controlled Sox10 induction partially rescued myelination in Kdm6b-cKO mice. These findings define a KDM6B[-&gt;]SOX10 axis that licenses oligodendrocyte development and cortical myelination by removing repressive H3K27me3 and sustaining active chromatin, with implications for KDM6B-related neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "title": "Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage has distinct effects on myelinated axons in the fimbria and on behaviors related to neurodevelopmental disorders in mice.",
    "content": "The hemizygous deletion of human chromosome 22q11.2 leads to cognitive and social deficits, as well as psychiatric disorders. Constitutive deletion of Tbx1, a T-box transcription factor gene encoded within this chromosomal region, results in deficits in various cognitive and social behaviors and altered formation of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and myelinated axons in the fimbria of adult mice. Given that Tbx1 is present in neonatal stem cells and oligodendrocytes, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage contributes to behavioral phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and ultrastructural changes in myelinated axons in the fimbria. To this end, we conditionally induced Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage in PdgfrCre;Tbx1+/flox mice. This mouse line showed recombination in brain regions known to express Pdgfra. Male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice performed better in spontaneous alternation in a T-maze than wild-type littermates at 1, but not 2 months of age; otherwise, mutant and wild-type littermates were indistinguishable in neonatal ultrasonic vocalization, peripubertal and postpubertal social interaction, novel object approach, anxiety-related behaviors in an elevated plus maze, and motor activity and thigmotaxis in an inescapable open field. The fimbria of male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice showed an increase in the number of myelinated axons in a range between 300 nm and 800 nm diameter and a decrease in the myelinated axons around 1,200 nm and 1,400 nm; the thickness of myelin was unchanged across all diameters. Our findings show that Tbx1 heterozygosity in oligodendrocyte precursor cells or their progeny selectively improves spontaneous alternation and shifts the proportion of myelinated axons toward small- to medium-sized axons, suggesting that the compositional shift in axons in the fimbria induced by Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage might underlie improved cognition relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "title": "Drinking microstructure analysis of direct controls of water intake in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Measures of rodent drinking (lick) patterns are used to test how various manipulations affect fluid intake. Decades of research indicate that manipulating the satiating potency of a stimulus affects the number of licking bursts whereas manipulating the hedonic value of the solution affects the size of the licking bursts or rate of licking. This type of analysis has been largely applied to manipulations that modulate drinking that is already occurring (i.e., indirect controls or modulators of intake), but there is a dearth of studies with detailed measures of licking in response to stimuli that are primary drivers of intake (i.e., direct controls). A better understanding of licking behavior in response to direct controls of fluid intake could provide insight into how drinking is stimulated. Accordingly, we analyzed lick patterns after varying doses of primary drivers (direct controls) of intake, angiotensin II, hypertonic saline, or carbochol, in male and female rats. As expected, all treatments dose-dependently increased licks for water. Analysis of licking patterns revealed dose-related increases in burst number after treatment with all stimuli, but dose did not predict burst size or lick rate. Together with previous work on licking patterns these data suggest that direct controls of water intake are more related to processes associated with satiety than to changes in hedonic value of the consumed substance.",

    "title": "Retinal Origins of Circadian Photoregulation's Specialized Dynamic Range and Temporal Integration",
    "content": "The circadian clock allows organisms to anticipate environmental changes that are driven by the earth's rotation, and synchronizes with this cycle using ligh1. The clock extracts relevant parameters of illumination, responding selectively to intensities at twilight and above, and to the number of photons counted over an extended time window2-8. These hallmark properties are thought to manifest in the brain9. Here, we report that they emerge within specific neurons of the eye. These M1 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) detect light directly, using a receptor called melanopsin, and indirectly, through circuits driven by rod and cone photoreceptors10. We find that the balance of intrinsic and extrinsic drives varies widely across M1s, and the population accounts for the dynamic range of circadian photoregulation. Both singly and collectively, M1s approach the level of temporal integration observed behaviorally. The cellular and behavioral levels match when the pupillary light reflex--another M1-driven function--shapes the light that M1s receive. This work reveals how the first steps of sensory processing are precisely formatted for specific tasks. It also introduces bioluminescence-based methods for identifying photosensitive neurons without desensitization, allowing their mechanistic study under physiological conditions.",

    "title": "Lateralized foraging induces asymmetric corticostriatal plasticity in mice",
    "content": "With practice, animals perform reward-oriented actions faster and with less variability. The dorsal striatum (DS) plays a key role in this process, potentially through opposing changes in cortical input strength to the two main striatal projection neurons (D1- and D2-SPNs). To test this hypothesis, we trained mice in a foraging task requiring them to perform quarter-turns (QTs) in a single direction (counterclockwise, CCW) along the walls of square towers to collect drops of water. As training progressed, the number and speed of CCW QTs increased while the variability of their trajectory decreased. Whisker trimming in well-trained mice altered QTs kinematics, highlighting the role of tactile inputs in guiding these actions. Combining ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in the DS with glutamate uncaging in the barrel cortex, we mapped the cortical neurons monosynaptically connected to D1- or D2-SPNs and measured the strength of these connections in the contralateral hemispheres, relative to the turn direction. In well-trained mice, compared to naive controls, the contralateral hemisphere showed no major changes in D1- or D2-SPNs connectivity, despite increased excitation of cortical pyramidal neurons. In contrast, the ipsiversive hemisphere exhibited no change in cortical excitability but showed increased cortical connectivity and input strength to SPNs. These findings reveal an unexpected hemispheric asymmetry in corticostriatal connectivity during lateralized foraging, which may reflect a homeostatic process normalizing striatal activity across hemispheres despite unbalanced cortical input.",

    "title": "Real-time Bayesian optimization of deep brain stimulation for personalized cognitive control enhancement",
    "content": "Background: Identifying effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameters for psychiatric disorders has historically been a time-consuming and error prone process due to a lack of an objective and rapid readout of target circuit engagement. Cognitive control may have use as a biomarker of treatment efficacy but it has yet to be shown that DBS parameters can be reliably optimized to produce cognitive control improvements in individual subjects. Objective: We sought to leverage a rat model of DBS-driven cognitive control improvements to determine whether state of the art optimization algorithms could consistently identify effective stimulation amplitudes to enhance cognition. Methods: We delivered periods of active and inactive DBS-like stimulation at variable parameters while rats performed a Set-Shifting task that we previously showed to be stimulation-sensitive. We tested both predefined settings of interest and settings that were personalized to individual animals using Bayesian Optimization. Measurements of task performance including reaction time and accuracy were compared between acute, optimized, and traditional settings to evaluate effects on cognitive control. Results: Acute stimulation reduced reaction times without hindering accuracy (N=15), replicating the effects previously observed with chronic stimulation. In a second cohort (N=6), optimization of stimulation amplitude successfully reduced reaction times in all animals with comparable effect size to historically best settings. Conclusion: These findings confirm that optimization techniques can be effective for improving symptomatically-relevant cognitive markers supporting the feasibility of personalized, quantitatively-informed approaches to neuromodulation and target engagement for psychiatric and/or cognitive disorders.",

    "title": "Inducible CreERT2 mouse lines for characterization of retinal bipolar cell subtypes",
    "content": "Bipolar cells relay visual signals from photoreceptor cells to ganglion cells in the retina. Fifteen bipolar cell subtypes have been identified in the mouse retina. These subtypes are classified as ON and OFF bipolar cells based on their response to light stimulus or rod and cone bipolar cells based on their connection to photoreceptor cells. However, the unique structural and functional role of these subtypes in the processing of visual information is not fully known due to the inadequate tools and models available for their characterization. In this study, to trace the lineage and characterize Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4-expressing bipolar cell subtypes in developing and adult mouse retina, we developed inducible Cre lines under the promoter of Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 and crossed them with ChR2EYFP reporter mice. Lineages of cells expressing Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 after Cre induction in the adult and postnatal mouse retina were then characterized. ChR2EYFP expression driven by Vsx1-CreERT2 was detected in type 2, 6, and 7 bipolar cells, Lhx3-CreERT2 in type 1b, 2, and 6 bipolar cells, and Lhx4-CreERT2 in type 2, 3, 4, and 5 bipolar cells as well as cone photoreceptor cells in the adult mouse retina. These bipolar cell subtype-specific inducible Cre mouse lines serve as efficient tools for elucidation of the mechanisms that control bipolar cell subtype development and function in the retina.",

My girlfriend wanted to upload her own pictures to that hub. Tired of having to do it for her, and with her being unwilling to learn terminal commands, I developed <strong>OrbitCopy</strong>. It uses NiceGUI because I was tired of Qt and Tkinter, and I had already used it in another project of mine, so I grew quite fond of it.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>OrbitCopy uses SSH to provide a GUI-based way of copying files and directories. It visualizes the directory structure of both systems side by side and works asynchronously to ensure there are no random freezes. It can store your credentials behind a secure PIN. The credentials are encrypted and, after three failed login attempts, are wiped entirely.</p> <p><strong>Comparison With Other Solutions</strong></p> <p>I did not really look for other solutions. This was more of a learning experience for me, and I found developing it quite relaxing.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Anyone who hates the terminal and/or just wants a visual representation of the directory structure of the target system.</p> <p>If you find bugs or want to expand the tool, feel free to open pull requests or simply fork it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Grefendor/OrbitCopy\">https://github.com/Grefendor/OrbitCopy</a></p> <p>Hope you have nice holidays</p> <p><strong>Grefendor</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Grefendor\"> /u/Grefendor </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzl05e/i_created_orbitcopy_a_gui_interface_to_use_ssh_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzl05e/i_created_orbitcopy_a_gui_interface_to_use_ssh_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
    "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

    "title": "The osm-9 mutant strain is defective in the recovery phase of long-term memory dynamics",
    "content": "Memory by definition is the storage of learned information from experiences where it can be recalled in the future. Memory is essential for organisms of any level, from single celled bacteria to complex mammals like whales in order for them to adapt and survive. The storage of long term memory is known to start in the hippocampus but long-term memory is not simply contained in this one region in the brain but across multiple regions including the cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. This diversity of locations that memory can be located in prompts the question of what molecular components within the nervous system are required to establish and maintain long term memory. To dive into this, we utilize the simple neuroanatomy of C. elegans with only 302 neurons to examine the effects of mutations of specific genes on the success of forming long term memories. Previous work established that C. elegans with defective OSM-9 proteins are unable to sustain an aversion to butanone (an odor that they are innately attracted to) after it is paired once with a negative stimulus. This helped established the importance of OSM-9 proteins for short term memory but how can the OSM-9 protein, a homolog to human TRPV5 and TRPV6 commonly associated with recognizing pain and thermoregulation rather than memory, play a part within the dynamics of space training induced long term memory? Here we show that the loss of the OSM-9 protein affects the dynamics of memory consolidation, which is the process by which short term memory is converted to long term memory. Previously, OSM-9 protein was implicated in the formation of short term memory which was termed adaptation. Here, we examine spaced training induced memory that is resistant to re-feeding and depends on sleep. This study indicates that after spaced training, the OSM-9 protein is required for the conversion of short term memory to long term memory and not acquisition. Furthermore, we confirmed that 30 minutes on food after spaced training, Wild type C. elegans seem to lose their memory but gain it back 120 minutes after, emphasizing the dynamics of memory and revealing that it is not a smoothly continuous process. Our results demonstrate that TRPV containing channels plays a role in stabilizing memory for long term use. Analyzing the specific point in which the OSM-9 protein plays a part in reactivating memory may help pave the way to a more detailed understanding of memory dynamics and the processes involved in recovering memory. Future work includes: identifying where the loss of memory goes, whether its masked or truly disappears can further explain what the OSM-9 protein supports when long term memory is formed; understanding if OSM-9 is directly involved with the process of reviving the memory or is it involved in the development of the C. elegans circuit which allows for this process to occur.",

    "title": "Integration of Audiovisual Danger Stimuli in the Zebrafish Tectum is Linked with Premotor and Behavioral Enhancements",
    "content": "Multisensory integration allows animals to combine cues from different sensory modalities to improve threat detection and drive evasive behaviors. While the zebrafish Tectum is classically viewed as a visual processing center, its role in integrating auditory and visual danger signals remains unclear. Using in vivo calcium imaging in larval zebrafish, we find that brief, high-amplitude auditory stimuli recruit a significant population of tectal neurons, predominantly in deep tectal layers. In addition, combined auditory and visual stimulation robustly increases both neural activity in the zebrafish Tectum and the probability of executing rapid escape maneuvers, especially for low salient stimuli. Interestingly, simultaneous auditory and visual cues engage more tectal neurons than either modality alone. Single neuron analysis reveal a population of neurons that respond to both auditory and visual cues, and importantly, shows that a proportion of those neurons only responds to multisensory stimulation. These results firmly establish the zebrafish Tectum as a multisensory processing area. Notably, the heightened tectal response during multisensory stimulation is strongly correlated with increased activity in hindbrain neurons implicated in escape-like motion events. These results link tectal multisensory integration to premotor circuits that drive behavioral output. Overall, our findings reveal the zebrafish Tectum as a hub for integration os audiovisual threat signals, and suggest a role of tectal multisensory processing in enhancing behavioral escape responses.",

    "title": "Implications of recursive Bayesian Sensory Inference",
    "content": "In this article, we examine how the balance between velocity-based and position-based proprioceptive feedback influences state estimation during motor control. We introduce a computational model of arm state inference grounded in Bayesian sensory integration and compare its behaviour to findings from three classical sensorimotor studies. The model allows us to contrast the predicted behaviour of two proprioceptive configurations: one relying primarily on position signals and another relying primarily on velocity signals, reflecting the distinct contributions of type II and type Ia muscle spindle afferents. Our simulations show that a system with strong reliance on velocity-based feedback tends to represent movement relative to previously estimated positions. In a simulated reaching task with briefly presented offset visual feedback, such an Agent produces systematic endpoint errors even after visual feedback is removed. In contrast, an Agent relying mainly on positional feedback is able to correctly update its inferred hand position after visual feedback is removed, thereby limiting this type of biased endpoint errors. When biased visual feedback remains continuously available, or when muscle vibration is simulated, the two configurations produce very similar behaviour. These results indicate that markedly different assumptions about the weighting of positional and velocity proprioceptive cues can yield similar observable behaviour in some of the often-used experimental setups designed to probe state inference processes. This underscores the importance of carefully considering the composition of proprioceptive signals when building computational models and interpreting human sensorimotor experiments. We highlight the task conditions under which our model predicts clear behavioural differences arising from the relative contribution of velocity versus positional feedback.",

    "title": "The development of an asymmetric accessory olfactory bulb in Octodon degus and the influence of social behavior in its establishment",
    "content": "The vomeronasal system (VNS) has been extensively associated with the regulation of sexual and social behaviors in mammals. This system comprises two types of vomeronasal neurons sending parallel projections from the vomeronasal organ (VNO) to the anterior and posterior portions of the accessory olfactory bulb (aAOB and pAOB, respectively). Members of caviomorph rodents develop either a larger aAOB or pAOB bias, which has been associated with ecological traits related to the pheromonal communication displayed by these species. However, it is still unknown how and when such AOB asymmetries emerge and whether experience may influence their establishment. To explore these factors, we studied the development of the VNS in Octodon degus, a caviomorph that exhibits an asymmetric AOB, in which the aAOB is larger and has more glomeruli than the pAOB. We found that both VNO and AOB are present at birth, but exhibiting substantial immature traits. Both VNS structures develop postnatally, showing mature patterns by the end of the first postnatal month. By the second postnatal week, aAOB becomes larger in size than pAOB, however, in the glomerular layer such bias appears later, by the end of the first postnatal month. The AOB asymmetry increases in extent until adulthood, as in this period the pAOB shows a minor growing rate than the aAOB. Additionally, we found that animals raised in restricted social contexts displayed a reduced AOB asymmetry in comparison to wild degus. Overall, we suggest that social experiences contribute to the development of the AOB asymmetry in degus.",

    "content": "Adaptive goal-directed actions performed under the threat of punishment introduce a demand for caution, often expressed as delayed response timing that balances urgency against error risk by allowing more time for cognitive evaluation. Although this form of temporal regulation is essential for survival, its underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that glutamatergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) regulate the timing of cued actions to avoid harm. Optogenetic activation of the STN, or its projections to the midbrain but not the globus pallidus, modulates action timing in a frequency-dependent manner, accelerating initiation to the extent that animals can no longer respond cautiously, defer actions, or stop initiated actions. These results show that the STN shapes goal-directed behavior by gating action-initiation timing, establishing its midbrain projections as a key circuit for balancing urgency and caution under threat.",

    "title": "critique on a small, boring LLM abstraction (alpha)",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I just published an alpha of a small Python library called LLMterface. This is my first attempt at releasing a public library, and I am looking for candid feedback on whether anything looks off or missing from the GitHub repo or PyPI packaging.</p> <p>What My Project Does:</p> <p>LLMterface provides a thin, provider-agnostic interface for sending prompts to large language models and receiving validated, structured responses. The core goal is to keep provider-specific logic out of application code while keeping the abstraction surface area small and explicit. It supports extension via a simple plugin model rather than baking provider details into the core library.</p> <p>Target Audience:</p> <p>This is intended for Python developers who are already integrating LLMs into real applications and want a lightweight way to swap providers or models without adopting a large framework. It is an early alpha and not positioned as production-hardened yet.</p> <p>Comparison:</p> <p>Compared to calling provider SDKs directly, this adds a small abstraction layer to centralize configuration and response validation. Compared to frameworks like LangChain, it deliberately avoids agents, chains, workflows, and prompt tooling, aiming to stay minimal and boring.</p> <p>Feedback Request and links:</p> <p>I would really appreciate feedback on whether this abstraction feels justified, whether the API is understandable after a quick read of the README, and whether there are any obvious red flags in the project structure, documentation, or packaging. GitHub issues are open if that is easier.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/3Ring/LLMterface\">https://github.com/3Ring/LLMterface</a> PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/llmterface/\">https://pypi.org/project/llmterface/</a></p> <p>If this feels unnecessary or misguided, that feedback is just as valuable. I am trying to decide whether this is worth continuing to invest in.</p> <p>Thanks for taking a look.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Punk-in-Pie\"> /u/Punk-in-Pie </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzpxux/critique_on_a_small_boring_llm_abstraction_alpha/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzpxux/critique_on_a_small_boring_llm_abstraction_alpha/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Effect of Biceps Brachii Muscle Stimulation on Respiration before and after Cervical Spinal Cord Injury.",
    "content": "Cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI) often lead to respiratory impairments, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. Limb muscle/afferent stimulation has been suggested as a potential approach to enhance breathing when supraspinal control over spinal respiratory circuits is compromised due to cervical SCI. Using a combination of intact, C2 Hemisected (C2Hx), and complete C1 Transected (C1Tx) rat models, we systematically evaluated the influence of forelimb muscle afferent input on phrenic motor output and respiratory patterns. Computational modeling was employed to replicate our experimental data and generate predictions. The developed computational model incorporates bilaterally located spinal and supraspinal respiratory circuits, allowing us to simulate their specific contributions to phrenic motor output under different conditions. In this study, we hypothesize that, in addition to supraspinal control, spinal circuits integrate limb sensory input to modulate the activity of phrenic motor neurons through local excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. These intraspinal pathways, normally suppressed by inhibition, can be recruited during movement to adapt breathing to motor demands. Our experimental and computational modeling results following biceps stimulation after C2Hx and C1Tx support this hypothesis, demonstrating that activation of limb afferent pathways can enhance phrenic motor output even after partial or complete loss of supraspinal drive. In the fully transected preparation, this effect required pharmacological disinhibition, confirming the presence of latent spinal pathways. This study provides the first evidence for functionally relevant intraspinal interactions between limb muscles and respiratory circuits and identifies a potential spinal mechanism that could be leveraged to promote breathing recovery after cervical SCI.",

    "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "<p>I used the time over Christmas and in between the years to redesign my website.<p>This time I decided to make it in the theme of an evil Sith Lord that commands the Galactic Cookie Empire, because I found my previous cookie consent game a bit boring after a while.<p>Here's the website's welcome page and the cookie consent game: <a href=\"https://cookie.engineer/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cookie.engineer/index.html</a><p>(the cookie consent game isn't started on any other page of my website, only on the welcome page)<p>I also made a \"making of\" weblog article series, in case you're interested in the development process and how I implemented it and what kind of troubles I went through already:<p>- Making of the Game: <a href=\"https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website-part-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website...</a><p>- Making of the Avatar: <a href=\"https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website-part-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website...</a><p>- Debuggers to toy around with: <a href=\"https://cookie.engineer/design/consent/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cookie.engineer/design/consent/index.html</a><p>It \"should\" work on modern browsers. I tested it on Firefox on Linuxes, Chrome/Chromium on Linuxes, and Safari on Macbook. Don't have an iPhone so I can't test that, but my two old Android phones were also working fine with the meta viewport hack (I can't believe this is still the \"modern\" way to do things after 15 years. Wtf).<p>Best experience is of course with a bigger display. On smaller screen sizes, the game will use a camera to zoom around the game world and follow the player's spaceship. Minimum window width is 1280 pixels for no camera, and I think 800 pixels to be playable (otherwise the avatar gets in the way too much in the boss fights).<p>Oh, there's also a secret boss fight that you can unlock when you toy around with the Dev Tools :)<p>What's left to do on the avatar animation side:<p>- I have to backport CMUdict to JavaScript / ECMAScript. That's what I'm working on right now, as I'm not yet satisfied with the timings of the phonemes. Existing tools and pipelines that do this in python aren't realtime, which leads to my next point.<p>- I want to switch to using the \"waveform energy detection\" and a zero cross rate detector to time phonemes more correctly. I believe that changes in waveforms and their structures can detect differences in phonemes, but it's a gut feeling and not a scientific fact. Existing phoneme animation papers were kind of shit and broken (see my making of article 2). The phoneme boundary detector is highly experimental though and is gonna need a couple weeks more time until it's finished.<p>That's it for now, hope you gonna enjoy your stay on my website and I hope you gonna have fun playing the Cookie Consent Game :)<p>Oh, also, because it might not be obvious: No LLMs were used in the making of this website. Pretty much everything is hand-coded, and unbundled and unminified on purpose so visitors can learn from the code if they want to.<p>~Cookie</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46436128\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46436128</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN \u2014<p>Tidy Baby is a new game made by me and Wyna Liu (of NYT Connections!) that is inspired by the legendary card-based game SET that we assume many of you love (we too love SET).<p>In SET, you\u2019ve got four dimensions: shape, number, color, and shading, each with three variants.<p>In Tidy Baby you only have to deal with three dimensions:<p>- word length (3, 4, or 5 letters)\n- part of speech (noun, verb, or adjective)\n- style (bold, underline, or italic)<p>Like in SET, you are trying to form sets of three cards where, along each dimension, the set is either all the same or all different. If you\u2019ve never played SET there are more details/examples at \u201chow to play\u201d in the game.<p>The mechanics of Tidy Baby are sort of inspired by a solitaire/practice version of SET I sometimes play where you draw two random cards and have to name the third card that would make a valid set.<p>In Tidy Baby you are presented with two \u201cgame cards\u201d and a grid of up to nine candidates to complete a valid set \u2013 your job is to pick the right one before the clock runs out.<p>Unlike in SET, you get points for \u201cpartial\u201d sets where your set is valid on one or two dimensions (but not all three). It\u2019s actually a pretty fun challenge to try to get only sets that are invalid along all three dimensions.<p>In building the game, we were sort of surprised that the biggest challenge was ensuring that all words were unambiguously one part of speech. You\u2019d be surprised how hard it is to find three-letter adjectives that are not also common verbs or nouns. We did our best!<p>We\u2019ve got three \u201cpaces\u201d in the game: Steady, Strenuous, and Grueling (s/o MECC!)<p>Let us know what you think!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46434580\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46434580</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "title": "Ensemble Coding of Hidden Objects in Visual Cortex",
    "content": "Many species exhibit the understanding that visual objects that become hidden by others nonetheless still exist, a property known as object permanence. Previous studies in human and nonhuman primates have provided evidence that neurons within visual cortex encode objects that are remembered but not seen. However, past neurophysiological studies have generally failed to find evidence of visual cortical representations of hidden objects. We measured the activity of large populations of neurons within dorsal extrastriate cortex of macaques trained to monitor the identity of visual objects that moved behind an irrelevant occluder. We found that although the firing rates of neuronal populations signaled the trajectory of hidden objects throughout the occlusion period, coding of object identity in the same activity decayed to chance before the behavioral trial ended. Nevertheless, information about the hidden object was present in the coordinated activity of neuronal populations. Specifically, the strength and presence of pairwise cross-correlations reliably depended on the identity of the hidden object. These results demonstrate that ensembles of visual cortical neurons preserve information about hidden objects independent of single neuron firing rates.",

This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals.

    "title": "From movement to cognitive maps: recurrent neural networks reveal how locomotor development shapes hippocampal spatial coding",
    "content": "The hippocampus contains neurons whose firing correlates with an animal's location and orientation in space. Collectively, these neurons are held to support a cognitive map of the environment, enabling the recall of and navigation to specific locations. Although recent studies have characterised the timelines of spatial neuron development, no unifying mechanistic model has yet been proposed. Moreover, the processes driving the emergence of spatial representations in the hippocampus remain unclear (Tan et al., 2017). Here, we combine computational analysis of postnatal locomotor development with a recurrent neural network (RNN) model of hippocampal function to demonstrate how changes in movement statistics -- and the resulting sensory experiences -- shape the formation of spatial tuning. First, we identify distinct developmental stages in rat locomotion during open-field exploration using published experimental data. Then, we train shallow RNNs to predict upcoming visual stimuli from concurrent visual and vestibular inputs, exposing them to trajectories that reflect progressively maturing locomotor patterns. Our findings reveal that these changing movement statistics drive the sequential emergence of spatially tuned units, mirroring the developmental timeline observed in rats. The models generate testable predictions about how spatial tuning properties mature -- predictions we confirm through analysis of hippocampal recordings. Critically, we demonstrate that replicating the specific statistics of developmental locomotion -- rather than merely accelerating sensory change -- is essential for the emergence of an allocentric spatial representation. These results establish a mechanistic link between embodied sensorimotor experience and the ontogeny of hippocampal spatial neurons, with significant implications for neurodevelopmental research and predictive models of navigational brain circuits.",

    "content": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worsens stroke outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms linking T2DM to systemic immune dysfunction remain unclear. We investigated whether T2DM alters bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis and dysregulate immune signaling following ischemic stroke in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing, GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP), nCounter, and flow cytometry were used to analyze BM cells from control (db/+, Ctrl) and diabetic (db/db, T2DM) mice underwent experimental stroke or sham surgery. Diabetes caused marked structural remodeling of BM, with reduced cellularity and imbalance of hematopoietic lineages. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed impaired differentiation and maturation signatures of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and granulocytes, and overactivation toward monocytes in diabetes after stroke. CellChat analysis demonstrated reorganization of intercellular communication, with hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and monocytes emerging as dominant signaling hubs through upregulated MIF, SIRP, and THBS pathways. AUCell enrichment indicated increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation but reduced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, reflecting metabolic activation coupled with immune dysregulation. DSP and nCounter further confirmed upregulation of genes in the MIF, SIRP and THBS pathways in CD115 monocytes and Ly6G neutrophils, indicating proinflammatory and migratory activation in diabetic bone marrow. Our data suggest that T2DM reprograms hematopoiesis and signaling networks, leading to maladaptive myeloid responses and impaired immune regulation after stroke. This maladaptive BM environment amplifies inflammation and limits repair, linking diabetic metabolic stress to worsened ischemic outcomes. Targeting bone marrow immune dysfunction may offer a therapeutic strategy to improve stroke recovery in diabetic patients.",

    "content": "Understanding how neural circuits compute requires capturing voltage dynamics across large neuronal populations with millisecond resolution in vivo. However, two-photon voltage imaging remains fundamentally limited by a trade-off among imaging speed, field of view, and excitation efficiency. We introduce HS2PM, a hybrid scanning two-photon microscope that overcomes this bottleneck, enabling kilohertz-rate imaging over a 650x524 m2 field of view at single-cell resolution while preserving the photon efficiency of single-point excitation. HS2PM stably records deep-layer membrane potentials from over 160 neurons simultaneously, with minimal photobleaching and phototoxicity. It resolves both spikes and subthreshold voltage dynamics in vivo, revealing how these jointly shape sensory adaptation and population coding. Beyond voltage imaging, HS2PM supports high-speed fluorescence lifetime and vascular flow imaging, establishing a multimodal platform for dissecting fast circuit dynamics with precision previously inaccessible to optical methods.",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

    "title": "Decoding medial entorhinal cortical dynamics produces planning-like alternations in hippocampal theta sequences",
    "content": "The hippocampus plays a central role in memory and spatial planning. In rodents, theta oscillations (7-12Hz) are associated with active navigation and appear necessary for planning and spatial memory. A key neural mechanism held to support navigational decision making are theta sequences - brief (~120ms) sequential activations of hippocampal place cells representing trajectories ahead of the animal. Evidence for their role in planning includes their tendency to sample potential future paths at decision points, particularly the left-right sequences observed along the T-maze arms during alternation tasks. However, a recent study challenges this interpretation, proposing that the natural tendency of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) theta sequences to alternate between leftward and rightward directions might account for the apparent sampling of arms on the T-maze. Given that MEC inputs drive hippocampal activity, this raises the possibility that hippocampal alternations in T-mazes simply reflect intrinsic MEC dynamics rather than active planning. Here, we test this hypothesis by modelling MEC theta sequences in a T-shaped maze and demonstrate that standard Bayesian decoding produces hippocampal theta sequences alternating between maze arms, consistent with experimental observations. Analysis of simultaneous MEC-hippocampal recordings reveals that MEC alternation consistently precedes hippocampus by ~50ms, suggesting a feedforward, state-independent mechanism. This coordinated MEC-hippocampal left-right alternation occurs not only at choice points but also during inbound trials (where no deliberate choice is required) and at forced-turn corners (where only one path exists). These findings suggest that left-right alternation in hippocampal theta sequences is a ubiquitous phenomenon driven by MEC dynamics, challenging the interpretation that these specifically reflect intentional decision-making or planning processes.",

    "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
    "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

    "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
    "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "title": "Low perioperative hemoglobin as an independent detrimental predictor of functional outcome after basal ganglia hemorrhage: development and validation of a composite prognostic model",
    "content": "BackgroundBasal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) is a life-threatening neurosurgical emergency associated with substantial mortality and disability. Accurate postoperative prognosis assessment remains challenging due to multifactorial influences. Hemoglobin (HB), as the key determinant of oxygen delivery, may play a critical role in neurological recovery, yet the prognostic significance of perioperative HB fluctuations in BGH has not been fully elucidated.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 213 surgically treated BGH patients from 2020 to 2023 was analyzed. Perioperative HB indices, including preoperative (Pre-HB), postoperative (Post-HB), and mean HB (Mean-HB) levels, were evaluated alongside clinical data. Functional outcome at 6 months was determined based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression together with multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to screen for independent risk variables, followed by construction of a composite predictive model. Model discrimination, calibration, and evaluation of the model\u2019s clinical applicability were conducted using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsPatients with poor prognosis exhibited significantly lower Pre-HB, Post-HB, and Mean-HB levels (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed these variables as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The proposed model provides a practical and data-driven tool that demonstrated good predictive performance (AUC = 0.84) in a single-center retrospective cohort. Calibration and DCA demonstrated good consistency and potential clinical applicability.ConclusionPerioperative declines in HB are independently associated with poor postoperative outcomes in BGH. The proposed HB-integrated model provides a reliable, dynamic tool for individualized risk prediction, facilitating precision perioperative management and optimized recovery strategies.",

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "An algorithmic procedure for measuring deep brain stimulation-induced capsular activation using motor evoked potentials",
    "content": "Objective. Effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease requires careful surgical targeting and adjustment of stimulation parameters to avoid motor side effects caused by activation of the internal capsule. Currently, patients must self-report side effects during implantation surgery and device programming\u2014a subjective and inconsistent process that may delay optimized treatment or result in suboptimal therapy. Motor evoked potentials (mEP), the use of electromyography to record DBS-induced muscle activation, offer a promising biomarker for objective motor side effect detection. Approach. We present an automated algorithmic procedure for mEP detection and quantification. Main results. First, we design and evaluate a series of signal processing techniques to accurately detect mEP while mitigating the influence of stimulation artifacts and noise, then demonstrate a strategy for integrating multi-channel EMG responses into a single side effect biomarker (the mEP score). Next, we use data from a large patient cohort of intraoperative recordings (N = 54 subthalamic nucleus (STN) leads) to quantify several physiological features of mEP, including their response frequency, latency, amplitude, and waveform similarity properties. Last, we show that the mEP score responds to DBS amplitude and contact configuration parameters in a manner that is consistent with expected STN-capsular anatomy. Significance. The results of this study inform an end-to-end approach for side effect biomarker measurement that could aid the precision and efficiency of surgical targeting and DBS programming.",

    "title": "An out-of-the-lab evaluation of dry EEG technology on a large-scale motor imagery brain-computer interface dataset",
    "content": "Objective. This study assesses the signal quality of state-of-the-art dry electroencephalography (EEG) under highly challenging, uncontrolled, real-world conditions and compares it to conventional wet EEG. Approach. EEG data from 530 participants recorded during a public exhibition were benchmarked against several established signal quality metrics, including spiking activity, kurtosis, auto-mutual information, spectral entropy, gamma-band power, and parameters extracted using the fitting oscillations and one-over F model. Additionally, ICLabel decomposition was applied to quantify artifact influences across EEG channels. Dry electrode results were compared with their equivalents extracted on two control datasets comprising 71 and 80 participants, respectively, recorded with wet EEG systems in laboratory, home, or clinical surroundings. Main results. The analysis revealed condition-specific susceptibility to artifacts for both EEG modalities. The dry EEG system exhibited substantial robustness in moderate-noise scenarios, with artifact profiles comparable to controlled wet EEG recordings. However, recordings obtained in highly dynamic conditions showed increased muscle artifacts and broadband activity, notably in frontal and temporal regions. Wet EEG systems, under controlled conditions, were overall less inflicted by artifacts, yet, fronto-central ocular and muscular artifacts were consistently present. ICLabel analysis further confirmed these findings, indicating similar proportions of brain-related activity across systems (approximately 31%\u201349.5%), but highlighted increased vulnerability to movement and environmental artifacts in dry EEG during dynamic tasks. Significance. In agreement with recent similar investigations, our findings demonstrate that dry EEG caps have significantly matured, achieving signal quality comparable to wet EEG systems even in challenging real-world conditions, provided appropriate artifact mitigation strategies are employed. These results affirm the practical readiness and broad feasibility of dry EEG technologies for diverse Brain\u2013computer interface applications in naturalistic environments.",

    "title": "Temporal properties of direct current sensory block of the rat sciatic nerve using the C-fiber reflex",
    "content": "Objective. Direct current (DC) electrical block of peripheral sensory axons has potential for clinical applications in pain management. The C-fiber reflex (CFR), elicited via noxious stimulation of the foot, is suitable for investigating the activation of unmyelinated C-fiber nerves, the fiber class that is responsible for lingering pain sensations. Approach. In anesthetized rats, the CFR was elicited via electrical stimulation to the plantar surface of the hindpaw, and the resulting C-fiber-evoked electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded from the ipsilateral biceps femoris muscle. A carbon separated interface nerve electrode was used to deliver DC block to arrest action potentials in the sciatic nerve. The efficacy of the block was observed as a reduction/abolition of the magnitude of the EMG in a time window corresponding to the latency of C-fibers activity. Main results. Complete cessation of nerve activity could be achieved instantaneously by applying DC at the \u2018block threshold (BT)\u2019. At amplitudes below the BT, complete block could be induced over a period of seconds to minutes, with lower currents being correlated with longer induction times. When block was applied for prolonged periods of time, block was sustained following the cessation of DC delivery. This \u2018recovery period\u2019 was longer for longer durations of block application. Significance. The CFR is an established method to investigate pharmaceutical pain therapies, yet to date, has not been used to assess electrical block of sensory axons. Therefore, anatomical and electrophysiological methods were used to validate this method. DC nerve block shows promise for clinical pain management applications. Furthermore, the temporal properties described here could be used to reduce overall electrical current delivery and improve safety.",

    "title": "Dynamic graph representation of EEG signals for speech imagery recognition",
    "content": "Objective. Speech imagery recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an emerging challenge in brain-computer interfaces, and has important applications, such as in the interaction with locked-in patients. In this work, we use graph signal processing for developing a more effective representation of EEG signals in speech imagery recognition. Approach. We propose a dynamic graph representation that uses multiple graphs constructed based on the time-varying correlations between EEG channels. Our methodology is particularly suitable for signals that exhibit fluctuating correlations, which cannot be adequately modeled through a static (single graph) model. The resultant representation provides graph frequency features that compactly capture the spatial patterns of the underlying multidimensional EEG signal as well as the evolution of spatial relationships over time. These dynamic graph features are fed into an attention-based long short-term memory network for speech imagery recognition. A novel EEG data augmentation method is also proposed for improving training robustness. Main results. Experimental evaluation using a range of experiments shows that the proposed dynamic graph features are more effective than conventional time-frequency features for speech imagery recognition. The overall system outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, yielding accuracy gains of up to 10%. Significance. The dynamic graph representation captures time-varying spatial relationships in EEG signals, overcoming limitations of static graph models and conventional feature extraction. Combined with data augmentation and attention-based classification, it demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in speech imagery recognition.",

    "content": "Objective. Advances in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) have rapidly accelerated in the last decade that promises to improve the quality of life of patients with communications, sensory, and motor control disabilities. Approach. In this Perspective, we quantify the extent and nature of scientific convergence across 21 research groups conducting iBCI clinical trials worldwide. Using medical subject headers and Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomies, we analyze topical and disciplinary integration within 161 publications from 1998\u20132023 to assess how deeply team composition aligns with research themes and translational impact. Main Results. Our findings indicate uneven patterns of convergence, with many teams combining engineering and clinical expertise yet omitting ethical, legal, and social dimensions. This represents what we term short-cut convergence. Significance. We propose an operational definition of this phenomenon and identify practical steps for researchers and funders to strengthen full convergence to accelerate iBCI translation and implementation.",

    "title": "Electrical characterization and accelerated aging of amorphous silicon carbide implantable encapsulation",
    "content": "Objective. Chronically implanted microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are used for stimulating and recording neural activity in research and clinical settings. However, their reliability can be compromised by insufficient encapsulation stability. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), a chemically stable and biocompatible material, has emerged as a potential thin-film encapsulation for MEAs. We aimed to evaluate thin-film a-SiC encapsulation using electrical-accelerated aging (EAA) and to demonstrate a methodology for obtaining acceleration factors for EAA by Weibull analysis. Approach. Interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) encapsulated with a-SiC were subjected to voltage cycling and stepped-voltage protocols to measure leakage currents in buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C. EAA employed incrementally increasing voltage biases over time to induce degradation and reveal failure mechanisms. Main results. IDEs exhibited a significant change in electrical behavior on exposure to saline, with failure initiating at specific voltages and accompanied by gas evolution at defect sites. Incremental voltage biasing revealed a capacitive-to-faradaic transition in leakage current response that was used as a failure criterion. Significance. Acceleration factors for voltage-driven accelerated aging of a-SiC thin-film encapsulation can be obtained by Weibull analysis using a mechanistic failure criterion. Breakdown occurs at processing-related defects in the a-SiC. This study demonstrates the use of EAA for evaluating failure in a-SiC thin-film encapsulation used in implantable MEAs. EAA is broadly applicable to thin-film MEAs and provides a highly relevant method of predicting implanted lifetimes of bioelectronics.",

    "title": "sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing in a large adult and pediatric cohort",
    "content": "Objective. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort. Approach. Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery. Main results. 26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone. Significance. Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.",

    "title": "Chemogenetic activation of hippocampal area CA2 promotes acute and chronic seizures in a mouse model of epilepsy",
    "content": "Pyramidal cells (PCs) of hippocampal area CA2 exhibit increased excitability in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in mouse models of TLE. In epileptic mice, selective inhibition of CA2 PCs reduces chronic seizures. Here we asked if activating CA2 PCs increases seizures. Mice expressing Cre recombinase in CA2 PCs (Amigo2-Cre mice) were injected with the convulsant pilocarpine to induce a period of severe seizures (status epilepticus, SE), which leads to chronic seizures after 3-4 weeks (epilepsy). Epileptic mice were injected with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) to express an excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (eDREADD; hM3Dq) in dorsal CA2 bilaterally and implanted with subdural EEG electrodes. After recovery, mice were recorded continuously using video and EEG for 6 weeks, 3 weeks with drinking water containing the eDREADD activator clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and 3 weeks without CNO. CA2 activation with CNO caused a significant increase in seizure frequency and duration. Seizures occurred in clusters (many seizures per day over several consecutive days) and mice given water with CNO had a greater maximum number of seizures per day during a cluster compared to water without CNO. CNO had no significant effect in control mice. In naive Amigo2-Cre mice expressing hM3Dq, pre-treatment with CNO before pilocarpine administration shortened the latency to SE and increased EEG power at the start of SE. Taken together with prior findings, the results suggest that CA2 is a control point for regulating seizures in the pilocarpine mouse model of TLE.",

    "title": "Prefrontal 5-HT2A receptors directly contribute to tic ontogeny: translational evidence",
    "content": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics and frequently accompanied by comorbidities such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and pathological aggression. Although approved pharmacotherapies often reduce tic severity, they frequently cause adverse effects and are insufficient for managing comorbid symptoms, underscoring the need for improved treatments. Recent evidence indicates that the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) antagonist pimavanserin reduces tic severity and improves quality of life, yet its mechanism of action in TS remains unclear. Here, we combine postmortem human and preclinical approaches to gain insight into the role of 5-HT2ARs in TS. Western-blot analyses of postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples obtained from individuals with TS revealed a pronounced, male-specific elevation of 5-HT2AR protein levels in Brodmann Area (BA) 10. We then tested pimavanserin and the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist volinanserin in two mouse models of TS: D1CT-7 transgenic mice and mice with early-life depletion of striatal cholinergic interneurons. Systemic administration of pimavanserin (1-2 mg/kg, IP) or volinanserin (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, IP) robustly reduced tic-like movements and stereotypies in both models. Local infusion of pimavanserin into the medial PFC, but not the dorsal striatum, recapitulated these effects, indicating a cortical locus of action. Pimavanserin also reduced resident-intruder aggression, but not locomotion or anxiety-like behavior. Together, these findings identify elevated prefrontal 5-HT2ARs as a key mechanistic contributor to TS and a promising therapeutic target for individuals with TS and pathological aggression.",

    "content": "Loss-of-function mutations in Progranulin (GRN) cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) and hereditary frontotemporal dementia, presumably through lysosomal dysfunction. The effect of progranulin deficiency on cell type-specific lysosomal composition in the mammalian brain has not been examined. We used cell type-specific LysoIP to perform tandem-mass-tag mass-spectrometry and detected distinct aberrant proteomic signatures in progranulin-deficient astrocytes, neurons, and microglia, indicating cell type-specific dysregulation of key lysosomal proteins with crucial functions in sphingolipid metabolism and lysosome organization. These proteins markedly differed from progranulin-deficient RNAseq data sets, suggesting progranulin regulates lysosomal composition through post-translational mechanisms including the sorting of nascent proteins to the lysosome. Validation experiments confirmed that Mfsd8 and Ppt1, proteins whose mutation on their own cause NCL, were essentially absent from progranulin-deficient neuronal and microglial lysosomes, respectively. Our findings suggest that progranulin may function as an essential hub protein during endolysosomal sorting and highlight the necessity of restoring stoichiometric levels of progranulin expression in the secretory pathway for the development of effective therapeutic strategies.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
    "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.23055v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Traditional flight computers -- including mechanical \"whiz-wheels\" (e.g. E6B, CRP series) and electronic flight calculators (e.g. ASA CX-3, Sportys E6-B) -- have long played a central role in flight planning and training within general aviation (GA). While these tools remain pedagogically valuable, their fixed form factors, constrained interaction models, and limited extensibility are increasingly misaligned with the expectations and workflows of pilots operating in modern digital environments.\n  This paper presents E6BJA (Jamies Flight Computer), a fully featured, multi-platform, software-based flight computer designed natively for Apple iOS, Android, and Microsoft Windows devices, with a complementary web-based implementation. E6BJA reproduces the core calculations of traditional flight computers while extending them through enhanced modelling capabilities such as the 1976 International Standard Atmosphere, carburettor icing risk estimation, and aircraft-specific weight and balance calculators. Each calculator is accompanied by embedded educational monographs that explain underlying assumptions, variables, and equations.\n  We compare E6BJA with mechanical and electronic flight computers across functional, cognitive, and technical dimensions, demonstrating improvements in accuracy, error reduction, discoverability, and educational value. We also discuss design trade-offs associated with native multi-platform development and examine how contemporary mobile computing environments can support safer and more intuitive pre-flight planning for pilots, trainees, instructors, and flight planning personnel. By combining the conceptual rigour of traditional flight planning methods with modern human-computer interaction design, E6BJA represents a meaningful evolution in pilot-facing flight tools, supporting both computation and instruction in aviation training contexts.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.23054v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While millimeter-wave (mmWave) presents advantages for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) through its non-intrusive sensing capabilities, current mmWave-based HPE methods face limitations in two predominant input paradigms: Heatmap and Point Cloud (PC). Heatmap represents dense multi-dimensional features derived from mmWave, but is significantly affected by multipath propagation and hardware modulation noise. PC, a set of 3D points, is obtained by applying the Constant False Alarm Rate algorithm to the Heatmap, which suppresses noise but results in sparse human-related features. To address these limitations, we study the feasibility of providing an alternative input paradigm: Differentiable Physics-driven Human Representation (DIPR), which represents humans as an ensemble of Gaussian distributions with kinematic and electromagnetic parameters. Inspired by Gaussian Splatting, DIPR leverages human kinematic priors and mmWave propagation physics to enhance human features while mitigating non-human noise through two strategies: 1) We incorporate prior kinematic knowledge to initialize DIPR based on the Heatmap and establish multi-faceted optimization objectives, ensuring biomechanical validity and enhancing motion features. 2) We simulate complete mmWave processing pipelines, re-render a new Heatmap from DIPR, and compare it with the original Heatmap, avoiding spurious noise generation due to kinematic constraints overfitting. Experimental results on three datasets with four methods demonstrate that existing mmWave-based HPE methods can easily integrate DIPR and achieve superior performance.",

ChatGraPhT is an interactive tool that shows dialogue as a visual map, allowing users to branch and merge ideas, edit past messages, and receive guidance that prompts deeper reflection. It supports non-linear, multi-path dialogue, while two agentic LLM assistants provide moment-to-moment and higher-level guidance. Our inquiry suggests that keeping the conversation structure visible, allowing branching and merging, and suggesting patterns or ways to combine ideas deepened user reflective engagement.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22747v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Data that contextualizes student interactions with online learning systems can be challenging to obtain. This study looks at the rhetorical strategies of a novel method for conducting in-the-moment Data-Driven Classroom Interviews (DDCIs). By using Ordered Network Analysis (ONA) to reanalyze data from Wei et al.'s (2025) Epistemic Network Analysis, we better account for the sequences in which these rhetorical strategies emerge during the interview process. Specifically, we examine how five rhetorical strategies by interviewers relate to five possible rhetorical strategies used in student responses. As with the previous study, results demonstrate minor differences in how students with high and low situational interest respond. Namely, whereas students with high situational interest show moderately higher levels of enthusiasm, students with low situational interest are more likely to respond to interviewers with an explanation. However, overall this study confirms that there are few interviewer-driven differences in these interviews, and it documents that interviewers are following guidelines to rely upon open-ended questions",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22656v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Clinical electroencephalography is routinely used to evaluate patients with diverse and often overlapping neurological conditions, yet interpretation remains manual, time-intensive, and variable across experts. While automated EEG analysis has been widely studied, most existing methods target isolated diagnostic problems, particularly seizure detection, and provide limited support for multi-disorder clinical screening.\n  This study examines automated EEG-based classification across eleven clinically relevant neurological disorder categories, encompassing acute time-critical conditions, chronic neurocognitive and developmental disorders, and disorders with indirect or weak electrophysiological signatures. EEG recordings are processed using a standard longitudinal bipolar montage and represented through a multi-domain feature set capturing temporal statistics, spectral structure, signal complexity, and inter-channel relationships. Disorder-aware machine learning models are trained under severe class imbalance, with decision thresholds explicitly calibrated to prioritize diagnostic sensitivity.\n  Evaluation on a large, heterogeneous clinical EEG dataset demonstrates that sensitivity-oriented modeling achieves recall exceeding 80% for the majority of disorder categories, with several low-prevalence conditions showing absolute recall gains of 15-30% after threshold calibration compared to default operating points. Feature importance analysis reveals physiologically plausible patterns consistent with established clinical EEG markers.\n  These results establish realistic performance baselines for multi-disorder EEG classification and provide quantitative evidence that sensitivity-prioritized automated analysis can support scalable EEG screening and triage in real-world clinical settings.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22481v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Decoding fine-grained movement from non-invasive surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a challenge for prosthetic control due to signal non-stationarity and low signal-to-noise ratios. Generic self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks often yield suboptimal results on sEMG as they attempt to reconstruct noisy raw signals and lack the inductive bias to model the cylindrical topology of electrode arrays. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a domain-specific SSL framework. SPECTRE features two primary contributions: a physiologically-grounded pre-training task and a novel positional encoding. The pre-training involves masked prediction of discrete pseudo-labels from clustered Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representations, compelling the model to learn robust, physiologically relevant frequency patterns. Additionally, our Cylindrical Rotary Position Embedding (CyRoPE) factorizes embeddings along linear temporal and annular spatial dimensions, explicitly modeling the forearm sensor topology to capture muscle synergies. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including challenging data from individuals with amputation, demonstrate that SPECTRE establishes a new state-of-the-art for movement decoding, significantly outperforming both supervised baselines and generic SSL approaches. Ablation studies validate the critical roles of both spectral pre-training and CyRoPE. SPECTRE provides a robust foundation for practical myoelectric interfaces capable of handling real-world sEMG complexities.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22462v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As large language models (LLMs) are embedded into mental health technologies, they are often framed either as tools assisting therapists or autonomous therapeutic systems. Such perspectives overlook their potential to mediate relational complexities in therapy, particularly for systemically marginalized clients. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 12 therapists and 12 marginalized clients in China, including LGBTQ+ individuals or those from other marginalized backgrounds, we identify enduring relational challenges: difficulties building trust amid institutional barriers, the burden clients carry in educating therapists about marginalized identities, and challenges sustaining authentic self-disclosure across therapy and daily life. We argue that addressing these challenges requires AI systems capable of actively mediating underlying knowledge gaps, power asymmetries, and contextual disconnects. To this end, we propose the Dynamic Boundary Mediation Framework, which reconceptualizes LLM-enhanced systems as adaptive boundary objects that shift mediating roles across therapeutic stages. The framework delineates three forms of mediation: Epistemic (reducing knowledge asymmetries), Relational (rebalancing power dynamics), and Contextual (bridging therapy-life discontinuities). This framework offers a pathway toward designing relationally accountable AI systems that center the lived realities of marginalized users and more effectively support therapeutic relationships.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22407v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Lowering the barriers to computer programming requires understanding how to scaffold learning. Parsons problems, which require learners to drag-and-drop blocks of code into the correct order and indentation, are proving to be beneficial for scaffolding learning how to write code from scratch. But little is known about the ability of other problem types to do so. This study explores learners' perceptions of a new programming environment called Codespec, which was developed to make computer programming more accessible and equitable by offering multiple means of engagement. Retrospective think-aloud interviews were conducted with nine programmers who were given the choice between Faded Parsons and Pseudocode Parsons problems as optional scaffolding toward solving write-code problems. The results showed that offering Faded and Pseudocode Parsons problems as optional scaffolds supported comprehension monitoring, strategy formation, and refinement of prior knowledge. Learners selectively used Faded Parsons problems for syntax/structure and Pseudocode Parsons problems for high-level reasoning. The costs noted included the time it takes to drag-and-drop the blocks and the confusion experienced when a solution diverges from a learners' mental model. Faded Parsons problems were also perceived as a desirable challenge. This study contributes to the field of computing education and human-computer interaction by extending the functionality of problem spaces that support Parsons problems and by providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of using other problem types as scaffolding techniques.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22404v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With the significant increase in enrollment in computing-related programs over the past 20 years, lecture sizes have grown correspondingly. In large lectures, instructors face challenges on identifying students' knowledge gaps timely, which is critical for effective teaching. Existing classroom response systems rely on instructor-initiated interactions, which limits their ability to capture the spontaneous knowledge gaps that naturally emerge during lectures. With the widespread adoption of LLMs among students, we recognize these student-AI dialogues as a valuable, student-centered data source for identifying knowledge gaps. In this idea paper, we propose QueryQuilt, a multi-agent LLM framework that automatically detects common knowledge gaps in large-scale lectures by analyzing students' chat logs with AI assistants. QueryQuilt consists of two key components: (1) a Dialogue Agent that responds to student questions while employing probing questions to reveal underlying knowledge gaps, and (2) a Knowledge Gap Identification Agent that systematically analyzes these dialogues to identify knowledge gaps across the student population. By generating frequency distributions of identified gaps, instructors can gain comprehensive insights into class-wide understanding. Our evaluation demonstrates promising results, with QueryQuilt achieving 100% accuracy in identifying knowledge gaps among simulated students and 95% completeness when tested on real student-AI dialogue data. These initial findings indicate the system's potential for facilitate teaching in authentic learning environments. We plan to deploy QueryQuilt in actual classroom settings for comprehensive evaluation, measuring its detection accuracy and impact on instruction.",

For this reason, it is important to detect, recognize and understand emotions using computational systems to improve communication between people and machines, which would facilitate the ability of computers to understand the communication between humans. This study proposes the creation of a model that allows the classification of people's emotions based on their EEG signals, for which the brain-computer interface EMOTIV EPOC was used. This allowed the collection of electroencephalographic information from 50 people, all of whom were shown audiovisual resources that helped to provoke the desired mood. The information obtained was stored in a database for the generation of the model and the corresponding classification analysis. Random Forest model was created for emotion prediction (happiness, sadness and relaxation), based on the signals of any person. The results obtained were 97.21% accurate for happiness, 76% for relaxation and 76% for sadness. Finally, the model was used to generate a real-time emotion prediction algorithm; it captures the person's EEG signals, executes the generated algorithm and displays the result on the screen with the help of images representative of each emotion.",

    "content": "arXiv:2212.04195v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recent advances and reflections on reproducible human neuroscience, especially brain-wide association studies (BWAS) leveraging large datasets, have led to divergent and sometimes opposing views on research practices and priorities. The debates span multiple dimensions. Shifts along these axes have fractured consensus and further fragmented an already heterogeneous field of cognitive neuroscience. Here, we sketch a holistic and integrative response grounded in population neuroscience, organized around a closed-loop \"design-analysis-interpretation\" research cycle that aims to build consensus while bridging these divides. Our central claim is that population neuroscience offers a unique population-level vantage point for identifying general principles, characterizing inter-individual variabilities, and benchmarking intra-individual changes, thereby providing a supportive framework for small-scale, mechanism-focused studies at the individual level and allowing them to co-evolve with population-level studies. Population neuroscience is not simply about providing larger N for BWAS; its deeper goal is to accumulate a family of cross-scale priors and shared infrastructures that can support design, analysis, and interpretation of human neuroscience for decades to come. In this sense, we outline a \"third-generation\" view of population neuroscience that reorients the field from amassing isolated associations toward building integrative reference frameworks for future mechanistic and translational work.",

While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22568v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.23661v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The behavioral description of the sensorimotor synchronization phenomenon in humans is exhaustive, mostly by using variations of the traditional paced finger-tapping task. This task helps unveil the inner workings of the error-correction mechanism responsible for the resynchronization after a perturbation to the period of the stimuli sequence. Yet, fundamental contradictions still exist among different works in the literature. One of such contradictions only emerges after comparing the two most-common period perturbation types: step changes and phase shifts. The stimulus sequence is exactly the same in both perturbation types up to and including the (unexpected) perturbed stimulus. Why then would the timing of the next response be different between perturbation types, as observed? The explanation lies in the buildup of different temporal contexts during the experiments that recalibrate the error-correction mechanism. Here we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that responses to different perturbation types are dynamically incompatible when they occur in separate experiments. That is, they can't be represented by the same underlying dynamical system, thus explaining many contradictory results and the difficulty in reproducing both types of perturbations with a single mathematical model. On the other hand, if both perturbation types are presented at random during the same experiment then the responses are compatible with each other and can be construed as produced by a unique underlying mechanism. We conclude that a single underlying dynamical system can represent the response to all perturbation types, signs, and sizes, which is nevertheless recalibrated by temporal context. Our results offer a ground for performing better comparisons in paced finger tapping and extend the usable range of data beyond the perturbed stimulus and into the information-rich resynchronization phase.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.23301v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Sensory prediction (SP) is a fundamental mechanism of perception that supports cognitive development. Atypical SP has been reported across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (ND), suggesting it may constitute an early cross-syndromic marker. Premature birth is a major risk factor for ND, with risk increasing as gestational age (GA) at birth decreases. However, how perinatal risk factors shape the development of SP remains poorly understood. We do not know if untimely birth itself, or exposure to iatrogenic pain during neonatal intensive care, cause neurodevelopmental impairments. In this study, we first assessed whether SP can be detected in the brains of premature neonates at 35 weeks corrected GA using a tactile oddballomission paradigm with EEG. We then examined the effects of the degree of prematurity and of the exposure to painful care procedures on neural indices of SP. Results demonstrate the presence of repetition suppression (RS) and a mismatch response (MMR) to deviant stimuli in the contralateral somatosensory cortex of premature neonates. The amplitude of these SP proxies was significantly affected by the number of painful procedures experienced since birth, independently of the effect of GA at birth. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that greater neurodevelopmental risk would be associated with less mature SP, infants with higher exposure to pain exhibited more robust indices of SP. These findings suggest that increased ex utero experience, even painful, is associated with accelerated maturation of predictive somatosensory processing. Longitudinal follow-up of participants at age 2 will explore how these early markers relate to developmental outcomes.",

Each ReSU projects a recent window of its input history onto a canonical direction obtained via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of previously observed past-future input pairs, and then rectifies either its positive or negative component. By encoding canonical directions in synaptic weights and temporal filters, ReSUs implement a local, self-supervised algorithm for progressively constructing increasingly complex features.\n  To evaluate both computational power and biological fidelity, we trained a two-layer ReSU network in a self-supervised regime on translating natural scenes. First-layer units, each driven by a single pixel, developed temporal filters resembling those of Drosophila post-photoreceptor neurons (L1/L2 and L3), including their empirically observed adaptation to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Second-layer units, which pooled spatially over the first layer, became direction-selective -- analogous to T4 motion-detecting cells -- with learned synaptic weight patterns approximating those derived from connectomic reconstructions.\n  Together, these results suggest that ReSUs offer (i) a principled framework for modeling sensory circuits and (ii) a biologically grounded, backpropagation-free paradigm for constructing deep self-supervised neural networks.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.23144v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Decision paralysis, i.e. hesitation, freezing, or failure to act despite full knowledge and motivation, poses a challenge for choice models that assume options are already specified and readily comparable. Drawing on qualitative reports in autism research that are especially salient, we propose a computational account in which paralysis arises from convergence failure in a hierarchical decision process. We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar. Simulations in multi-option tasks reproduce key features of decision inertia and shutdown, treating autism as an extreme regime of a general, inference-based, decision-making continuum.",

    "title": "Nonlinear Dynamical Modeling of Human Intracranial Brain Activity with Flexible Inference",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.22785v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Dynamical modeling of multisite human intracranial neural recordings is essential for developing neurotechnologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Linear dynamical models are widely used for this purpose due to their interpretability and their suitability for BCIs. In particular, these models enable flexible real-time inference, even in the presence of missing neural samples, which often occur in wireless BCIs. However, neural activity can exhibit nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear models. Furthermore, while recurrent neural network models can capture nonlinearity, their inference does not directly address handling missing observations. To address this gap, recent work introduced DFINE, a deep learning framework that integrates neural networks with linear state-space models to capture nonlinearities while enabling flexible inference. However, DFINE was developed for intracortical recordings that measure localized neuronal populations. Here we extend DFINE to modeling of multisite human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. We find that DFINE significantly outperforms linear state-space models (LSSMs) in forecasting future neural activity. Furthermore, DFINE matches or exceeds the accuracy of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in neural forecasting, indicating that a linear dynamical backbone, when paired and jointly trained with nonlinear neural networks, can effectively describe the dynamics of iEEG signals while also enabling flexible inference. Additionally, DFINE handles missing observations more robustly than the baselines, demonstrating its flexible inference and utility for BCIs. Finally, DFINE's advantage over LSSM is more pronounced in high gamma spectral bands. Taken together, these findings highlight DFINE as a strong and flexible framework for modeling human iEEG dynamics, with potential applications in next-generation BCIs.",

Model-based and learning-based approaches for automated parcellation alleviate the need for manual labeling. Despite the advancement in parcellation performance, learning-based methods shift away from registration and atlas propagation without exploring the reason for the improvement compared to traditional methods. In this study, we present JParc, a joint cortical registration and parcellation framework, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art parcellation methods. In rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the enhanced performance of JParc is primarily attributable to accurate cortical registration and a learned parcellation atlas. By leveraging a shallow subnetwork to fine-tune the propagated atlas labels, JParc achieves a Dice score greater than 90% on the Mindboggle dataset, using only basic geometric features (sulcal depth, curvature) that describe cortical folding patterns. The superior accuracy of JParc can significantly increase the statistical power in brain mapping studies as well as support applications in surgical planning and many other downstream neuroscientific and clinical tasks.",

    "content": "Most children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have co-occurring language impairment, but its neural mechanisms are not well known. Excitation (E) / inhibition (I) imbalance is considered as a key neurobiological mechanism of ASD, and several electroencephalography (EEG)-based E/I balance metrics have been proposed in the previous studies. The goal of the present research was to focus on these metrics abstracted from the speech perception task to investigate their relation to language/communication in autistic youths. We used a high-density 128-channel EEG to register neural responses during speech perception task in the sex- and age-matched groups of youths with ASD (N = 162) and typically developing (TD) controls (N = 144), aged 7-18 years old. The results revealed alterations in the E/I measures in the ASD group, pointing to a higher level of excitation or neural \"noise\" in the cortex as well as broadband reduction of spectral power during speech perception. A greater neural \"noise\" reflected in the reduction of aperiodic exponent and offset was associated with lower verbal communication skills in youths with ASD. The findings suggested that the higher \"noisiness\" in the cortical systems may be a relevant marker to monitor in relation to language/communication in ASD.",

    "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

    "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

    "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "GM1-oligosaccharide rescues rotenone-impaired neuronal polarization through RhoA/ROCK modulation and mitochondrial protection",
    "content": "Neuronal polarization is a fundamental process in the formation of functional neural circuits, relying on the precise coordination between cytoskeletal regulatory signals and mechanisms that sustain cellular integrity. Disruption of these processes compromises neuronal differentiation and survival, and various neurotoxic compounds, including certain pesticides, have been associated with such dysfunctions. In this context, identifying molecules that counteract these detrimental effects is of significant therapeutic interest. Neuronal polarization is essential for the establishment of functional neural circuits and relies on coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, RhoA/ROCK signaling, and mitochondrial function. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective and neurorestorative potential of the ganglioside GM1 and its oligosaccharide derivative, osGM1, in primary hippocampal pyramidal neurons exposed to the mitochondrial neurotoxin rotenone. Rotenone induced a marked arrest of neuronal development, impaired axonal elongation, and disrupted mitochondrial organization and membrane potential. Both GM1 and osGM1 promoted recovery of neuronal polarity and axonal growth, exerting protective and restorative effects even under continuous toxin exposure, with osGM1 showing superior efficacy. Notably, osGM1 also reversed axonal growth deficits caused by pathological actin stabilization. Mechanistically, osGM1 normalized rotenone-induced hyperactivation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway without altering basal signaling and partially restored mitochondrial network integrity and function. Collectively, these findings identify osGM1 as a multi-target modulator of cytoskeletal and mitochondrial dysfunction and support its translational potential as a therapeutic strategy to counteract neurotoxin-induced neuronal damage.",

    "title": "A mouse model of CHCHD10 p.R15L familial ALS presents mild, age-related motor neuron degeneration without protein instability or mitochondrial dysfunction",
    "content": "Mutations in the mitochondrial protein CHCHD10 (D10) cause a spectrum of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders. Among these, the p.R15L variant is linked to a slowly progressive, late-onset familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with unclear pathogenic mechanisms. To better understand this, we investigated a knock-in (KI) mouse model carrying the p.R15L mutation in the endogenous protein. Unlike previously described mutant D10 KI models, p.R15L KI mice exhibited normal D10 protein levels, with no evidence of large protein aggregates. Mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide emission in mitochondria isolated from muscle and brain were unaltered. Similarly, fibroblasts from human p.R15L carriers exhibited normal D10 levels and unchanged oxidative phosphorylation function. Histochemical analyses of p.R15L KI muscle revealed mild increases in mitochondrial enzymatic activity in a subset of muscle fibers and muscle transcriptomics showed elevated expression of PGC-1, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. p.R15L KI mice developed subtle, late-onset phenotypes, including reduced body weight and motor activity and increased anxiety-like behavior. Importantly, in aged mice electrophysiological studies demonstrated decreased amplitude of the compound muscle action potential, commensurate with a moderate loss of spinal cord motor neurons and elevated serum neurofilament light levels, indicative of neurodegeneration. Together, these results indicate that the p.R15L mutation produces a mild, late-onset motor neuron phenotype in mice, partially recapitulating the human disease, without mitochondrial functional or morphological alterations. The findings indicate that p.R15L D10 selectively impairs mouse motor neurons through a gain-of-function mechanism, providing a genetically accurate yet mild in vivo model of familial ALS.",

    "content": "Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability, yet the mechanisms disrupting fetal brain development remain unclear. We performed single cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling of approximately 250,000 cells from 15 DS and 15 control human fetal cortices (10 to 20 weeks post-conception). Our analysis revealed a subtype-specific reduction in RORB/FOXP1 expressing excitatory neurons and widespread disruption of neurodevelopmental transcriptional programs. Chromosome 21 transcription factors BACH1, PKNOX1, and GABPA emerged as dosage-sensitive hubs regulating genes linked to intellectual disability. Antisense oligonucleotide mediated normalization of these factors in human neural progenitors in vitro partially rescued target gene expression. Benchmarking a humanized in vivo model captured additional molecular and cellular signatures of DS, complementing the in vitro model. Together, this resource defines the gene regulatory landscape underlying cortical development in DS and highlights candidate molecular targets and preclinical models for further investigation.",

    "title": "Gender perception of pareidolia faces in emergency department patients: the influence of physician gender",
    "content": "BackgroundThe assessment of gender perception influenced by ambiguous facial cues in patients requiring emergency medical attention remains ambiguous. Pareidolia faces represent unconscious errors in facial recognition, wherein a wide array of visual attributes contribute to the interpretation of facial features. This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying gender perception in individuals undergoing emergency medical treatment, employing an innovative digital pareidolia assessment to evaluate gender perception within the context of face pareidolia.MethodsFifty adult patients treated by a female physician in the green triage zone participated in the study. Target images consisted of face pareidolia images, while non-target images were scrambled. All images were standardized for size, tone, and light intensity. Patients instructed the pareidolia images and were asked if they discerned a face; if they answered \u2018No,\u2019 the next image was shown. If they saw a face, they identified the associated gender. Their responses and reaction times were systematically recorded digitally.ResultsOur findings revealed that, regardless of wait times, patients were significantly more likely to identify pareidolia faces as male rather than female, especially after being examined by a female physician. Additionally, male patients exhibited slightly longer reaction times than females when responding to pareidolia images.ConclusionThe outcomes of this investigation provide critical insights into the influence of pareidolia on gender perception of faces in the emergency department setting. It underscores the notion that gender biases, which arise from both biological and sociocultural factors, can affect the dynamics of patient-physician interactions.",

    "title": "A method for measuring first glymphatic influx of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer in the human brain",
    "content": "IntroductionThe glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular transport route for fluids and solutes in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serves as a conduit for solute transport and clearance of brain waste. Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the intrathecal contrast agent serves as a CSF tracer, has been developed to measure glymphatic function in humans. The normalized MRI T1 signal is a semiquantitative measure of CSF flow and exchange with the brain. Objective: To estimate first-time tracer appearance within brain tissue after intrathecal tracer injection.MethodsThis study implemented segmented regression analysis to estimate the first-time tracer appearance of an intrathecal tracer within brain tissues. An increase (breakpoint) in the normalized MRI T1 signal was defined to represent first glymphatic influx of the tracer. The study included 30 reference (REF) subjects with no identified CSF disturbance and 15 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We developed and evaluated the method in REF subjects and further compared it between the two study groups.ResultsThe time to initial glymphatic tracer enrichment in the REF cohort was approximately 1\u202fh in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cerebral cortex and ranged from two to 4\u202fh in the corresponding white matter regions. In subcortical limbic structures and basal ganglia structures, it was 0.6 and 2.2\u202fh, respectively. Compared with REF subjects, IIH patients presented a non-significant mean difference in the first appearance of \u00b10.5\u202fh in the cerebral cortex and white matter regions, with somewhat longer estimated delays in the parietal and insular white matter regions. The results are presented as time series plots and estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we provide supplementary R code, which can be adapted for use in future studies, and outline a basic assessment of true versus estimated breakpoints using simulated data.ConclusionSegmented regression was found feasible to quantify the time to first glymphatic enrichment, i.e., increase in the normalized MRI T1 signal. Moreover, the method seems reasonable to differentiate first glymphatic influx between the cohorts.",

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Enhancing Video Experiences for DHH Individuals Through Sound-Inspired Motion Caption-Based Spatiotemporal Tacton",
    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "content": "Chronic brain sensing devices, such as the Medtronic Percept\u2122 or Neuropace RNS system, record local field potentials (LFPs) that may be vulnerable to interference and noise due to hardware limitations, environmental factors, movement, stimulation, cardiac signals, and analytical procedures. Although onboard hardware filters can attenuate some unwanted signals, additional processing is often required. Here we demonstrate that cardiac artifacts significantly alter the power spectral density (PSD) of neural activity within the theta (4\u20138 Hz), alpha (8\u201312 Hz), and beta (12\u201330 Hz) bands. We introduce a time-domain template subtraction method specifically designed to remove QRS complex cardiac artifacts. Separately, we describe techniques for transforming time domain data to the frequency domain and mitigating transient artifacts by estimating background neural activity\u2014either through window rejection based on PSD characteristics or via principal component analysis. Finally, we present an approach to isolate oscillatory neural activity by subtracting the aperiodic 1/f component from the power spectrum by fitting the fitting oscillations and one over F logarithmic function. While filter selection must be tailored to the specific device and participant environment to avoid over-filtering, these interference and noise mitigation strategies are crucial for ensuring the integrity of LFP recordings.",

    "content": "To address the mismatch between current ankle rehabilitation robots and natural human motion, which affects rehabilitation efficacy, this paper uses screw theory and motion capture experiments to identify the instantaneous finite helical motion axis (IFHA) of the human ankle joint. It determines the distribution law of the IFHA and twist pitch (TP) of the ankle, and designs a human-machine motion compatible rope-driven ankle joint rehabilitation robot that meets the needs of human ankle joint rehabilitation. Firstly, human ankle motion trajectories are captured using the VICON system and IMU, and the experimental data are processed according to screw theory to obtain the distribution law of the IFHA and the range of TP. Secondly, the ankle joint's motion characteristics from the experiment inform the constraint characteristics of the rehabilitation mechanism, which are then mapped into a novel parallel rope-driven ankle rehabilitation robot to meet rehabilitation needs. Thirdly, the kinematic model of the novel mechanism is established, and its kinematic performance and singular configurations are analyzed based on the motion/force transmission index, guiding the optimization of the driving rope layout and mechanism scale parameters. Finally, an experimental platform is built to validate the human-machine motion compatibility, safety, comfort, and effectiveness of the rehabilitation robot.",

    "title": "GONet: A Generalizable Deep Learning Model for Glaucoma Detection",
    "content": "Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON), affecting an estimated 64.3 million people globally, causes irreversible vision loss when not detected early. Traditional diagnosis requires time-consuming ophthalmic examinations by specialists. Recent deep learning models for automating GON detection from colour fundus photographs (CFP) have shown promise but often suffer from limited generalizability across different ethnicities, disease groups and examination settings. To address these limitations, we introduce GONet, a robust deep learning model developed using seven independent datasets, including over 119\u2009000 CFPs with gold-standard annotations and from patients of diverse geographic backgrounds. GONet consists of a DINOv2 pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer fine-tuned using a multisource domain strategy. GONet demonstrated high out-of-distribution generalizability, with an AUC of 0.88-0.99 in target domains. GONet performance was similar or superior to state-of-the-art works and the cup-to-disc ratio, by up to 18.4%. GONet is available via Lirot.ai (www.aimlab-technion.com/lirot-ai). We also contribute a new dataset consisting of 747 CFPs with GON labels as open access, available at https://doi.org/10.13026/pdxv-m215.",

    "title": "Phase Correction of MR Spectroscopic Imaging Data Using Model-Based Signal Estimation and Extrapolation",
    "content": "Objective: To develop an effective method for phase correction of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. Methods: In many MRSI applications, it is desirable to generate absorption-mode spectra, which requires correction of phase errors in the measured MRSI data. Conventional phase correction methods are sensitive to measurement noise and baseline distortion, often resulting in distorted absorption-mode spectra from MRSI data with low-SNR and long acquisition dead time. This paper proposed a novel model-based method for improved phase correction of MRSI data. The proposed method determined the zeroth-order phase and acquisition dead time using a Lorentzian-based spectral model and performed signal extrapolation using a generalized series model. Absorption-mode spectra were then generated from the phase-corrected and extrapolated MRSI data. Results: The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated data and experimental data acquired from human subjects in multi-nuclei (31P, 2H, and 1H) MRSI experiments. Simulation results demonstrated improved parameter estimation accuracy by the proposed method under various noise levels and dead times. The proposed method also consistently generated high-quality absorption-mode spectra with minimal spectral distortions from experimental data. The proposed method was compared with state-of-the-art methods (including the entropy method and LCModel method) and showed more robust phase correction performance with less spectral distortions. Conclusion: This paper introduced a novel method for phase correction of MRSI data. Results from simulated and in vivo data demonstrated that high-quality absorption-mode spectra could be obtained using the proposed method. Significance: This method will provide a useful tool for processing MRSI data.",

    "title": "A Birdcage Volume Transmit Coil and 8 Channel Receive Array for Marmoset Brain Imaging at 7T",
    "content": "Objective: To design and fabricate a band-pass birdcage volume resonator and eight channel, conformal receive array coil for MRI of both awake and anesthetized marmoset brain at 7T. The coil is compatible with a whole body 7T clinical MRI scanner running in single channel transmit (sTx) mode. Methods: The marmoset head coil included a shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil with 24 legs, as well as 8 overlapped receive elements. Electromagnetic (EM) field simulation was performed for the 24 leg band pass birdcage Tx coil to calculate the B1+ efficiency. The efficacy of both transmit and receive coil designs were evaluated by measuring standard coil performance metrics. This was done while imaging a marmoset head phantom, as well as by acquiring in vivo, anesthetized and awake marmoset images. Results: The transmit coil along with the optimized receive array produced high resolution (0.8 mm isotropic for EPI images; 0.36 mm isotropic for structural images) and high SNR (between 50 and 80) images of the marmoset brain. The simulated B1+ efficiency of the birdcage at the center of the phantom was 2.6 \u00b5T/sqrt (W). Conclusion and significance: A shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil was designed and fabricated for marmoset brain imaging at 7T. An 8-channel receive array consisting of eight overlapped loops, covering the whole brain of the marmoset, was also constructed and applied for signal reception. The system successfully allowed scanning of both young and older marmosets. It is well-suited for longitudinal studies of marmoset brain structure. The coil advantageously allows the study of neurodevelopment and primate brain function.",

    "title": "A Hybrid Distributed Capacitance Birdcage Coil for Small-Animal MR Imaging at 14.1 T",
    "content": "Objective: To develop a transceiver radio frequency (RF) coil optimized for high resolution small-animal imaging at 14.1 T, aimed at enhancing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. Methods: A hybrid distributed capacitance (HDC) birdcage coil was designed, combining conventional endring lumped capacitors with distributed capacitance along the legs, implemented using double-layer copper-clad substrates. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations were employed to optimize the coil's structural parameters and capacitance values for maximum RF performance. The HDC birdcage coil's performance was evaluated against a conventional bandpass (BP) design through electromagnetic simulations, bench tests, and phantom imaging. In vivo validation was performed using mouse imaging. Results: EM simulations demonstrated that the HDC design enhances mean $\\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ and $\\text{B}_{1}^{-}$ field strengths by 11.8% and 11.7%, respectively, relative to the conventional BP design. The HDC design also showed reduced electric field (E-field) value in phantom, with 4.2% lower mean and 11.4% lower maximum E-field value. Bench measurements revealed a superior quality factor (Q factor) for the HDC coil, with a 34.2% higher unloaded Q value compared to the conventional design. Phantom imaging confirmed a 41% SNR improvement with the HDC design. The optimized HDC coil enabled mouse brain imaging at 50 $ \\!\\!\\mu \\!\\!\\text{ m}$ resolution.Conclusion: The proposed HDC birdcage coil demonstrated superior receiver sensitivity and Q factor compared to conventional designs, yielding significant SNR improvements in 14.1 T imaging. Significance: The results demonstrated the feasibility of achieving enhanced coil performance through HDC design at ultra-high field strength, providing a promising approach for improving image quality in small-animal MRI applications.",

    "content": "Objective. To enhance frequency recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs), particularly under short data acquisition and complex environmental conditions. Approach. We propose multi-stimulus discriminant fusion analysis (MSDFA), a novel method that integrates multi-stimulus strategies with discriminant modeling. MSDFA was evaluated on two public datasets (Benchmark and BETA) and compared with conventional approaches including eCCA, eTRCA, and their variants. Main results. MSDFA consistently outperformed existing methods across different data lengths and training block quantities. It achieved maximum information transfer rates of 247.17\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15\u2009bpm on the Benchmark dataset and 192.72\u2009\u00b1\u20099.44\u2009bpm on the BETA dataset, demonstrating superior robustness and efficiency. Significance. By combining complementary algorithmic strengths, MSDFA improves adaptability to individual variability and complex environments, advancing the practical utility and reliability of SSVEP-BCI systems.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/PSnT0EN\">https://imgur.com/PSnT0EN</a></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m the kind of developer who either forgets to commit for hours or ends up with a git log full of &quot;update,&quot; &quot;fix,&quot; and &quot;asdf.&quot; I wanted a way to document my progress without breaking my flow. This is a background watcher that handles the documentation for me.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>This tool is a local automation script built with Watchdog and Subprocess. It monitors a project directory for file saves. When you hit save, it:</p> <ol> <li>Detects the modified file.</li> <li>Extracts the diff between the live file and the last committed version using git show HEAD.</li> <li>Sends the versions to Groq (Llama-3.1-8b-instant) for a sub-second summary.</li> <li>Automatically runs git add and git commit locally.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s designed for developers who want a high-granularity history during rapid prototyping. It keeps the &quot;breadcrumb trail&quot; intact while you\u2019re in the flow, so you can look back and see exactly how a feature evolved without manual documentation effort. It is strictly for local development and does not perform any git push operations.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most auto-committers use generic timestamps or static messages, which makes history useless for debugging. Existing AI commit tools usually require a manual CLI command (e.g., git ai-commit). This project differs by being fully passive; it reacts to your editor's save event, requiring zero context switching once the script is running.</p> <p><strong>Technical Implementation</strong></p> <p>While this utilizes an LLM for message generation, the focus is the Python-driven orchestration of the Git workflow.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Uses watchdog for low-level OS file events.</li> <li><strong>Git Integration:</strong> Manages state through the subprocess module, handling edge cases like new/untracked files and preventing infinite commit loops.</li> <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> The AI is treated as a pluggable component; the prompt logic is isolated so it could be replaced by a local regex parser or a different local LLM model.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Link to Source Code:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2FDDecoene%2Fa27f68416e5eec217f84cb375fee7d70\">https://gist.github.com/DDecoene/a27f68416e5eec217f84cb375fee7d70</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MidnightBolt\"> /u/MidnightBolt </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pyly13/i_built_an_automated_git_documentation_tool_using/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pyly13/i_built_an_automated_git_documentation_tool_using/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Monolingual, Non-tone Bilingual, and Tone Bilingual Infants: Language Experiences Alter Speech and Nonspeech Perception",
    "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

    "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

    "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
    "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

    "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
    "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

    "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
    "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

    "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

    "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

    "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
    "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

    "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

    "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

    "title": "Whole-Brain Convergence of Real-World Visual Expertise beyond Faces: Meta-Analytic Evidence for Core-Adaptive Neural Architecture",
    "content": "Visual expertise-the ability to discriminate highly similar exemplars quickly and accurately within a category-supports skilled performance across real-world domains and is supported by distributed neural systems. We focus on non-face expertise to test cross-domain convergence in acquired real-world visual skills, treating faces separately because socially embedded, sensitive-period-constrained processing could blur this inference. It remains unresolved whether non-face expertise across heterogeneous domains converges on a shared, domain-general whole-brain architecture, or instead recruits domain-contingent neural configurations that vary with task and stimulus demands. We conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 22 task-fMRI studies spanning 11 real-world non-face expertise domains (579 participants, 210 peak-activation foci). Primary analysis revealed a robust, right-lateralized parieto-temporo-occipital circuit centered on the middle occipital gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus and adjoining inferior parietal lobule. We propose that this circuit constitutes a domain-general neural core that integrates fine-grained visual features with semantic associations while supporting attention-guided recognition of visually similar objects in expert performance. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses uncovered a complementary adaptive component, the engagement of which varied systematically with representational and contextual factors. Pictorial stimuli and expert-novice contrasts reliably strengthened recruitment of the right-hemisphere core, whereas symbolic stimuli engagement toward left temporal regions while selectively re-engaging right-core nodes. In addition, male-skewed samples showed attenuated left-hemisphere activation. Together, these findings delineate a stable right-hemisphere neural scaffold underlying non-face visual expertise, flexibly supplemented by left-hemisphere systems as a function of stimulus format, task demands, and demographic context, providing a whole-brain reference framework for future studies.",

    "content": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease linked to repetitive mild head impacts, but no human-based experimental system exists to study injury-induced CTE-like pathology. Here, we establish a long-lived, human multicellular in vitro brain platform in which controlled mechanical injury induces key cellular features of CTE-like pathology. Injured cultures developed persistent tau phosphorylation, axonal degeneration, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction without widespread neuronal loss, consistent with progressive pathology rather than acute toxicity. To assess physiological relevance, we integrated transcriptomic profiles from the model with postmortem human CTE brain datasets. This analysis revealed striking convergence at the level of disease-associated modules and pathways, with endothelial cells emerging as critical contributors to CTE-like transcriptional programs. Using this human-based system, we further identified delayed mitochondrial dysfunction as a prominent and sustained feature of injury-induced pathology. Together, these findings establish the first human in vitro platform for studying injury-induced CTE-like pathology and identify neurovascular and mitochondrial regulation as central components of chronic neurodegeneration following repetitive mild brain injury.",

    "title": "The critical roaming hypothesis: arousal-driven transitions across critical lines reproduce human functional connectivity dynamics",
    "content": "Ongoing brain activity displays rich temporal variability associated with efficient cognition, with functional connectivity (FC) continually reconfiguring over time. The resulting functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) specifically show complex, fat-tailed statistics that alternate between persistent epochs and faster reconfiguration transients. While nonlinear whole-brain models tuned nearby a critical point have reproduced some aspects of FCD, they fall short of capturing its full temporal complexity. We propose that slow fluctuations in arousal offer a biologically plausible mechanism for exploring critical regimes in large-scale brain dynamics and thus enrich FCD. Using a connectome-based model of coupled cortical populations, we identified phase boundaries where system dynamics transition between regimes of faster or slower FCD. We then phenomenologically incorporated arousal changes, modeling them as stochastic fluctuations in key parameters such as cortical excitability, input gain, and noise amplitude. This non-autonomous formulation enables the system to roam dynamically across regime boundaries, flexibly tuning its distance from critical transition lines and producing intermittent transitions that mirror the stochastic evolution observed in empirical FCD. Fitting these models to human resting-state fMRI and performing model comparison, we find that arousal-driven models more accurately reproduce the distinctive quantitative features of FCD with the greatest improvements coming from the previously poorly accounted fat-tailed portions of the distributions. Together, these results suggest that arousal fluctuations - likely mediated by changes in neuromodulatory tone-- shape the brain's attractor landscape over time, expanding the repertoire of accessible functional network states and providing a mechanistic basis for the complexity of spontaneous functional dynamics.",

    "title": "The neural correlates of parallel and serial search",
    "content": "For almost half a century, target distractor similarity has been known to induce different visual search modes. When a target is highly salient, it can pop out, suggesting parallel processing of all items irrespective of set size. By contrast, high similarity among items requires item-by-item comparison with an attentional template, a characteristic of serial search. Despite this long-standing distinction, little is known about the neural correlates of search modes, as typical differences in visual displays confound interpretation. Here, we contrasted the neural correlates of serial and parallel search under visually identical displays. Across distinct blocks, we biased 24 participants (21 female) toward parallel or serial search by varying target distractor similarity, thereby directing attentional focus toward a single feature or conjunction. Embedded among inducer trials, test trials were visually identical across all blocks and afforded both parallel and serial search. Behavioral analyses confirmed successful induction of distinct search modes during test trials. EEG decoding reliably discriminated search modes and these neural patterns generalized across inducer and test trials. Attentional deployment toward the target differed across search modes, revealing topographical differences in target location representations. The strength of target-location representations correlated with response times, indicating that during parallel test trials, participants switched search strategies when the target was not detected early. Moreover, target representations diverged between search modes: a temporally stable pattern emerged during serial search, suggesting reliance on working memory, whereas parallel search was characterized by more dynamic representations, likely reflecting prioritization of the relevant feature. These findings demonstrate that search history shapes search mode, giving rise to clearly distinct neural dynamics even under visually identical stimulation.",

    "title": "Slow Spindle Trains During Daytime Naps are Associated with Improved Declarative Memory Consolidation",
    "content": "Memory consolidation refers to the process by which newly encoded memories are strengthened and retained over time, and ample evidence indicates that sleep supports this process for both procedural and declarative memories. Although sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep have been associated to consolidation, it remains unclear whether all spindle types contribute equally. Spindles vary in frequency and topography - slow spindles (<=12.5Hz) predominating over frontal regions, whereas fast spindles (>12.5Hz) peak parietally - and recent work suggests that procedural memory consolidation during overnight sleep is related to the temporal organization of spindles in trains (i.e., events occurring <6s apart). Here we investigated whether a similar mechanism operates for declarative memory during daytime naps. Participants were assigned to a Nap (N=23) or No-Nap (N=15) group, and completed an object-spatial location task involving 36 item-location associations. Memory was assessed immediately after learning and again following a 90-minute nap or an equivalent wake period. Results showed that the Nap group exhibited significantly better delayed memory, as measured by combined recall-recognition score, and a greater proportion of participants maintained or improved their performance. In the Nap group, memory performance correlated with local spindle density at frontal and parietal sites, and, critically, with the proportion of slow spindles clustered in trains during NREM2. These findings suggest the temporal organization of slow spindles into clusters support declarative memory consolidation, pointing to a shared spindle-based mechanism across domains.

While several established methodologies are available to achieve this end in larval zebrafish, they are limited by the scale of tissue visualization, temporal resolution, need to restrain larvae, and/or accessibility of necessary instruments. Here, we establish a pipeline for the visualization and quantification of spatiotemporally precise whole-brain neural activity in larval zebrafish using CaMPARI2, a genetically encoded calcium indicator. Using temporally specific photoconverting UV light exposures, we capture whole-brain \"snapshots\" of neural activity time-locked to stimuli during unrestrained larval behavior. We optimize experimental conditions for establishing sub-second neuronal activity changes across acoustically-evoked behavioral paradigms spanning minutes to hours. We then leverage this system to pinpoint brain-wide neural activity changes during nonassociative habituation learning, observing distinct activity signatures in the subpallium, preoptic area, and habenulae that are altered through pharmacological disruption of habituation learning. This approach effectively complements the temporal precision achievable through post hoc activity detection methods and expands the accessibility of large-scale behavioral circuit dissection beyond highly specialized real-time volumetric imaging equipment.",

    "title": "Transcriptional Changes Fade Prior to Long-Term Memory for Sensitization of the Aplysia Siphon-Withdrawal Reflex",
    "content": "Forming a long-term memory requires changes in neuronal transcription. What happens, though, as the memory is forgotten? And how does the transcriptional state relate to the maintenance and recall of the long-term memory? To answer these questions we have been systematically tracing the time-course of transcriptional changes evoked by long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible. We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017). Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018). Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust. Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting. Thus, most transcriptional changes seem to decay more rapidly than memory expression. We discuss several possible ways that memory expression could become decoupled from detectable transcriptional regulation.",

    "title": "Intensity-dependent corticospinal facilitation by repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation: Evidence for a major contribution of group I afferents",
    "content": "Background: Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (PMS) is increasingly used in neurorehabilitation, yet the optimal stimulation intensity for inducing corticospinal facilitation and the underlying afferent mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the intensity-dependent effects of repetitive PMS on corticospinal excitability and single motor unit responses, and tested group I afferent contribution. Methods: Healthy participants received repetitive PMS (25 Hz; 2-s ON/2-s OFF) over the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) in a crossover design at 0.9x motor threshold (MT), 1.2xMT, and high intensity sufficient to induce maximal wrist dorsiflexion (mean 1.8xMT). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded from the ECR and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) before and during the intervention (total 15 min). The lasting effects were assessed after 9 min of high-intensity PMS for 50 min. To examine group I afferent contribution, the same high-intensity protocol was applied during upper-arm ischemia after reducing the ECR H-reflex to <10% of baseline. Sensory-motor input characteristics across stimulation intensities were compared using post-stimulus time histograms of ECR single motor unit firings during weak voluntary contraction. Results: High-intensity PMS significantly increased ECR MEPs after 9 min of intervention, whereas 1.2xMT of PMS required 15 min to induce a marked effect. PMS at 0.9xMT did not induce significant MEP changes. Across all intensities, the FCR MEPs remained unaltered. ECR MEPs remained markedly elevated for up to 30 min after 9 min of high-intensity PMS. In contrast, PMS delivered during ischemia produced no MEP enhancement. The motor unit analysis revealed that suprathreshold PMS elicited an early peak in firing probability--consistent with monosynaptic Ia excitation--whose amplitude increased with stimulation intensity, whereas PMS at 0.9xMT produced no discernible peak. Conclusions: Repetitive PMS above MT facilitates corticospinal excitability in an intensity-dependent manner. Facilitation was abolished during ischemia. Together with the presence of a short-latency peak in motor unit firing via a monosynaptic pathway, this finding supports a major contribution of large-diameter muscle afferents, with a substantial Ia component, to PMS-induced corticospinal facilitation.",

    "title": "Investigating the mechanisms underlying saccade generation in the frontal eye fields using multi-site microstimulation",
    "content": "The frontal eye field (FEF), a region of frontal cortex, has long been associated with the cortical control of eye movements. Classically, saccades can be reliably evoked by delivering low-intensity electrical microstimulation to the FEF. Although this makes clear the importance of FEF in the descending control of eye movements, the way in which population activity in the FEF is integrated by downstream regions to generate a motor command remains a mystery. To probe these mechanisms, we used a 16-channel microelectrode array to deliver microstimulation to the FEF of two awake, behaving monkeys. First, we found that larger current intensities were required to evoke changes in saccade direction relative to saccade amplitude when single-site saccades were evoked by stimulating a single contact on the array. Second, when stimulating two contacts simultaneously to investigate how population activity in the FEF is read out, a new polar average model more accurately predicted the amplitude and direction of dual-site saccades than traditional vector sum and vector average models. Using preexisting data from the superior colliculus (SC), we found that although the polar average model was more accurate at predicting saccade amplitude in the SC, it was no more accurate than traditional models at predicting saccade direction. Finally, when stimulating two contacts in FEF simultaneously with unequal current intensities, model accuracy depended on the amplitude of the saccades evoked by stimulating each individual site alone, suggesting that the brain may flexibly combine amplitude and direction information from the FEF to generate saccadic plans.",

    "content": "Rhythmic ability is a universal aspect of human cultures and sets the basis for musical rhythm perception and synchronization. While humans can synchronize movements to complex rhythms, it is unclear whether this capability extends to our primate ancestors. In this study, we explore whether primates can synchronize to complex rhythms and acquire rhythmic representations with generalizability akin to humans. Using controlled behavioral experiments, we provide evidence that monkeys not only can synchronize to short-long or long-short rhythms but also learn representations that generalize across a wide range of rhythm ratios and total durations. These results indicate ability to flexibly represent ratios within a relative timing framework is not exclusive to humans, but it is also present in monkeys. In addition, the produced intervals show a bias towards rhythmic categories. Notably, in an iterative tapping task, macaques and humans showed large priors for isochrony and integer ratios (2:1, 3:1). These results demonstrate a common biological foundation for rhythm synchronization in primates, extending our understanding of the shared cognitive mechanisms between primates and humans, and highlight the enormous potential of using monkeys to study the neurophysiological basis of complex rhythm perception.",

    "title": "Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.20481v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "Identification of molecular and clinical ALS subgroups based on TDP-43 loss of function molecular markers from population-based patient-derived iPS motor neurons",
    "content": "Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cortical and spinal motor neuron loss, with most patients surviving only 2-5 years post-diagnosis. While approximately 10% of cases are familial (fALS), the remaining 90% are sporadic (sALS) with unknown genetic drivers. Importantly, clinical presentations are heterogeneous in both sporadic and familial ALS, underscoring the complexity of the disease. A pathological hallmark of ALS is the mislocalization of RNA binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This mislocalization produces both loss-of-function consequences, such as widespread RNA processing and splicing defects, as well as potential toxic gain-of-function effects associated with cytoplasmic aggregation. Results: In this study, we used RT-PCR data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons derived from 180 sALS and C9orf72 fALS patients from the Answer ALS collection to identify biological subgroups based on TDP-43 loss-of-function signatures. Spectral embedding revealed four distinct molecular clusters, including one subgroup genetically similar to controls and another with the most dysregulated mRNA expression, suggesting differing disease severity. Linear mixed models were then used to assess the longitudinal trajectory of over 90 clinical measures, and the between-cluster interaction effects were evaluated. Conclusions: 36 clinical outcomes showed significant differences across clusters, supporting the presence of biologically and clinically distinct ALS subtypes based on the TDP-43-associated pathogenic cascade. These findings demonstrate a critical role of RNA profiling in uncovering biologically meaningful subtypes of ALS, potentially allowing for more precise prognostic tools and the development of future personalized therapeutic approaches.",

    "content": "The increasing prevalence of dementia underscores the pressing need for effective therapeutic interventions. Despite extensive research into A{beta}, the limited efficacy of existing treatment modalities necessitates a paradigm shift toward tau pathology including tau propagation to slow dementia progression. Here, we identified a novel protein, FAM84B (also known as LRATD2), involved in tau propagation. Elevated FAM84B levels were detected in the postmortem cortex, cerebrospinal fluid, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons of patients with tauopathy. FAM84B facilitates tau secretion through exosome assembly and RYR3-mediated exocytosis, followed by exosomal uptake into neighboring cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, thereby driving tau propagation. We confirmed that neuroinflammation induced by heightened STAT3 activity and cytokine treatment upregulated FAM84B expression, stimulating tau propagation, as evidenced by reduced propagation upon RYR3 inhibition. These findings provide invaluable insights into potential avenues for targeting tau propagation to ameliorate disease progression in tauopathies.",

    "title": "Oestradiol and Progesterone Variability in Adolescent Females: Associations with Brain Structure and Mental Health Problems",
    "content": "Objective: Adolescent females are at increased risk for adverse mental health problems, and puberty is thought to be a critical factor. Pubertal onset involves substantial variability in oestradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), yet the impact of these hormone dynamics remains unclear. We investigated whether within-individual E2 and P4 variability across one month relates to brain structure and mental health problems in adolescent females. Methods: Participants were 147 females (11 to 17 years) from the community-based, cross-sectional Puberty and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescents (PANDA) study in Australia. Salivary E2 and P4 were collected weekly for one month, with variability indexed as within-subject standard deviation. Structural MRI was acquired on the final sampling day. Mental health problems were assessed via self- and parent-report. Linear regression and mediation analyses tested associations between hormone variability, brain structure, and mental health, adjusting for demographics. Results: Greater P4 variability was associated with smaller left thalamus volume (d = -0.26, pFDR = 0.031). Higher E2 variability was associated with fewer anxiety (d = -0.170, pFDR = 0.043) and depressive symptoms (d = -0.179, pFDR = 0.036), lower emotion dysregulation (d = -0.179, pFDR = 0.036), and smaller right hippocampus volume in pre-menarchal adolescents (d = -0.192, p = 0.02). Weekly reductions in E2 predicted lower positive affect (d = 0.084, p = 0.048). Conclusion: These findings indicate that hormone variability may meaningfully shape brain and behavioural development in adolescent girls differently from hormone-related transitions in adulthood. Larger, replicable, and longer-term studies are needed to confirm these patterns.",

    "title": "Dopamine Modulation of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity for Spatio-Temporal Spike Pattern Detection in Single Neurons",
    "content": "Dopamine (DA) is an important neuromodulator that has been suggested to play key roles in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, its computational impact at the neural circuit level has not been elucidated. Here, we extended a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)-based single-neuron spatio-temporal pattern detection model by incorporating a DA input and DA-type STDP modulation. We analyzed the direct effect of the DA-type STDP curve and the effect of DA release. We found that the DA-type STDP curve accelerates learning but may promote coarse potentiation of the synaptic efficacy, which leads to false detections. It was also shown that DA can improve the pattern-detection performance up to a 44 percent success rate (2.44 times control) with no false detection, but a DA release with an excessive amount or with too short a delay induces false detection. These results suggest that DA can maintain the pattern detection ability only when released within a limited concentration and a sufficient delay.",

    "content": "Deciphering the connectome, anatomy, transcriptome and spatial-omics integrated multi-modal brain atlas and the underlying organization principles remains a great challenge. We developed a Single-cell Projectome-transcriptome In situ Deciphering Sequencing (SPIDER-Seq) technique by combining viral barcoding tracing with single-cell sequencing and spatial-omics. This empowers us to delineate a integrated single-cell spatial molecular, cellular, anatomic and projectomic atlas of mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC). The projectomic and transcriptomic cell clusters display distinct modular organization principles, but are coordinately configured in the PFC. The projection neurons gradiently occupied different territories in the PFC aligning with their wiring patterns. Importantly, they show higher co-projection probability to the downstream nuclei with reciprocal circuit connections. Moreover, we integrated projectomic atlas with their distinct spectrum of neurotransmitter/neuropeptide and the receptors-related gene profiles and depicted PFC neural signal transmission network. By which, we uncovered potential mechanisms underlying the complexity and specificity of neural transmission. Finally, leveraging machine learning, we predicted neuron projections with high accuracy by combining gene profiles and spatial information. As a proof of concept, we used this model to predict projections of fear recall engram neurons. This study facilitates our understanding of brain multi-modal network and neural computation.",

    "title": "Age-Related Changes to Olivocochlear Efferent Neurons in Mice with Pathological Hearing",
    "content": "One of the fundamental features of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is difficulty discriminating speech signals from background noise. In addition to protecting the ear from acoustic trauma, olivocochlear (OC) efferent neurons participate in signal discrimination by virtue of their inhibitory actions on auditory nerve firing. Given the time course of peripheral degeneration in ARHL, we sought to investigate the central degeneration of medial (MOC) and lateral (LOC) efferent neurons in mutant mice that exhibit genetic hearing loss or deafness at different ages. Tests of cochlear function were combined with anatomical and morphological quantification of changes to somatic number, morphology, and location of OC neurons. Neuronal tract tracing methods were employed to label OC neurons in 1-, 3-, and 6-month-old CBA/CaH mice with normal hearing; DBA/2J mice with progressive, high frequency hearing loss; and homozygous Shaker2 mice with congenital deafness. Deaf Shaker2-/- animals exhibited age-related atrophy and loss of MOCs, with contralateral MOCs more affected than ipsilateral MOCs, while LOCs were largely unaffected. No such OC degeneration was observed in DBA/2J mice, even after progressive elevation of low frequency auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) thresholds. Thus, OC efferent neurons can appear morphologically 'normal' in the complete absence of acoustic input in early life (as in deaf Shaker2-/- animals) and that the retention of these neurons is not affected by late onset high-frequency hearing loss observed in DBA/2J animals. Differential patterns of MOC neuron degeneration may affect functional plasticity of auditory brainstem feedback circuitry in ARHL.",

    "content": "Scene segmentation, a key step towards structured understanding of natural environments, entails a complementary set of computations. Instead of accessing these segmentation computations in isolation, we perceive the segregated object as a unified whole, but the neural basis supporting such a unitary percept remains unclear. We bridged this gap by showing a convergent coding scheme: an object-level additive code in the primary visual cortex, which serves as a spatial segmentation mask for the object. Across individual neurons, this code uniformly boosted their responses to the segmented object. In the population space, this code created an orthogonal representational geometry by perpendicularly displacing the neural manifold for image features, efficiently multiplexing both local and global information about the object. Computational modeling further revealed the utility and optimality of this convergent coding scheme, which effectively isolates objects in cluttered environments and in turn unclutters downstream object representations. Our findings reveal the computational logic of visual segmentation and call for a revision of the visual cortical hierarchy.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN,<p>I\u2019m a solo dev building a clinical search engine to help my wife (a resident physician) and her colleagues.<p>The Problem: Current tools (UpToDate/OpenEvidence) are expensive, slow, or increasingly heavy with pharma ads.<p>The Solution: I built Evidex to be a clean, privacy-first alternative. Search Demo (GIF): <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/zoUvINt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/zoUvINt</a><p>Technical Architecture (Search-Based RAG): Instead of using a traditional pre-indexed vector database (like Pinecone) which can serve stale data, I implemented a Real-time RAG pattern:<p>Orchestrator: A Node.js backend performs \"Smart Routing\" (regex/keyword analysis) on the query to decide which external APIs to hit (PubMed, Europe PMC, OpenAlex, or ClinicalTrials.gov).<p>Retrieval: It executes parallel fetches to these APIs at runtime to grab the top ~15 abstracts.<p>Local Data: Clinical guidelines are stored locally in SQLite and retrieved via full-text search (FTS) ensuring exact matches on medical terminology.<p>Inference: I\u2019m using Gemini 2.5 Flash to process the concatenated abstracts. The massive context window allows me to feed it distinct search results and force strict citation mapping without latency bottlenecks.<p>Workflow Tools (The \"Integration\"): I also built a \"reasoning layer\" to handle complex patient histories (Case Mode) and draft documentation (SOAP Notes). Case Mode Demo (GIF): <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/h01Zgkx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/h01Zgkx</a> Note Gen Demo (GIF): <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/DI1S2Y0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/DI1S2Y0</a><p>Why no Vector DB? In medicine, \"freshness\" is critical. If a new trial drops today, a pre-indexed vector store might miss it. My real-time approach ensures the answer includes papers published today.<p>Business Model: The clinical search is free. I plan to monetize by selling billing automation tools to hospital admins later.<p>Feedback Request: I\u2019d love feedback on the retrieval latency (fetching live APIs is slower than vector lookups) and the accuracy of the synthesized answers.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46422812\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46422812</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",

    "title": "Influence of electrode placement on the recognition of different gesture categories using high-density sEMG",
    "content": "High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)-based gesture recognition serves as a critical interface for human-computer interaction (HCI). However, recognition accuracy exhibits a significant dependency on gesture complexity and electrode positioning. To address this, we systematically investigated the relationship between gesture types and sEMG electrode placement locations through intra-subject, inter-day, and inter-subject validation protocols. Two distinct gesture categories were analyzed, i.e., single-degree-of-freedom (single-DoF) gestures and daily-used multi-finger synergistic gestures. Using an open-access gesture dataset, HD-sEMG signals were acquired from three forearm regions: the distal wrist, mid-forearm, and proximal elbow, separately. Classification results using support vector machine (SVM) revealed that single-DoF gestures achieved peak accuracy with distal wrist signals (98.63% for intra-subject, 79.73% for inter-day, and 75.47% for inter-subject validation protocols), whereas daily-used gestures performed optimally with signals from the mid-forearm and proximal elbow regions. These findings demonstrate the specific relationship between electrode placement and gesture type, providing valuable insights for EMG-HCI design and sensor placement strategies based on the nature of the target gesture.",

    "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "Learning discrete neural latent spaces for high-performance speech decoding",
    "content": "Objective. Speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which directly transform neural signals into intelligible voices, offer a promising avenue for people with aphasia. To decode speech information from brain signals, neural representation learning plays an important role. Approach. Existing studies mainly explored continuous neural latent spaces for speech decoding and ignored the intrinsic discrete property in speech production. Here, we propose to learn a discrete neural latent space by constructing a quantized representation learning network for speech decoding. Main results. Experiments with intracranial stereotactic electroencephalography signals from 11 subjects demonstrated that our approach significantly improved the precision and robustness of speech decoding. Significance. These results underscore the potential of our method to improve the functionality and usability of speech BCIs for people with aphasia.",

    "title": "A potential field shared control approach for wheelchair navigation via brain\u2013computer interface",
    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) can help patients with disabilities control external devices directly without peripheral pathways. Due to the limitations in EEG signal quality, the performance of EEG-based BCIs may not be satisfactory. Shared control has become an important research direction in the field of brain-controlled wheelchairs (BCWs). However, most existing studies do not achieve the flexible movement of BCW in environments with narrow spaces. This study proposes a shared controller based on the potential field method to integrate environmental information and user commands intelligently. Approach. Considering the flexibility of wheelchair movement, we incorporated EEG decoding results obtained through the motor imagery paradigm and fused them with environmental information to create a fusion field. We then used these components separately to construct the BCI and obstacle fields. Twelve subjects participated in the virtual wheelchair navigation experiment, while five subjects took part in the real-world wheelchair navigation experiment, aiming to evaluate the control performance in different scenarios under three control modes (keyboard, BCI-only, and shared control). Main results. The experimental results show that the proposed shared controller: 1) significantly enhances navigation performance in both general and narrow environments compared with BCI-only control; 2) improves the total success rate from 8.33% to 83.33% in virtual complex environments and from 23.33% to 66.67% in real-world two-way navigation; 3) achieves success rates that are statistically comparable to keyboard control (p > 0.05). Moreover, the shared control reduced the average navigation time by nearly 100 s compared with BCI-only control in real-world experiments. Significance. This new shared control method improves the ability of BCWs to move flexibly in challenging, narrow environments.",

    "title": "High-level locomotion intent estimation from electromyography and body posture",
    "content": "Objective. Once we learn a reliable gait, we no longer have to consciously contract individual muscles to walk, or think about the fine-grained low-level control of our joints. Instead, we mainly make decisions on where we want to end up, at what pace and through which path. Estimating this high-level (HL) intent may provide the necessary input to wearable robotic devices to adapt to their user\u2019s needs. We introduce a continuous representation of locomotion goals and investigate how it may be estimated from muscle signals and body posture. Approach. This study investigated methods to estimate a representation of HL locomotion intent, the horizontal walking path. We collected full-body motion capture and bipolar surface electromyography data from 6 subjects during non-steady-state gait. We trained temporal convolutional networks to causally predict the walking path directly or parametrically with a critically damped trajectory model, using a mixture of muscle and body posture signals. Main results. We achieved a mean trajectory estimation accuracy for a 1-second walking path corresponding to using a multimodal model. We simultaneously provided estimates for current and desired walking velocities as constrained by the walking path model, aiding interpretability of the estimator\u2019s output. Significance. Our approach could provide user interfacing in a subject-independent format for wearable robotic devices. Moreover, this HL intent representation is flexible and able to be synthesized in virtual environments, where it can serve as a surrogate for biosignals of simulated intent-driven robotics.",
