    "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
    "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

    "content": "IntroductionPostural control impairments are common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in postural instability and increased fall risk. Sensory inputs are crucial to maintain balance adequately. Additionally, fatigue is one of the common and most disabling symptoms of MS, possibly contributing to postural deficits. Previous studies have examined the effects of fatigue and altered sensory conditions on postural control in patients with MS. The present study aimed to extend this knowledge by jointly assessing these factors within the same experimental framework, providing additional insight into how fatigue modulates sensory contributions to balance.MethodsA total of 21 patients with MS (age\u202f=\u202f41.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.1\u202fyears; EDSS\u202f=\u202f1.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0; disease duration\u202f=\u202f6.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.9\u202fyears) completed balance assessments on firm and compliant surfaces with both eyes open and eyes closed, before and after a 6-min walk test used to induce fatigue. Postural sway was quantified using sway velocity and root mean square (RMS).ResultsThere was a significant effect of surface on sway velocity (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.60), with a greater sway on the compliant surface compared to the firm surface. Fatigue significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.023, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.23) but did not affect sway velocity (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). The absence of visual input (eyes closed) also significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.46). There was a significant interaction between surface and vision for sway RMS (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.54), with a larger effect of surface instability in the eyes-closed condition.DiscussionPatients with MS face increased challenges in maintaining postural control under conditions of fatigue, surface instability, and lack of visual input. Sway RMS may be more sensitive to these effects than sway velocity.",

    "content": "BackgroundInner speech\u2014the covert articulation of words in one\u2019s mind\u2014is a fundamental phenomenon in human cognition with growing interest across BCI. This pilot study evaluates and compares deep learning models for inner-speech classification using non-invasive EEG derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset (4 participants, 8 words). The study assesses a compact CNN (EEGNet) and a spectro-temporal Transformer using leave-one-subject-out validation, reporting accuracy. Macro-F1, precision, and recall.ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate and compare deep learning models for inner speech classification using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) data, derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset. The goal is to assess the performance and generalizability of two architectures: the compact convolutional EEGNet and a novel spectro-temporal Transformer.MethodsData were obtained from four healthy participants who performed structured inner speech tasks involving eight target words. EEG signals were preprocessed and segmented into epochs for each imagined word. EEGNet and Transformer models were trained using a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy. Performance metrics included accuracy, macro-averaged F1 score, precision, and recall. An ablation study examined the contribution of Transformer components, including wavelet decomposition and self-attention mechanisms.ResultsThe spectro-temporal Transformer achieved the highest classification accuracy (82.4%) and macro-F1 score (0.70), outperforming both the standard and improved EEGNet models. Discriminative power was also substantially improved by using wavelet-based time-frequency features and attention mechanisms. Results showed that confusion patterns of social word categories outperformed those of number concepts, corresponding to different mental processing strategies.ConclusionDeep learning models, in particular attention-based Transformers, demonstrate great promise in decoding internal speech from EEG. These findings lay the groundwork for non-invasive, real-time BCIs for communication rehabilitation in severely disabled patients. Future work will take into account vocabulary expansion, wider participant variety, and real-time validation in clinical settings.",

    "title": "Clinical study of wearable low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment in the improvement of executive function in obesity (the SLITE trial): protocol for a single -centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial",
    "content": "IntroductionObesity is a global health crisis associated with significant physical and cognitive impairments, particularly in executive function. Impaired executive function exacerbates unhealthy eating behaviors and hinders effective weight management. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation have demonstrated potential in improving executive function and assisting in weight reduction but face limitations in accessibility and efficacy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) represents an emerging neuromodulation technique distinguished by its non-invasive application and superior spatial resolution, facilitating targeted modulation of cortical activity and neural excitability with high precision. This study aims to explore the efficacy of LIPUS on executive function in obesity.Methods and analysisThis study adopts a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled design. A total of 44 participants diagnosed with obesity (BMI \u2265 28 kg/m2) will be enrolled and equally assigned to the LIPUS and sham groups. The LIPUS group will receive pulsed therapeutic ultrasound for 4 weeks, while the sham group will receive placebo treatment using a device delivering no therapeutic ultrasound. Both groups will undergo assessments at baseline and after 4 weeks, with the primary outcome being the change in reaction time on the food Go/No-go task. Secondary outcomes include changes in body weight, BMI, food cravings (measured by the Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait and State versions), food-eating behavior (measured by the Visual Analog Scale and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire), and cognitive performance as assessed by the Stroop test. Additional neuroimaging assessments will include functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG).DiscussionThis trial will be the first to evaluate LIPUS for enhancing executive function in individuals with obesity. By combining wearable ultrasound technology with neuroimaging assessments, the study is expected to provide novel evidence for the neuromodulatory role of LIPUS. The results may support the development of innovative, non-invasive strategies for obesity management and inform future clinical applications.",

    "content": "Chronic pain affects up to 60% of the population and not only impairs physical function but also leads to multidimensional neurocognitive deficits, including diminished attention, working memory impairment, and executive dysfunction. Clinical studies indicate that chronic pain induces gray matter atrophy in key brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, along with disrupted functional connectivity and other pathological alterations. Despite extensive research, the precise pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unclear, making this a central focus of current investigations. In this review, we examine the morphological and functional changes in these critical brain regions from an anatomical perspective. By integrating cellular and molecular insights, we elucidate the multi-level mechanisms underlying chronic pain-induced cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we summarize current therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatments, neuromodulation, and behavioral interventions, and discuss promising directions for future research. By synthesizing recent advances, this review aims to enhance understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of chronic pain, thereby informing the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

Despite expanding recognition, diagnosis is often delayed because early neuroimaging may be normal and vasoconstriction peaks in weeks two to three, and management remains experience-based rather than trial-anchored. In this mini-review we summarize advances in clinicoradiological definition and pathophysiology of tone dysregulation, outline risk-stratified diagnostic pathways built on serial CTA/MRA with confirmatory DSA when needed, high-resolution vessel-wall MRI to exclude inflammatory arteriopathy, perfusion MRI/CT and arterial spin labeling, and bedside transcranial Doppler, and appraise translational opportunities spanning time-anchored surveillance, perfusion-preserving care bundles and pragmatic endpoints. We also discuss enduring challenges\u2014including nosological overlap with primary CNS vasculitis, non-standardized imaging schedules, heterogeneous blood-pressure targets and a paucity of randomized data\u2014that temper implementation. By integrating time-aware vascular and perfusion readouts (e.g., planned week-2\u20133 repeat angiography, ASL hypoperfusion mapping, sustained Doppler velocities) with trigger withdrawal, cautious blood-pressure management and symptomatic vasodilators such as calcium-channel blockers and magnesium in selected contexts, emerging strategies aim to preserve cerebral perfusion, anticipate delayed infarction and standardize follow-up across settings. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of RCVS care and outlines pragmatic standards and avenues for prospective evaluation. We hope these insights will assist researchers and clinicians as they endeavor to implement more effective, individualized regimens.",

    "content": "ObjectiveColor and spatial location are key cues influencing visual selection in binocular color rivalry, jointly modulating attentional resource allocation and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. However, how these cues\u2014individually and in combination\u2014regulate ocular behavior and PFC activation remains insufficiently understood and lacks systematic empirical investigation.MethodsThis study integrates eye tracking, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and reaction time measurements to systematically investigate the cortical and oculomotor response characteristics under a binocular rivalry paradigm, focusing on color rivalry (Color stimuli), spatial location (Location stimuli), and their combined (Color & Location stimuli).ResultsThe results revealed that Color stimuli elicited rapid saccades, significant pupil dilation, and a decrease in prefrontal HbO concentration. Location stimuli induced stable saccadic patterns and a typical biphasic HbR response in BA46. The combined Color & Location stimuli triggered significant changes in oculomotor behavior during the later processing stage, accompanied by a marked increase in HbO activation in BA10, suggesting its dominant role in multisensory integration and cognitive resource reallocation. Further coupling analyses showed a significant positive correlation between prefrontal HbO concentration and reaction time (r = 0.555, p < 0.01), and a significant negative correlation between HbO concentration and saccade amplitude (r = \u20130.376, p < 0.05), consistent with the theoretical predictions of the \u201cneural efficiency\u2013cognitive load trade-off\u201d model. Task-dependent coupling relationship were also observed among oculomotor parameters and between eye movement and cerebral hemodynamic signals.ConclusionColor stimuli induce rapid saccadic behavior and impose higher prefrontal load, Location stimuli engage a more efficient dorsal pathway, while Color & Location stimuli intensify resource rivalry and induce a processing bottleneck, manifested as prolonged reaction times co-occurring with heightened cortical activation.",

Fifty-four CONC-CI participants, diagnosed with persisting concussion symptoms between one- and six-months post-injury, were analyzed in group-level results.ResultsFunctional activity in the vergence oculomotor network, specifically the frontal eye fields, supplemental eye fields, parietal eye fields, cerebellar vermis (CV), and visual cortex, increased post-OBVAM compared to baseline assessments. Significant increases in post-OBVAM compared to baseline assessments were observed in the visual cortex (bilateral V3 and right area PH) and the CV, via a paired t-test with family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The pooled baseline and post-OBVAM measures revealed that the bilateral functional activities of V3 and CV were significantly correlated with the NPC, PFV, and VF clinical signs, and the right hemisphere area PH within the visual cortex was significantly correlated with VF (Bonferroni-corrected; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To determine whether the CONC-CI post-OBVAM functional brain activity differed from that of the binocularly normal control (BNC) data, an unpaired t-test was performed comparing 46 age-matched BNC datasets with 54 CONC-CI datasets. Significant differences in functional activity between BNC and CONC-CI at post-OBVAM datasets were not observed (p\u202f>\u202f0.05).DiscussionResults support that OBVAM improves functional brain activity in CONC-CI correlated with NPC, PFV, and VF.",

    "title": "Optimizing real-time phase detection in diverse rhythmic biological signals for phase-specific neurostimulation",
    "content": "Objective. Closed-loop, phase-specific neurostimulation is a powerful method to modulate ongoing brain activity for clinical and research applications. Phase-specific stimulation relies on estimating the phase of an ongoing oscillation in real time and issuing a control command at a target phase. Phase detection algorithms based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are widely used due to their computational efficiency and robustness. However, it is unclear how algorithm performance depends on the spectral properties of the input signal and how algorithm parameters can be optimized. Approach. We evaluated the in silico performance of three phase detection algorithms [Endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT), Hilbert transform (HT), and phase mapping (PM)] on three real-world biological signals with distinct spectral properties (theta oscillations from rodent hippocampal local field potential, alpha oscillations from human electroencephalogram (EEG), and hand movement kinematics from essential tremor patients) to identify the optimal model and parameters. We then validated the performance of an algorithm for estimating theta phase in real-time using rats implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus. Results. First, we found that signal amplitude and frequency variations strongly influence algorithm performance. Frequency-specific signal-to-noise ratio was positively correlated with performance (mean R2 = 0.42 across metrics), while amplitude and frequency variability were negatively correlated (mean R2 = 0.50 across metrics). Second, we showed that the length of the data window used for phase estimation is the key parameter for optimal performance of FFT-based algorithms, where the optimal data window length corresponds to the period of the oscillation (\u223c150 ms for hippocampal theta oscillations, \u223c100 ms for human EEG alpha, and \u223c125 ms for essential tremor kinematics). We validated this finding in vivo by estimating the phase of theta oscillations from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, where a data window length corresponding to one theta cycle yielded the best performance across all metrics compared with shorter or longer window lengths. Significance. Our findings clarify the relationship between signal properties and algorithm performance and provide a convenient method for optimizing FFT-based phase detection algorithms. We show that a data window length corresponding to one cycle of an oscillation can lead to improved performance.",

In referable DR, LLD is larger as a result of LLVA decline, whereas in quiescent PDR smaller LLD reflects a greater decline in BCVA. These findings emphasize the nuanced relationship of LLD with photopic and mesopic visual functions, which decline in distinct patterns across DR stages. LLD may serve as a simple and practical tool for monitoring macular ischemia progression...",

Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of...",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis.

    "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
    "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

    "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "title": "Advancements in the application of multimodal monitoring and machine learning for the development of personalized therapeutic strategies in traumatic brain injury",
    "content": "Trauma is the fourth leading cause of death globally and the primary cause of mortality in the 15\u201345 age group, with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the core of trauma care. Annually, over 50 million TBI patients are reported worldwide. The complex and heterogeneous pathophysiology of TBI presents substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. In recent years, multimodal monitoring has emerged as a crucial tool to guide clinical management. The integration of multimodal monitoring with machine learning offers novel opportunities for TBI assessment and management, given the rapid development and widespread application of machine learning approaches. Therapeutic hypothermia has shown potential neuroprotective benefits in experimental and clinical contexts, though evidence remains mixed and its implementation in practice faces significant challenges. This review summarizes recent advancements in multimodal monitoring and explores how machine learning can optimize the application of therapeutic hypothermia in conjunction with multimodal data. For example, predictive models trained on multimodal signals (e.g., EEG, ICP, cerebral blood flow, and oxygenation) can help identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit from targeted temperature management. By enabling such stratification and adaptive treatment strategies, machine learning may support the development of more personalized and effective therapeutic approaches for TBI.",

    "title": "Altered periodic and aperiodic activities in patients with disorders of consciousness",
    "content": "IntroductionDisorders of consciousness (DoC), including unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS), are primarily diagnosed behaviorally. Recent evidence indicates that loss of consciousness manifests as irregularities in neural oscillatory activity across delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. However, conventional spectral analysis often conflates periodic oscillations with aperiodic 1/f components, potentially obscuring consciousness-related dynamics.MethodsTo elucidate the mechanistic basis of spectral alterations in consciousness impairment, we compared oscillatory and aperiodic activity patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of patients with different consciousness levels. We further examined the spatiotemporal variability of these neural signatures and rigorously evaluated their discriminative power for state classification using support vector machine (SVM) analysis.ResultsWhile periodic and aperiodic activities are independent, our results indicate that both components exhibit significant differences between groups at both local and global scales. Critically, higher spatial and temporal variability of aperiodic features (spectral exponent) were correlated with preserved consciousness. When distinguishing UWS from MCS, the combination of periodic and aperiodic features significantly improved classification performance compared to using either metric alone.DiscussionOur findings demonstrate that both periodic oscillations and aperiodic activity provide valuable information about consciousness levels. Critically, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the aperiodic component serve as a key marker of brain state. This underscores the necessity of accounting for aperiodic activity in mechanistic studies and clinical assessments of DoC.",

    "title": "Patient-specific and interpretable deep brain stimulation optimisation using MRI and clinical review data",
    "content": "BackgroundOptimisation of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) settings is a key aspect in achieving clinical efficacy in movement disorders, such as the Parkinson\u2019s disease. Modern techniques attempt to solve the problem through data-intensive statistical and machine learning approaches, adding significant overhead to the existing clinical workflows. Here, we present a geometry-based optimisation approach for DBS electrode contact and current selection, grounded in routinely collected MRI data, well-established tools (Lead-DBS) and optionally, clinical review records.MethodsThe pipeline, packaged in a cross-platform tool, uses lead reconstruction data and simulation of Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA) to estimate the contacts in optimal position relative to the target structure, and suggests optimal stimulation current. The tool then allows further interactive user optimisation of the current settings. Existing electrode contact evaluations can be optionally included in the calculation process for further fine-tuning and adverse effect avoidance.ResultsBased on a sample of 174 implanted electrode reconstructions from 87 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, we demonstrate that our algorithm\u2019s DBS parameter settings are more effective in covering the target structure (Wilcoxon p\u202f<\u202f5e-13, Hedges\u2019 g\u202f>\u202f0.94) and minimising electric field leakage to neighbouring regions (p\u202f<\u202f2e-10, g\u202f>\u202f0.46) compared to expert parameter settings. Retrospective analysis of a limited subset (n\u202f=\u202f50) predicts comparable improved motor outcomes with expert settings (g\u202f=\u202f0.05\u20130.08, p\u202f=\u202f0.09\u20131), suggesting potential for similar clinical efficacy, pending prospective validation.ConclusionThe proposed automated method for optimisation of the DBS electrode contact and current selection shows promising results and is readily applicable to existing clinical workflows. We demonstrate that the algorithmically selected contacts perform better than manual selections according to electric field calculations, without the iterative optimisation procedure.",

You can find the repository <a href=\"https://github.com/mrmn2/PdfDing\">here</a>. As always I would be quite happy about a star and you trying out the application.</p> <p>Last week PdfDing was selected to receive a grant from the <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/news/2025/20251016-selection-NGI0CommonsFund.html\">NGI Zero Commons Fund</a>.

The exact sum of the grant still needs to be discussed, but obviously I am very stocked to have been selected and need to share it with the community.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>PdfDing's features include:</p> <ul> <li>Seamless browser based PDF viewing on multiple devices. Remembers current position - continue where you stopped reading</li> <li>Stay on top of your PDF collection with multi-level tagging, starring and archiving functionalities</li> <li>Edit PDFs by adding comments, highlighting and drawings</li> <li>Manage and export PDF highlights and comments in dedicated sections</li> <li>Clean, intuitive UI with dark mode, inverted color mode, custom theme colors and multiple layouts</li> <li>SSO support via OIDC</li> <li>Share PDFs with an external audience via a link or a QR Code with optional access control</li> <li>Markdown Notes</li> <li>Progress bars show the reading progress of each PDF at a quick glance</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>As PDF is an omnipresent file type PdfDing has quite a diverse target group, including:</p> <ul> <li>Avid readers (e.g. me) that want to seamlessly read PDFs on multiple devices</li> <li>Hobbyist, that want to make their content available to other users. For example one user wants to share his automotive literature (manuals, brochures etc) with fellow enthusiasts.</li> <li>Researchers and students trying to stay on top of there big PDF collection</li> <li>Small businesses that want to share PDFs with their customers or employees. Think of a small office where PDF based instructions to different appliances can be opened by scanning a QR on the appliance.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Currently there is no other solution that can be used as a drop in replacement for PdfDing. I started developing PdfDing because there was no available solution that satisfied the following (already implemented) requirements:</p> <ul> <li>Complete control over my data.</li> <li>Easy to self-host via docker. PdfDing can be used with a SQLite database -&gt; No other containers necessary</li> <li>Lightweight and minimal, should run on cheap hardware</li> <li>Continue reading where you left off on all devices</li> <li>Browser based</li> <li>Support single sign on via OIDC in order to leverage an existing identity provider</li> <li>PDFs should be shareable with an external audience with optional access control</li> <li>Open source</li> <li>Content should not be curated by an admin instead every user should be able to upload PDFs via the UI</li> </ul> <p>Surprisingly, there was no solution available that could do this.

    "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks).

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

We present a boy with EE-SWAS who was treated with VNS at 4.8\u202fyears of age.Case presentationA male patient developed seizures at 2.3\u202fyears of age. At 2.8\u202fyears of age, electroencephalography (EEG) showed SWAS, leading to regression in cognitive, motor, and language functions. Administration of multiple anti-seizure medications (ASMs) achieved poor efficacy, and repeated corticosteroids resulted in only transient improvement. He was treated with VNS at 4.8\u202fyears of age. Seizure freedom was achieved at 1.3\u202fyears postoperatively. The SWAS pattern was not observed on follow-up EEG 2\u202fyears after implantation. Concurrently, his neurodevelopment improved. No new ASMs or corticosteroids were added during this period. VNS was interrupted due to pulse generator battery depletion at 5.6\u202fyears after implantation. Increased SWI was showed on the EEG 6\u202fmonths after the interruption of stimulation.ConclusionEarly VNS intervention should be considered in addition to conventional medication for young children with SWAS who have greater distance from the self-limited age.",

    "content": "Objective. Spike sorting, which involves detecting and attributing spikes to their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, is a common process in electrophysiology and brain\u2013computer interface systems. Recent advances in large-scale neural recording technologies are challenging the conventional algorithms because of the intensive computational workloads required and the accuracy degradation suffered from time-variant spike patterns and significant levels of noise. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated promising performance in processing these large-scale neural recordings. However, their applications are constrained by the labor-intensive data labeling and the lack of fully vectorized frameworks with end-to-end NNs. Approach. We propose E-Sort, an end-to-end NN-based spike sorter with transfer learning and parallelizable post-processing to address both obstacles. Main results. We examined our framework in both synthetic and real datasets. The results of the processing of the synthetic datasets show that our approach can reduce the number of annotated spikes required for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.7% higher accuracy. We evaluated E-Sort on various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift patterns, which demonstrates that our design can achieve an accuracy that is comparable with Kilosort4 while sorting 50\u2009s of data in only 1.32\u2009s. To test with real datasets, we first sorted the spikes using Kilosort4 and used the sorted spikes at the initial period to pre-train the NN; then we compared and measured the agreement between the results from the trained model and those from Kilosort4. On average the pre-training process improved the result agreement by 30% approximately. Significance. E-Sort offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate NN-based framework for large-scale spike sorting, significantly reducing manual labeling effort and processing time.",

However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "IntroductionNative and non-native listeners rely on different neural strategies when processing speech in their respective native and non-native languages, encoding distinct features of speech from acoustic to linguistic content in different ways. This study investigated differences in neural responses between native English and Korean speaker when they passively listened to speech in their native and non-native languages using electroencephalography.MethodsThe study employed two approaches to examine neural responses: Temporal Response Functions (TRFs) measure how the brain tracks continuous speech features (i.e., speech envelope, phoneme onset, phonemic surprisal, and semantic dissimilarity), and Phoneme-Related Potentials (PRPs) assess phonemic-level processes.ResultsNon-native speakers showed significantly stronger neural tracking of the speech envelope, but no group differences for higher-level linguistic features within analyses of TRFs. PRP analyses, however, revealed distinct response patterns across phoneme categories, with non-native speakers showing heightened peaks.ConclusionThe results suggest that non-native speakers rely more on bottom-up acoustic cues during passive listening. TRFs and PRPs provide information on neural markers that indicate how speech is processed differently depending on the listener's native language and language experience.",

    "content": "Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a widespread condition with profound psychological, educational, and occupational consequences. Despite increasing academic attention, few studies have systematically mapped the thematic development of PSA research or anticipated future directions. This study employs a semantically enriched framework integrating latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with Word2Vec to analyze 990 peer-reviewed journal articles (1995\u20132024) retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection, spanning SSCI, SCI-Expanded, ESCI, and A&amp;HCI indices. Nine major thematic clusters are identified, covering topics such as mental health distress, physiological reactivity, language apprehension, social phobia, and virtual reality interventions. Thematic evolution across four historical phases reveals growing conceptual convergence and an increasing focus on digital anxiety and assessment technologies. A Sankey diagram illustrates patterns of thematic continuity and transformation, highlighting both enduring topics and emerging lines of inquiry. To predict future research frontiers, two novelty indicators\u2014Cluster Novelty and Topic Novelty\u2014are introduced. Clusters focused on language learning (Topic 4), virtual therapy (Topic 6), and psychometric tools (Topic 8) emerge as the most temporally novel.

    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "BackgroundGambling Disorder (GD) is a behavioral addiction marked by impaired decision-making and poor impulse control. We investigated whether resting-state interhemispheric quantitative EEG (qEEG) coherence\u2014a measure of functional connectivity between homologous cortical regions\u2014could serve as a biomarker of GD.MethodsTwenty-nine male patients with GD and 45 healthy male controls underwent resting-state qEEG recording. Coherence was computed for homologous electrode pairs across delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. Group differences were analyzed using independent-samples t-tests; associations with disorder duration were assessed via age-controlled partial correlations.ResultsConsistent with our hypothesis, GD participants exhibited frontal pole hypercoherence (Fp1\u2013Fp2) across delta, theta, and beta bands, which is likely influenced by prefrontal/orbitofrontal generators. In contrast, GD showed hypocoherence in temporal (T3\u2013T4, T5\u2013T6), central (C3\u2013C4), and parietal (P3\u2013P4) regions across these frequencies. Greater disorder duration was associated with lower beta coherence at F3\u2013F4 and Fp1\u2013Fp2, and higher delta coherence at O1\u2013O2.ConclusionsThese findings reveal a dual pattern of interhemispheric connectivity disruption in GD\u2014hypercoherence at frontal pole sites and hypocoherence in sensorimotor and attentional posterior networks\u2014supporting theoretical models of addiction neurocircuitry. Resting-state qEEG coherence holds promise as a clinically relevant biomarker for GD and may inform the development of neuromodulatory interventions aimed at network rebalancing.",

    "content": "BackgroundAPOE4 and APP are two of the main genetic risk factors for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Although there have been suggestions that these two factors interact, most of the in vivo evidence for such interactions comes from transgenic mouse models that suffer from complications associated with protein overexpression. Our goal was to examine the consequences of interactions between APOE4 and APP on brain function while avoiding the use of transgenic mice.MethodsWe generated and characterized double-mutant knock-in mice incorporating familial APP mutations and humanized APOE4.ResultsIn the brains of 3-month-old double-mutant mice there were significant alterations in vascular remodeling genes, vascular structure and blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. These changes were not observed in either APOE4 or APP single-mutant mice and, thus, were caused by interactions between the two genes. These interaction effects were transient, because they were absent in 8-month-old double-mutant mice.ConclusionThese findings indicate that early vascular changes, driven by the interaction of APP and APOE4, may influence the progression of AD. Our work highlights the need to focus on the synergistic vascular actions of APOE4 and APP, particularly at younger ages.",

    "content": "Objective. Chronic pain affects over 20% of the adult population in the United States, posing a substantial personal as well as economic burden and contributing to the ongoing opioid crisis. Effective, non-addictive chronic pain treatments are urgently needed. Traditional drug discovery methods have failed to identify novel, non-addictive compounds, highlighting the need for alternative approaches such as phenotypic screening. Our lab developed a phenotypic screening assay using extracellular electrophysiological recordings from co-cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cell sensory neurons and glia. This study aimed to identify responsive neuronal subtypes within these presumptively heterogeneous cultures. Approach. We induced an inflammation-like state using tumor necrosis factor alpha and evaluated acute responses to nociceptor agonist capsaicin, which targets transient receptor potential vanilloid-1. By employing unsupervised learning, we labeled responsive cells based on changes in mean firing rates (MFR). We then used the labeled cells\u2019 baseline activity to train and validate five classifiers. Main results. None of the classifiers outperformed the others in regards to accuracy. Nonetheless, an RUS-boosted ensemble of decision trees achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.877 classifying nociceptors in an unseen labeled culture. Significance. The notable accuracy suggests that machine learning techniques could be employed to enhance microelectrode array-based neuronal phenotypic assays as readouts (e.g. MFR) can be weighted based on target cell type (e.g. nociceptors).",

In a proof-of-concept driving simulator study, we evaluated a hazard warning device designed for vision impaired drivers. Three groups participated: 11 persons with central vision loss (CVL; median age 60 years), 12 with homonymous field loss (HFL; 52 years) and 11 with normal vision (NV; 60 years). CVL is characterized by impaired visual acuity and contrast sensitivity while HFL is a loss of vision in the same half of the visual...",

The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "This study aims to develop the Dream Incubation Attitude Scale for assessing attitudes toward dream incubation. The Dream Incubation Attitude Scale underwent psychometric testing based on responses drawn from 109 Hong Kong participants. This resulted in a three-factor structure comprising self-efficacy, skepticism, and challenge, each exhibiting strong internal consistency with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 values ranging from .72 to .89. Concurrent validity was established through small to moderate correlations with the Dream Attitude Scale. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Flying dreams stimulated by targeted movement and sound: Art and science in the dream hotel.",
    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "title": "Nightmare disorder in women.",
    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

    "content": "The aim of this study was to assess whether participants who present more frequently with nightmares or distressing dreams have had traumatic experiences in their childhood and their relationship with current personality traits. Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

    "content": "This study examines the relationship between employment status and dream content using a data set of 6,478 dream reports collected from Reddit. We used machine learning to analyze thematic differences between unemployed individuals and a control group. The results revealed that the dreams of unemployed individuals demonstrated an underrepresentation of surprise and visual observations alongside an overrepresentation of work-related topics. These patterns suggest that unemployment is associated with distinct alterations in dream content, reflecting reduced cognitive engagement and heightened preoccupation with occupational concerns. This study establishes the feasibility of leveraging large-scale, publicly available data to explore the dream content of subpopulations.

    "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice.

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning.

    "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

    "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

    "content": "Avoiding actions with negative consequences is fundamental to adaptive behaviour, yet individuals differ drastically in their tendencies to avoid to punishment. Using a conditioned punishment task in male and female rats, we replicate findings of a bimodal distribution of punishment avoidance, and identify four distinct behavioural phenotypes (Sensitive, Hypersensitive, Insensitive, Generalised) that differed in their punishment avoidance, unpunished reward-seeking, and Pavlovian fear. We examined how these phenotypic differences related to c-Fos (transcriptional activity marker) across prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions. While region-level c-Fos differences were minimal, covariance and graph-theoretic analyses revealed three functional PFC networks predominantly composed of medial PFC, ventrolateral PFC, or sensorimotor regions. Activity in the ventrolateral PFC network predicted punishment avoidance, while activity in the medial PFC network predicted generalised suppression during initial punishment learning. These findings suggest phenotypic differences in punishment sensitivity is underpinned by differential recruitment of distinct cortical networks that drive adaptive versus maladaptive responses to negative outcomes.",

    "title": "Butyrate regulates the blood-brain barrier transport and intra-endothelial accumulation of Alzheimers disease Amyloid-beta peptides",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the pathological deposition of amyloid beta (A) proteins as amyloid plaques, tau aggregates, and cerebrovascular dysfunction that drive disease progression. Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, has been found to be reduced in AD patients; butyrate supplementation improved cognition and decreased amyloid burden in animal models. However, the precise underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling impacts A transport kinetics at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we investigated the effect of butyrate treatment on intra-endothelial A accumulation and BBB integrity by modulating the insulin signaling pathway. The effect of butyrate on A accumulation was assessed by flow cytometry in BBB cell culture models. Insulin signaling activation and the expression of various receptors and transporters at the BBB were evaluated by Western blots and confocal microscopy. The roles of various molecular mediators were confirmed using specific inhibitors (MK2206, Trametinib, Rapamycin, VX-745). The effect of butyrate on the expression of BBB receptors and transporters that play a critical role in A trafficking was examined in mouse brains colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria via immunohistochemistry. Butyrate significantly decreased A{beta}42 accumulation in endothelial cells. This effect was associated with insulin signaling pathway activation, particularly AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Inhibitor studies established the critical role of these specific arms, as co-incubation with MK2206 (AKT inhibitor) or Trametinib (ERK inhibitor) reversed the protective effect of butyrate and increased A{beta}42 accumulation. However, mTOR and p38 inhibitors did not show a similar effect. In addition, butyrate restored P-glycoprotein efflux transporter expression and claudin-5 tight junction protein levels that were reduced with A{beta} treatment. These effects were supported by in vivo work, which demonstrated the upregulation of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). This protein is associated with AKT activation and extracellular matrix stabilization in mice colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that butyrate decreases A{beta}42 uptake at the BBB endothelium by activating the AKT and ERK arms of the insulin signaling pathway. These changes may also improve the integrity of BBB tight junctions by increasing claudin-5 expression and extracellular matrix, and by upregulating TIMP-2 expression. This study highlights butyrate's potential as a therapeutic modulator of AD-related BBB dysfunction.",

    "title": "Ketamine strengthens synaptic inputs to the dorsal raphe to boost serotonergic activity: pivotal for rapid antidepressant-like effects",
    "content": "Ketamine at subanaesthetic dose is known as a fast-acting antidepressant (AD), able to facilitate synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or the hippocampus. However, its influence on the serotonergic (5-HT) system is more confusing as it loses its behavioral effects in 5-HT-depleted animals, but does not modify 5-HT neuron function. We hypothesized that this discrepancy was due to the different temporal scales chosen in the related studies. We performed electrophysiological recordings of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and microdialysis measurements of 5-HT release in the ventral hippocampus of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Experiments were designed to collect the results over a long duration, i.e. 4-5 hours after the injection. Levels of the pro-neuroplastic factors PSD-95 and Synapsin-1 in the DRN were also assessed, as was cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG). 5-HT neuron mean firing rate was unmodified within the 2 h that followed ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), but strongly (90%) increased in the 2-5 h time bin, an effect abolished by lesioning the mPFC or administering the mTOR inhibitor Torin-2. A similar kinetics was found for hippocampal 5-HT release. Synapsin-1 and PSD-95 mRNA transcriptions were enhanced at 2 h, and PSD-95 protein levels appeared to peak at 24 h. Finally, DG mitogenesis was enhanced 48 h post-injection, an augmentation suppressed in 5-HT-depleted animals. Low-dose ketamine provokes a neuroplastic wave originating in the mPFC and emerging in the hippocampus, a transfer in which the 5-HT system appears to act as an integrative hub of plasticity.",

    "title": "Distinct response selectivity changes in primary visual and parietal cortex during visual discrimination learning",
    "content": "When animals learn the behavioral relevance of sensory features, response selectivity in primary sensory areas increases for those features. However, the effect of learning on neuronal activity in higher-level areas associated with decision-making in the parietal cortex, compared to primary sensory cortex, is not yet known. We used two-photon calcium imaging to determine how learning modifies neural representations in primary visual cortex (V1) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in a visual go/no-go orientation discrimination task. We found that behavior improvements after learning were associated with increased neuronal selectivity in both V1 and PPC. The increased selectivity in PPC was mainly driven by neurons preferring the rewarded go stimulus, while, in V1, neurons increased their selectivity for both the rewarded go and unrewarded no-go stimulus. Furthermore, feature preference was robust in V1 neurons but reorganized in PPC after learning. Finally, feature preference was preserved across contexts in V1 but not in PPC after learning, where many neurons switched their preference to the rewarded feature during active task engagement. Our results demonstrate that learning a visually-guided discrimination task increased information about relevant sensory features through distinct changes in the bottom and top levels of the visual cortical hierarchy. Visual cortex neurons encode visual features with increased reliability but with preserved feature preferences, while parietal neurons reorganize their feature preferences in a task-specific manner.",

    "title": "Visual working memory-related saccade biases are amplified by task demands, without updating working memory content",
    "content": "Visual working memory (VWM) and oculomotor control exert bi-directional influences on each other: eye movements during memory delays can influence VWM performance, and VWM content can bias the execution of eye movements. Oculomotor capture has been shown to extend to automatic, corrective saccades that can be biased towards distractors whose feature matches VWM content. We address the question of bi-directional influences between VWM and the oculomotor system, here with a focus on corrective saccade biases. 20 participants had to memorize a color hue and later discriminate it from another hue from a different (Easy condition) or the same color category (Difficult condition). Between encoding and test, they performed a gaze-contingent saccade task where, mid-saccade, the position of items shifted, introducing an artificial saccade error, and the color of a distractor neighboring the target changed to a color (mis)matching the memorized one. VWM performance was higher in the Easy compared to the Difficult experimental block, reflecting the successful manipulation of task demands. Corrective saccade biases towards the distractor occurred more frequently when it matched memory content compared to when it did not, replicating previous findings. Importantly, they also occurred more in the Difficult experimental block, which required stronger VWM representations than the Easy condition. VWM performance, however, was not affected by saccade corrections to memory (mis)matching distractors. Our results provided no evidence of saccade biases having a role in the updating of VWM content, however they indicate an influence of task demands and VWM engagement on automatic oculomotor biases.",

    "title": "Phosphoproteomic profiling reveals post-translational dysregulation in Huntington's disease patient-derived neurons",
    "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although transcriptomic and proteomic changes have been characterized in patient-derived neurons, the contribution of post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, remains poorly understood. Here, we present the first phosphoproteomic analysis by mass spectrometry (P-MS) of human induced neurons (iNs) directly reprogrammed from HD patient fibroblasts. We identified 177 phosphopeptides with significantly altered abundance in HD-iNs, mapping to phosphoproteins associated with key signaling pathways known to be affected in HD, such as splicing and autophagy. By integrating P-MS data with previously published proteomic and transcriptomic data from the same donors, we identified distinct subsets of ON-OFF phosphopeptides that exhibited a complete loss of phosphorylation in either HD- or Ctrl-iNs, without corresponding changes at the RNA or protein level. An exception was MXRA8, previously described in glial cells as a mediator of blood-brain barrier integrity and astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. This protein showed increased protein abundance despite the absence of phosphorylation in HD-iNs, suggesting a compensatory mechanism - a pattern also observed in human post mortem cortical HD tissue. Additionally, MXRA8 showed altered protein-protein interactions with lysosomal and metabolic regulators in HD-iNs, highlighting its potential role in autophagy impairment as well as in neurovascular dysfunction. These findings uncover a distinct layer of post-translational dysregulation in HD, suggesting that phospho-switch proteins such as MXRA8 may be candidate effectors of pathology and thus site-specific phosphorylation loss may contribute to impaired signaling and proteostasis in human HD neurons.",

    "title": "Non-redundant role of the a3 isoform of Na,K-ATPase in neuronal excitability and spiking dynamics",
    "content": "The Na,K-ATPase (NKA) plays a fundamental role in neuronal excitability by maintaining ionic gradients and contributing to electrogenic resting currents. Among its isoforms, the neuron-specific a3 subunit exhibits a uniquely low affinity for intracellular Na, weak voltage dependence, and slightly reduced ATP sensitivity compared to the ubiquitous a1. Although mutations in ATP1A3 are known to cause severe neurological disorders, the specific kinetic features of a3 that underlie its functional specialization remain incompletely understood. Here we employed biophysically detailed models of stretch receptor neurons, grounded in patch-clamp recordings of the a3-isoform current and spiking responses, to dissect the contribution of isoform-specific pump kinetics to firing behavior. Substitution of a1 for a3 abolished the ability to sustain long spike trains and reduced high-frequency entrainment, whereas a3-preserved prolonged discharges and faithful responses to vibratory stimuli. Remarkably, even halved pump density a3 50% preserved superior excitability compared to mixed expression (a 50%/a1 50%), indicating that kinetic profile rather than pump quantity determines firing capacity. Hybrid models revealed that Na; affinity is the decisive factor: retaining the low Na; affinity of a3 preserved excitability, while introducing a1-like voltage or ATP dependence produced only minor effect on simulated neuron discharge. These findings establish a mechanistic explanation for the selective expression of a3 in muscle spindle afferents and other neurons with high-frequency demands, and help to explain why a1 cannot compensate in ATP1A3-linked diseases. More broadly, they highlight the principle that isoform specialization of the NKA is not redundant but tuned to the discharge requirements of distinct neuronal populations.",

    "title": "Dual Inhibitors Targeting G9a and GSK-3B: Translational Perspectives on Alzheimer's Disease Treatment",
    "content": "Epigenetic dysregulation and abnormal kinase signaling are key factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet no existing treatment targets both. We introduce a dual-targeting strategy that inhibits the histone methyltransferase G9a and the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3B;-two synergistic drivers of neurodegeneration-using a single CNS-penetrant small molecule. This report covers the rational design, synthesis, and preclinical testing of T2 as a new therapeutic candidate. Structure-based pharmacophore modeling and medicinal chemistry refinement led to a focused library of dual inhibitors, with T2 standing out due to its balanced potency against both targets, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, low off-target effects, and a favorable safety profile. In the SAMP8 mouse model of late-onset AD, T2 markedly improved memory, restored social behaviors, and increased synaptic complexity. Molecular studies showed that T2 treatment lowered tau phosphorylation, the AB;42/40 ratio, and neurofilament light chain levels, while boosting neurotrophic factors and anti-inflammatory pathways. Multi-omics analyses indicated that T2 causes widespread transcriptional and proteomic changes, activating synaptic plasticity genes (like Arc and Nectin3), reducing ferroptosis and senescence-related pathways, and altering chromatin accessibility. Electrophysiological tests confirmed the restoration of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Overall, these results support dual G9a/GSK-3B; inhibition as a promising disease-modifying approach for AD, with T2 emerging as a strong candidate for further therapeutic development.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares. The results and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Increased ambient temperature mitigates pathology in the Ndufs4-/- mouse model of Leigh Syndrome",
    "content": "Leigh syndrome (LS) is a devastating mitochondrial disease (MD) for which there is no treatment. Together with Leigh-like syndrome (LLS), LS constitutes part of the Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) disorders, which are the most frequent manifestation of a primary mitochondrial disease (MD) in children. Ndufs4-/- mice are a widely used animal model to study LS pathophysiology and interventions. These mice display an isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency and a brain-specific pathomechanism. Similar to other mouse models of human disease, Ndufs4-/- mice are routinely housed and studied at a subthermoneutral ambient temperature. This means that these mice experience chronic cold-stress, which potentially aggravates disease symptoms and reduces their translational value. Here, we provide evidence that housing Ndufs4-/- mice at 26 oC instead of 20 oC increases their skin, core and brain temperature. At this higher temperature, Ndufs4-/- mice displayed lower energy expenditure and, importantly, a longer lifespan, pathology reversal in specific brain regions, as well as increased voluntary locomotor activity. We conclude that ambient temperature is a previously overlooked but highly relevant disease modifier in Ndufs4-/- mice. Given the reduced mitochondrial energy production and aberrant thermoregulation in LSS and other MD patients, our findings suggest that reducing energy requirements might be of therapeutic value and/or contribute to an improved quality of life in these patients. In a broader sense, our results advocate the use of (more) thermoneutral housing to evaluate pathomechanisms and intervention strategies in murine models of human disease.",

    "title": "Diazepam alters the shape of alpha oscillations recorded from human cortex using EEG",
    "content": "While neural oscillations are conventionally assessed via their frequency, power and phase, developing literature suggests that their shape also provides neurophysiological and functional information. However, the extent to which the shape of oscillations recorded non-invasively in humans index specific brain processes remains unclear. This study implemented a pharmaco-EEG approach to begin addressing this limitation. In 21 healthy adults, resting-state EEG data was collected before and after placebo or diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of type A {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. The shape of individual cycles in the alpha band was then derived using empirical mode decomposition, followed by extraction of principal components (PCs) describing specific facets of alpha shape. Results of this approach show that all shape features were unchanged following placebo. In contrast, diazepam was associated with complex changes in several shape features, including peak-trough shape and edge speed. While changes in shape were apparent in all cortical lobes, the strongest alterations were specific to sensorimotor and parietal cortices. Taken together, our results support the neurophysiological utility of waveform shape, particularly with respect to non-invasive human recordings. Furthermore, the regional specificity of effects highlights the need for more granular exploration of waveform diversity.",

    "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

The trajectory of linguistic growth of young Indians is invariably multilingual and multidialectal and involves at least one L1, followed most often by Hindi and English or other languages. We carried out a qualitative study with over over a thousand students entering university using a modified LEAP questionnaire for self-assessment of fluency, literacy, domain of use, and time course of language acquisition and loss. We explore the interaction between heritage language, multilingualism, and the formal (trilingual) education policy and show that they intersect to redraw the linguistic profiles of individuals with shifting language dominance, and impact linguistic ability, especially in L1.

    "content": "Objective. Neural encoding of visual stimuli aims to predict brain responses in the visual cortex to different external inputs. Deep neural networks trained on relatively simple tasks such as image classification have been widely applied in neural encoding studies of early visual areas. However, due to the complex and abstract nature of semantic representations in high-level visual cortices, their encoding performance and interpretability remain limited. Approach. We propose a novel neural encoding model guided by the image captioning task. During image captioning, an attention module is employed to focus on key visual objects. In the neural encoding stage, a flexible receptive field (RF) module is designed to simulate voxel-level visual fields. To bridge the domain gap between these two processes, we introduce the Atten-RF module, which effectively aligns attention-guided visual representations with voxel-wise brain activity patterns. Main results. Experiments on the large-scale natural scenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior average encoding performance across seven high-level visual cortices, with a mean squared error of 0.765, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.443, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.245. Significance. By leveraging the guidance and alignment provided by a complex vision-language task, our model enhances the prediction of voxel activity in high-level visual cortex, offering a new perspective on the neural encoding problem. Furthermore, various visualization techniques provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual information processing.",

    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "title": "When the unconscious contents are expressed in both Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS) and dreams: An experimental study.",
    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "title": "Ignorance is bliss: A meta-analysis of the fear-reducing effects of very brief exposure.",
    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Objective. Analysis tools for peripheral nerve recordings remain underdeveloped compared to those for brain signals, limiting the advancement of nerve neurotechnologies for clinical treatments such as closed-loop systems. This study introduces and explores the performance of two novel nerve signal analysis techniques\u2014cross-correlation analysis and spike delay velocity analysis\u2014which rely on a defining feature of peripheral nerve signals: the reliable conduction velocity of signals transmitted by axons in nerves. Approach. We test the capabilities of the introduced cross-correlation and spike delay velocity analysis techniques both in silico on synthetic nerve signals and on in vivo nerve signals acquired from freely-moving rats. Main results. Our findings show that both techniques can be successfully employed to extract transmission direction and velocity information from compact two-electrode site peripheral nerve recording designs. Notably, cross-correlation analysis can be employed to detect neural signals of very low signal-to-noise ratio, otherwise undetectable by typical spike detection approaches. Significance. Our findings provide new techniques to both enhance detection and extract new information in the form of velocity data from nerve recordings using a compact two-electrode site recording setup. Unlike traditional methods, this design eliminates the need for long electrode arrays, making it particularly well-suited for use in freely-moving animal models and translational applications. As axon signal conduction direction and velocity are tightly linked to neural function, these techniques can support new research into peripheral nervous system function and new therapeutic approaches driven by neural interfaces.",

    "content": "There are different perspectives on the psychological constructs of resilience and hypnotizability, and both are related to aspects of mental health. Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

However, research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy of acceptance, which may be related to instructions to accept different aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., thoughts vs. emotion). We compared the effects of self-regulation instructions to accept thoughts, emotions, or a combination of both on measures of affect (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, state anxiety) and emotional dysregulation immediately following emotion-eliciting film clips and following recovery periods after film clips. We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip.

    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "An Emergentist Account of Language in the Brain\u2014Seeking Neural Synergies Behind Human Uniqueness",
    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

    "title": "Impact of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation on Event-related Potentials during a Response Inhibition Task",
    "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "title": "BGTransform: a neurophysiologically informed EEG data augmentation framework",
    "content": "Objective. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for decoding electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) signals. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity and variability of available training data. Existing data augmentation methods often introduce signal distortions or lack physiological validity. This study proposes a novel augmentation strategy designed to improve generalization while preserving the underlying neurophysiological structure of EEG signals. Approach. We propose Background EEG Transform (BGTransform), a principled data augmentation framework that leverages the neurophysiological dissociation between task-related activity and ongoing background EEG. In contrast to existing methods, BGTransform generates new trials by selectively perturbing the background EEG component while preserving the task-related signal, thus enabling controlled variability without compromising class-discriminative features. We applied BGTransform to three publicly available EEG-BCI datasets spanning steady-state visual evoked potential and P300 paradigms. The effectiveness of BGTransform is evaluated using several widely adopted neural decoding models under three training regimes: (1) without augmentation (baseline model), (2) with conventional augmentation methods, and (3) with BGTransform. Main results. Across all datasets and model architectures, BGTransform consistently outperformed both baseline models and conventional augmentation techniques. Compared to models trained without BGTransform, it achieved average classification accuracy improvements of 2.45%\u201315.52%, 4.36%\u201317.15% and 7.55%\u201310.47% across the three datasets, respectively. In addition, BGTransform demonstrated greater robustness across subjects and tasks, maintaining stable performance under varying recording conditions. Significance. BGTransform provides a principled and effective approach to augmenting EEG data, informed by neurophysiological insight. By preserving task-related components and introducing controlled variability, the method addresses the challenge of data sparsity in EEG-BCI training. These findings support the utility of BGTransform for improving the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of deep learning models in neural engineering applications.",

    "title": "Using economic value signals from primate prefrontal cortex in neuro-engineering applications",
    "content": "Objective. Brain\u2013machine interface (BMI) research has shown the efficacy of using motor and sensory-related neural signals to assist physically impaired patients. Despite the comparable ability to extract more abstract cognitive signals from the brain, little effort has been devoted to leveraging these signals in neuro-engineering applications. In this study, we explore the use of neural signals related to economic value, a key cognitive construct, in a BMI context. Approach. Using multivariate time series data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices in a value-based decision-making task. We implement a reinforcement learning-based training approach to develop adaptive decoders that can be extended to handle multi-step decisions, which frequently arise in real-world settings. Main results. We develop neural decoders leveraging subjective value signals to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices with accuracy on average, with above-chance accuracy even when choice options are objectively equal. We show that this same decoder architecture can be trained to execute choice-related actions and execute action sequences aligned with the user\u2019s goal. Finally, we explore a decoder architecture that uses a neural forecasting model equipped with task-related information, and show that it makes high accuracy predictions \u2009ms sooner than would otherwise be possible. Significance. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuro-engineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals to aid users in goal-directed behavior. They suggest that using abstract cognitive signals in real-world settings may be more accurate when combined with information from multiple sources, such as motor and sensory regions. This research also highlights the potential need for systems to measure their confidence in their actions when user input is minimal.",

    "content": "Objective. New implantable and wearable devices hold great promise to help patients manage their seizure disorders. One proposed application is measuring the rate of interictal epileptiform discharges as a biomarker of medication levels and seizure risk. This study aims to determine whether interictal epileptiform spike rates (spikes) are independently associated with anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels and evaluate whether spike rates are a reliable biomarker for ASM levels. Approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 69 patients with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring during ASM taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit. An automated spike detection algorithm, validated seizure annotations, and a model of ASM load were used to assess the relationship between spike rates, ASM level, state of consciousness, and seizure timing using linear mixed effects models. Event related analysis and seasonal autoregressive models were applied to evaluate both short-term and longer-term effects of ASMs on spike rates, respectively. Main Results. Spike rates were found to increase following seizures, during sleep, and in patients experiencing early seizures, with no significant association between ASM load and spike rates after controlling for these confounders. Initial models without controls showed a positive association between ASM load and spike rates. However, this relationship disappeared when the effects of sleep and seizures were accounted for. Medication-specific analysis revealed that only levetiracetam showed a significant impact on spike rates during taper. Significance. This study demonstrates that interictal spike rates are more strongly influenced by seizure activity and sleep than by ASM levels, suggesting limited utility of spike rates as a biomarker for ASM load. However, spikes may still serve as important markers for seizure control and disease severity.",

    "title": "Neuralace: manufacture, parylene-C coating, and mechanical properties",
    "content": "Objective. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type subdural electrode array, to characterize its mechanical compatibility with neural tissue (i.e., the forces exerted onto the brain upon conformation) for chronic brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A full-factorial design of experiments was used to assess the effects of geometrical variations, orientation, and polymeric encapsulation on the stiffness of silicon-based Neuralace structures. A custom low-force four-point bending setup was developed to measure flexural stiffness in a physiologically relevant displacement range. Main results. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N m\u22121 to 7.21 N m\u22121, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, orientation, and parylene-C (PPXC) encapsulation. Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10\u2013100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the brain\u2019s topology (considering a 60 mm radius of the gyrus). Significance. Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. These arrays are now transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs, which requires consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study establishes a rigorous and reproducible framework for mechanical characterization of conformable neural implants and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning design parameters to reduce implant-induced mechanical stress on cortical tissue. The results support future development of chronic BCI-compatible subdural electrodes with improved biocompatibility through mechanical design.",

Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

    "title": "Stress drives the hippocampus to prioritize statistical prediction over episodic encoding",
    "content": "The hippocampus plays a critical role in encoding individual experiences into episodic memory, while also detecting patterns shared across these experiences that allow us to anticipate future events via statistical learning. Acute stress is known to impact the hippocampus but may have opposite effects on these competing functions. That is, although stress impairs episodic encoding, it may instead enhance statistical learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how stress influences the hippocampal pathways and subfields that support episodic encoding and statistical learning while participants performed a task that engaged both processes. Across several analyses, stress biased hippocampal processing in favour of statistical learning, suppressing pattern separation between events in the dentate gyrus and enhancing the representation of statistically predictive features. Furthermore, stress drove the hippocampal monosynaptic pathway to support statistical learning rather than episodic encoding during predictive situations. Together, these data suggest that acute stress elicits targeted, adaptive changes in hippocampal pathways which may facilitate predicting and responding to upcoming events.",

    "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
    "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

    "title": "Mediodorsal Thalamic Input to Striatum Contributes to Early Action Learning",
    "content": "<p>Action control is hypothesized to be mediated by corticothalamo-basal ganglia loops subserving the acquisition and updating of action contingencies. Within this, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is thought to contribute to volitional control over behavior largely through its interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, MD also projects into striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the contribution of such projections to behavioral control is not known. Using a mouse model of volitional action control in either sex, here we find that MD terminal calcium activity in dorsal medial striatum (MD-&gt;DMS) represents action information during initial acquisition of a novel action contingency. This representation of action information decreases with continued experience. Data demonstrate MD-&gt;DMS activity is necessary to learn and employ a contingency control over actions. Functional attenuation of MD-&gt;DMS activity negated normal exploration, instead biasing repetitive action control, and resulted in mice unable to adapt their initial action strategy upon changes in action contingency. This suggests MD supports plasticity underlying initial action strategy learning used to adjust control given changing contingencies. Overall, these data show that MD projections into striatum contribute to volitional action control that supports acquisition of adaptive behavior.</p>",

    "content": "<p>At the glutamatergic synapses between rod photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (BCs), neurotransmitter is detected by the postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6. This receptor forms trans-synaptic interactions with ELFN1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule expressed in rods, and ELFN1 is important for mGluR6 localization at BC dendritic tips. Here, we show that in mice of either sex lacking mGluR6, the presynaptic localization of ELFN1 is disrupted. In rods of mGluR6 null mice, ELFN1 is still restricted to the axon terminal spherules but is only partially colocalized with synapses. The ELFN1 localization defect is rescued by expressing mGluR6-EGFP in ON-BCs. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and LRR C-terminal cap (LRRCT) regions of the ELFN1 extracellular domain (ECD) are necessary and sufficient for binding to all of the Group 3 mGluRs, including mGluR6. ELFN1-flag expressed in rods of wild-type mice is correctly localized at presynapses, colocalizing with the postsynaptic marker TRPM1 in the outer plexiform layer. Deletion of the LRRCT domain abolished trafficking of ELFN1-flag to rod spherules, whereas deletion of other parts of the ELFN1 ECD did not prevent axonal trafficking or correct presynaptic localization. Our results demonstrate bidirectional mutual regulation of presynaptic enrichment of ELFN1 and postsynaptic enrichment of mGluR6 at photoreceptor synapses.</p>",

    "title": "Convergence and Segregation of Excitatory and Inhibitory Afferents in the Paraventricular Thalamic Nucleus",
    "content": "<p>The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) integrates subcortical signals related to arousal, stress, addiction, and anxiety with top-down cortical influences. Increases or decreases in PVT activity exert profound, long-lasting effects on behavior related to motivation, addiction, and homeostasis. Yet the sources of its subcortical excitatory and inhibitory afferents, their distribution within the PVT, and their integration with layer-specific cortical inputs remain unclear. Using transgenic male and female mice selective for GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, or for different cortical layers, we found that the input organization of PVT is unique among thalamic nuclei. PVT received subcortical GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs from multiple, distinct hypothalamic and brainstem regions. Most regions provided either excitatory or inhibitory afferents; however, subcortical inputs with dual components have also been found. Most of these subcortical inputs selectively targeted the core region of the PVT that contained large number of densely packed calretinin-positive (CR+) neurons. Cortical afferents to PVT displayed layer-specific segregation. Layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex preferentially innervated the CR+ core, whereas layer 6 input was more abundant in the transition zone between PVT and the mediodorsal nucleus. These findings demonstrate extensive convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from diverse subcortical sources, selectively, in a sharply delineated CR+ core region of PVT which is also under strong top-down control from layer 5. This unique organization may explain why the CR+ PVT core serves as a critical bottleneck in the subcortex&ndash;cortex communication involved in affective behavior.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Following injury, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) exhibits remarkable regenerative capacity, whereas the central nervous system (CNS) has limited regenerative potential. This difference is partially attributed to distinct postinjury myelin breakdown. However, the underlying mechanisms driving this disparity remain unclear. By comparing the expression profiles of injured peripheral and central nerves in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice, we identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) as a key regulator that determines the differences in myelin breakdown between the injured PNS and CNS. Schwann cell-derived IGFBP2 in the injured PNS promotes myelin breakdown and facilitates axonal regeneration. Furthermore, through lipidomics, we identify ceramide, a sphingolipid regulated by ceramide synthase 6 in injured nerves, as playing a critical role in IGFBP2-mediated myelin breakdown. Conversely, minimal IGFBP2 expression is observed in the injured CNS, contributing to the limited myelin breakdown and axon regeneration in injured CNS. These findings provide insights into the divergent regenerative potential of the PNS and CNS and unveil IGFBP2 and ceramide as promising targets for promoting CNS regeneration after injury.</p>",

    "title": "Smg5 Enhances Oligodendrocyte Differentiation via Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay of Hnrnpl Variant Transcripts",
    "content": "<p>Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination codons (PTCs) and fine-tunes gene expression by targeting RNA transcripts with other NMD inducing features. This study demonstrates that conditional knock-out of <i>Smg5</i>, a key NMD component, in oligodendrocyte lineage cells disrupts the degradation of PTC-containing transcripts, including aberrant variants of the RNA-binding protein <i>Hnrnpl</i>. The loss of SMG5 in both sexes of mice impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation, reduced myelin gene expression, and led to thinner myelin sheaths and compromised motor function in mice. Mechanistically, HNRNPL was shown to regulate the alternative splicing of myelin-associated genes <i>Mag</i> and <i>Nfasc</i> and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. These findings reveal that SMG5-mediated NMD ensures RNA processing fidelity essential for proper oligodendrocyte development and CNS myelination.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are complex phenomena governed by genetics, neurophysiology, environment, and societal structures. New methods to understand the underlying neurogenetics are valuable for designing personalized interventional strategies. Here, we used a two-choice self-administration zebrafish assay to isolate the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha3 (<i>chrna3</i>) in alcohol response. Juvenile zebrafish, of either sex, prior to complete sex differentiation, were examined in this study. They exhibited a biphasic response when self-administering alcohol that transitioned from attraction to aversion within minutes, suggesting they can regulate exposure to alcohol. This inverted U-shaped self-administration mirrored the effect alcohol has on shoaling behavior. Exposure to low concentration of alcohol reduced anxiety-like behaviors, while sedative effects became prominent at higher concentrations resulting in reduced locomotion and uncoordinated swimming. In contrast, these responses are blunted in <i>chrna3</i> mutants. They exhibited prolonged alcohol self-administration and increased gregariousness. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission alongside cholinergic signaling is impacted in the mutant brains. Our results thus suggest that <i>chrna3</i> dysfunction has a systemic change with an increase in alcohol tolerance being one effect. These findings also highlight the use of nonrodent alternatives to understand the neurogenetics of development of AUD.</p>",

    "title": "Involvement of the Endothelial N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor on Vessel-Associated Positioning and Differentiation of Cortical Oligodendrocytes and on Motor Activity",
    "content": "<p>During cortical development, oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) attachment and detachment to microvessels play a crucial role in their positioning and differentiation. In the developing brain, endothelial cells are regionally diverse, and previous studies showed a peak in cortical endothelial NMDA receptor (eNMDAR) expression during perinatal life, coinciding with OPC migration along microvessels. This raises the hypothesis that eNMDAR might influence the fate of vessel-associated OPC. In this study, a Grin1<sup>lox/lox</sup>/VeCad<sup>Cre</sup> mouse model was used to investigate in females and males the effects of endothelial GluN1 invalidation (eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) on (1) positioning and differentiation of cortical oligodendrocytes and myelination, (2) OPC/microvessel association and endothelial MMP9-like activity, and (3) motor activity. Results showed that, from postnatal days (P) 2 to P15, PDGFR&alpha; expression was increased in eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice and returned to wild-type levels by P45. CNPase and MBP expression was reduced at P15 and remained low in adult eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Histological analysis revealed no change in OPC&ndash;microvessel association, but positioning was altered with increased density in layers VI and V at P15. Myelination was impaired, as evidenced by thinner corpus callosum, reduced myelin sheath thickness, and higher g-ratio. Axonal mitochondria density was significantly increased. Functional tests revealed that glutamate could not stimulate endothelial MMP9-like activity in eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Molecular, histological and functional changes were linked to sensorimotor disabilities. At P45, despite the absence of observable myelination defects, locomotor impairments persisted, suggesting that early OPC differentiation disruption contributes to lasting motor dysfunction. These findings offer new insights into OPC vulnerability in human preterm infants.</p>",

    "title": "Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Signaling through Mu&#x0308;ller Glia Regulates Neuroprotection, Accumulation of Immune Cells, and Neuronal Regeneration in the Rodent Retina",
    "content": "<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate how Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates glial phenotype, neuroprotection, and reprogramming of Mu&#x0308;ller glia (MG) into neurogenic MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the adult male and female mouse retina. We found that S1P-related genes were dynamically regulated following retinal damage. <i>S1pr1</i> (S1P receptor 1) and <i>Sphk1</i> (sphingosine kinase 1) are expressed at low levels by resting MG and are rapidly upregulated following acute damage. Overexpression of the neurogenic bHLH transcription factor Ascl1 in MG downregulates <i>S1pr1</i>, and inhibition of Sphk1 and S1pr1/3 enhances Ascl1-driven differentiation of bipolar-like cells. Treatments that activate S1pr1 or increase retinal levels of S1P initiate proinflammatory NFB signaling in MG, whereas treatments that inhibit S1pr1 or decreased levels of S1P suppress NFB signaling in MG. Conditional knock-out (cKO) of <i>S1pr1</i> in MG, but not <i>Sphk1</i>, enhances the accumulation of immune cells in damaged retinas. cKO of <i>S1pr1</i> promotes the survival of ganglion cells, whereas cKO of <i>Sphk1</i> promotes the survival amacrine cells in damaged retinas. Consistent with these findings, pharmacological treatments that inhibit S1P receptors or inhibit Sphk1 have protective effects upon inner retinal neurons. We conclude that the S1P signaling pathway is activated in MG after damage and this pathway restricts the accumulation of immune cells, impairs neuron survival, and suppresses the reprogramming of MG into neurogenic progenitors in the adult mouse retina.</p>",

    "title": "A Neural Signature of the Bias Toward Self-Focus",
    "content": "<p>People are remarkably self-focused, disproportionately choosing to think about themselves relative to other topics. Self-focus can be adaptive, helping individuals fulfill their needs. It can also be maladaptive, with self-focus a risk and maintenance factor for internalizing disorders like depression. Yet, the drive to focus on the self remains to be fully characterized. We discovered a brain pattern that when spontaneously brought online during a quick mental break predicts the desire to focus on oneself just a few seconds later. In Study 1 (19 female and 13 male human subjects), we identified a default network neural signature from pr-trial activity that predicts multiple indicators of self-focus within our sample. In Study 2 (588 female and 498 male human subjects), we applied our neural signature to independent resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project. We found that individuals who score high on internalizing, a form of maladaptive self-focus, similarly move in and out of this pattern during rest, suggesting a systematic trajectory toward self-focused thought. This is the first work to \"decode\" the bias to focus on the self and paves the way toward stopping maladaptive self-focus in its course.</p>",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

Current methods for enhancing sensitivity still face the challenges of complex preparation processes and the dependence on low-temperature environments. This work demonstrates that constructing a discrete, donor (D)-acceptor (A) structure and employing the photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) technique may simultaneously reduce dark current and increase photocurrent efficiently, thereby...",

    "content": "In the oral cavity, oral stereognosis and chemesthesis refer to the abilities to recognize shapes and detect noxious substances, respectively, through various receptors distributed on the tongue. The absence of standardized methods to assess oral somatosensory perception has led to a lack of consensus regarding the relationship between taste and trigeminal sensations. While some studies reported lower trigeminal perception in taste disorders, others did not confirm this correlation. To analyze...",

For teleoperation systems to replicate these real-life interactions, tactile sensation must be presented and distributed across the entire fingertip. Thus, understanding the distribution of tactile acuity at the fingertip is imperative. Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",
