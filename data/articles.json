To date, the performance of the trim and fill\nmethod has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more\ncomprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in\na number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those\nfrom usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely\nuse of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in\nthe meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the\nperformance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study\nheterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive\neffect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is\npresent the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than\nthe usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate\nfrom the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the\npresence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our\nsimulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the\npresence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce\nthe bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not\nideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly\ncaused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the\nperformance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various\nmeta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form\nof sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.2889&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n17476644&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;4544-4562&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Performance\nof the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and\nbetween-study\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Peters&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jaime\nL.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Sutton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Alex\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;David\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Abrams&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Keith\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Rushton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lesley&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2007&quot;,11,10]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/DMQP989N&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;It\nis known that the existence of publication bias can influence the conclusions\nof a meta-analysis. Some methods have been developed to deal with publication\nbias, but issues remain. One particular method called 'trim and fill' is\ndesigned to adjust for publication bias. The method, which is intuitively\nappealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a simple and\npopular graphical tool called the funnel plot. We present a simulation study\ndesigned to evaluate the behaviour of this method. Our results indicate that\nwhen the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they estimate different\neffects), trim and fill may inappropriately adjust for publication bias where\nnone exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously adjust for non-existent\nbias if (i) the variability among studies causes some precisely estimated\nstudies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii) an inverse\nrelationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is introduced by the\nstudies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest that the funnel plot\nitself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses. Selection modelling is\nan alternative method warranting further study. It performed better than trim\nand fill in our simulations, although its frequency of convergence varied,\ndepending on the simulation parameters.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.1461&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n12820277&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;2113-2126&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Adjusting\nfor publication bias in the presence of\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Terrin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Norma&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schmid&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Christopher\nH.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lau&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joseph&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Olkin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ingram&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2003&quot;,7,15]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Peters\net al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

Specifying a\nrange of values around zero allows researchers to statistically reject the\npresence of effects large enough to matter, and prevents practically\ninsignificant effects from being interpreted as a statistically significant\ndifference. We compare the behavior of the recently proposed second generation\np-value (Blume, D\u2019Agostino McGowan, Dupont, &amp; Greevy, 2018) with the more\nestablished Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) equivalence testing procedure\n(Schuirmann, 1987). We show that the two approaches yield almost identical\nresults under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g., when the\nconfidence interval is wider than the equivalence range, or when confidence\nintervals are asymmetric) the second generation p-value becomes difficult to\ninterpret. The second generation p-value is interpretable in a dichotomous\nmanner (i.e., when the SGPV equals 0 or 1 because the confidence intervals lies\ncompletely within or outside of the equivalence range), but this dichotomous\ninterpretation does not require calculations. We conclude that equivalence\ntests yield more consistent p-values, distinguish between datasets that yield\nthe same second generation p-value, and allow for easier control of Type I and\nType II error rates.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.933&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Daniel Lakens, Marie Delacre&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;1-11&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Equivalence\nTesting and the Second Generation\nP-Value&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Delacre&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marie&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,7,13]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lakens\n&amp; Delacre, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

In\nthis article we assume that the overall goal researchers wish to achieve is to\nmaximize the utility gained by conducting the replication study. We then\npropose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the\nreplication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The\nreplication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we\ncould gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a)\nthe value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim\nbased on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal\ndecision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph\nmodeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of\nexpected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative\nestimates of replication value.

Replicating\nresearchers will therefore often have to decide which of several relevant\ncandidates to target for replication. Formal strategies for efficient study\nselection have been proposed, but none have been explored for practical\nfeasibility \u2013 a prerequisite for validation. Here we move one step closer to\nefficient replication study selection by exploring the feasibility of a\nparticular selection strategy that estimates replication value as a function of\ncitation impact and sample size (Isager, van 't Veer, &amp; Lakens, 2021). We\ntested our strategy on a sample of fMRI studies in social neuroscience. We\nfirst report our efforts to generate a representative candidate set of\nreplication targets. We then explore the feasibility and reliability of\nestimating replication value for the targets in our set, resulting in a dataset\nof 1358 studies ranked on their value of prioritising them for replication.

Here,\nwe present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of\nthe most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might\nrealistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several\nlevels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity,\nand used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature.

We give exact theoretical results showing\nhow selection for significance affects the distribution of statistical power in\na heterogeneous population of significance tests. In a set of large-scale\nsimulation studies, we compare four methods for estimating population mean\npower of a set of studies selected for significance (a maximum likelihood\nmodel, extensions of p-curve and p-uniform, &amp;amp; z-curve). The p-uniform\nand p-curve methods performed well with a fixed effects size and varying sample\nsizes. However, when there was substantial variability in effect sizes as well\nas sample sizes, both methods systematically overestimate mean power. With\nheterogeneity in effect sizes, the maximum likelihood model produced the most\naccurate estimates when the distribution of effect sizes matched the\nassumptions of the model, but z-curve produced more accurate estimates when the\nassumptions of the maximum likelihood model were not met. We recommend the use\nof z-curve to estimate the typical power of significant results, which has\nimplications for the replicability of significant results in psychology\njournals.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.874&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Jerry Brunner, Ulrich\nSchimmack&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Estimating\nPopulation Mean Power Under Conditions of Heterogeneity and Selection for\nSignificance&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/874&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Brunner&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jerry&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schimmack&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ulrich&quot;}],&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2022&quot;,3,16]]},&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,5,31]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Brunner\n&amp; Schimmack, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">It seems a\nbit of a stretch to say the p-curve method did not get scrutiny appropriate to\nits popularity when there were many papers that criticized it, relatively\nquickly </span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:\nEN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span>ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION\n{&quot;citationID&quot;:&quot;LqMzfpTk&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;formattedCitation&quot;:&quot;(Aert\net al., 2016; Bishop &amp; Thompson, 2016; Ulrich &amp; Miller, 2018)&quot;,&quot;plainCitation&quot;:&quot;(Aert\net al., 2016; Bishop &amp; Thompson, 2016; Ulrich &amp; Miller,\n2018)&quot;,&quot;noteIndex&quot;:0},&quot;citationItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1415,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/B8XNF95F&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:1415,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Because\nof overwhelming evidence of publication bias in psychology, techniques to\ncorrect meta-analytic estimates for such bias are greatly needed.

The properties of\np-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of\nthese simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be\nused as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a\ncertain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually\ndemonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous\nmathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined\nwithout simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any\nstatistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough\nevaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions\np-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition,\nwe used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of\npublication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence\nthe shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than\n1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also\nsuggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an\narticle as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level.\nThis gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of\nreal effects even when no such effects are actually present.

What is fair to say is that\nstatisticians failed to engage with an incredibly important topic (test for\npublication bias) that addressed a clear need in many scientific communities,\nas most of the criticism was by psychological methodologists. I fully agree\nthat statisticians should have engaged more with this technique. I believe the\nreason that they didn\u2019t is because there is a real problem in the reward\nstructure in statistics, where statisticians get greater rewards inside their\nfield by proposing a 12<sup>th</sup> approach to compute confidence intervals\naround a non-parametric effect size estimate for a test that no one uses, than\nto help psychologists solve a problem they really need a solution for. Indeed,\nfor a statistician, publication bias is a very messy business, and there will\nnever be a sufficiently rigorous test for publication bias to get credit from\nfellow statisticians. There are no beautiful mathematical solutions, no\ncreative insights, there is only the messy reality of a literature that is\nbiased by human actions that we can never adequately capture in a model. The\nfact that empirical researchers often don\u2019t know where to begin to evaluate the\nreliability of claims in their publication-bias-ridden field is not something\nstatisticians care about.

Journal peer review will not\nsuffice, because it is only as good as the two or three peers that happen to be\nwilling and available to review a paper. But it is a start. We should enable\nresearchers to see how well papers are peer reviewed by journals. Without\ntransparency, we can\u2019t calibrate our trust </span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span>ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION\n{&quot;citationID&quot;:&quot;DuUONcRk&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;formattedCitation&quot;:&quot;(Vazire,\n2017)&quot;,&quot;plainCitation&quot;:&quot;(Vazire, 2017)&quot;,&quot;noteIndex&quot;:0},&quot;citationItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:2227,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/6IRLDTML&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:2227,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Article:\nQuality Uncertainty Erodes Trust in\nScience&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Collabra:\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1525/collabra.74&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2474-7394&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Authors\nwho publish with this journal agree to the following terms:<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>Authors retain copyright and grant the\njournal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under\na<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>Creative Commons Attribution\nLicense<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>that allows others to share the\nwork with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in\nthis journal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>Authors are able to enter\ninto separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive\ndistribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to\nan institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement\nof its initial publication in this journal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0\n</span>Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in\ninstitutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the\nsubmission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier\nand greater citation of published work (See<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0\n</span>The Effect of Open Access ).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>All\nthird-party images reproduced on this journal are shared under Educational Fair\nUse.

Peer reviews should be open, for\nall papers, including papers proposing new statistical methods.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">If we want\nour statistical methods to be of high quality, we need to specify quality\nstandards. Morey and Davis-Stober point out the limitations of simulation-based\ntests of a method and convincingly argue for the value of evaluating the\nmathematical properties of a testing procedure. If as a field we agree that an\nevaluation of the mathematical properties of a test is desirable, we should\ntrack whether this evaluation has been performed, or not. We could have a long\nchecklist of desirable quality control standards \u2013 e.g., a method has been\ntested on real datasets, it has been compared to similar methods, those\ncomparisons have been performed objectively based on a well-justified set of\ncriteria, etc. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One could\ncreate a database where for each method the quality standards that have been\nmet and that have not been met are listed. If considered useful, the database\ncould also track how often a method is used, by tracking citations, and listing\npapers that have implemented the method (as opposed to those merely discussing\nthe method). When statistical methods become widely used, the database would point\nresearchers to which methods deserve more scrutiny. The case of magnitude-based\ninference in sport science reveals the importance of a public call for scrutiny\nwhen a method becomes widely popular, especially when this popularity is\nlimited to a single field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The more\ncomplex methods are, the more limitations they have. This will be true for all\nmethods that aim to deal with publication bias, because the way scientists bias\nthe literature is difficult to quantify. Maybe as a field we will come to agree\nthat tests for bias are never accurate enough, and we will recommend people to\njust look at the distribution of p-values without performing a test. Alternatively,\nwe might believe that it is useful to have a testing procedure that too often\nsuggests a literature contains at least some non-zero effects, because we feel\nwe need some way to intersubjectively point out that there is bias in a\nliterature, even if this is based on an imperfect test. Such discussions\nrequire a wide range of stakeholders, and the opinion of statisticians about\nthe statistical properties of a test is only one source of input in this\ndiscussion. Imperfect procedures are implemented all the time, if they are the\nbest we have, and doing nothing is also not working. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Statistical\nmethods are rarely perfect from their inception, and all have limitations. Although\nI understand the feeling, banning all tests that have not been adequately vetted\nby an expert is inherently unscientific. Such a suggestion would destroy the\nvery core of science \u2013 an institution that promotes mutual criticism, while\naccepting our fallibility.

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis.

    "title": "Highly Consistent Anatomical Asymmetry in a Small Primate Brain: Left is Always Larger in the Marmoset Monkey",
    "content": "Although lateralisation of brain function is relatively common in animals, this is rarely accompanied by overt anatomical asymmetries. In primates, morphological differences between the cerebral hemispheres are well established in Hominidae but have been regarded as subtler or inconsistent in other species. Here we demonstrate that the left hemisphere is reproducibly larger than the right hemisphere in one of the smallest primates, the marmoset. This asymmetry develops postnatally, persists throughout adult life, and is found in individuals from genetically isolated colonies. Voxel-based morphometry reveals that the larger left hemisphere is primarily due to differences in the volume of cortical areas linked to social cognition. This result challenges the notion that the development and evolution of marked morphological asymmetry between the hemispheres is linked to the evolution of large brains.",

Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "title": "Deep brain stimulation of nucleus basalis of meynert: Effect of stimulation mode and duration on learning in rat model of dementia.",
    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

As is usual in oddball paradigms, the P3b was much larger for trials in the rare category than for trials in the frequent category (see Figure 2).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1256\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/89260e9e-be6e-48b1-adc4-58b77a418deb/Figure_3.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1996\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 3</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">The main question was whether the location of the dot was encoded in working memory better for the oddball trials than for the standard trials. To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "Peri-operative pregabalin does not adversely impact experimentaloutcomes in rat models of chronic pain",
    "content": "Introduction: Multiple mechanisms contribute to the experience of pain where the use of model organisms to dissect mechanistically sensory regulatory circuitry is a vital component of discovering underlying causes of persistent pain in disease states. Such disease states can be modelled in animals using surgical procedures that, ethically, should involve administration of analgesia. However, since basic pain researchers often wish to measure pain-related events, animals may be denied peri-operative analgesia to avoid adversely influencing experimental outcomes. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peri-operative analgesia usage in rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) models. Using a combination of behavioural testing and in vivo electrophysiology in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, we assessed the impact of peri-operative pregabalin on nociceptive behaviours in the acute recovery phase, and behavioural and electrophysiological experimental outcomes in the chronic phase, of rat SNL and CIBP models. Results: A literature search revealed that, for studies using rat models of SNL or CIBP, only 5.37 % and 12.69 % respectively reported the use of peri-operative analgesia. We then demonstrated that the use of pregabalin as a peri-operative analgesic reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in the acute period following SNL surgery, with no impact on behavioural, electrophysiological or neuropharmacological outcomes in the chronic phase of either model. Conclusions: This study challenges the basic science researcher's reasoning that peri-operative analgesia confounds neurobiological outcomes. The use of peri-operative analgesia should be an important consideration to improve animal welfare in chronic models of pain.",

    "title": "Neuronal activity promotes repair by microglial reprogramming following demyelination",
    "content": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a multifaceted role in neurological disorders. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease, microglia contribute to inflammation and tissue damage, but can also support repair by clearing myelin debris, limiting inflammation and promoting remyelination and neuroprotection. The timely transition from their pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative states is essential for effective repair and, in chronic MS, persistent, defective microglial activation contributes to disease progression. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the microglial switch remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that neuronal activity can modulate microglial signature at the onset of remyelination in MS models, in a pattern-dependent manner. Transcriptomic analyses reveal a downregulation of pro-inflammatory, disease-associated microglial signatures alongside an upregulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, indicative of a shift toward pro-regenerative states following physiological activity enhancement. This activity-dependent reprogramming also extends to infiltrating monocytes and macrophages, collectively fostering a microenvironment favoring repair.",

    "title": "The transcription factor BCL11A restores differentiation potential to aged oligodendrocyte progenitor cells",
    "content": "In young animals, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) undergo robust differentiation, progressing through stages to become pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes (Pre-OL) and ultimately myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). However, OPCs from aged animals have reduced differentiation ability. This disrupts myelin maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a lack of remyelination following demyelinating injury and impaired adaptive myelination as a mechanism of learning. To uncover novel factors essential for restoring resilience in aged OPCs, we employed a data-driven approach involving the development of a computational pipeline, gSWITCH (accessible at: https://altoslabs.shinyapps.io/gSWITCH/), that allows for capture of precise dynamic gene expression patterns to pinpoint potential 'switch' genes during lineage progression. Using gSWITCH to identify potential switch genes crucial for OPCs, we conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in OPCs isolated from young and aged animals. This revealed a group of transcription factors with decreased expression in aged OPCs. Further analysis of transcription factor binding site enrichment in OPC switches highlighted Bcl11a, a zinc finger transcription factor that could potentially serve as a master regulator of many switch genes. Ectopic overexpression of Bcl11a in aged OPCs did not enhance their proliferation; however, it significantly enhanced their differentiation into OLs. Overexpression of Bcl11a in aged mice, followed by demyelination injury in spinal cord white matter, significantly increased the differentiation of OPCs into OLs within the injury region compared to control aged mice. Furthermore, we found that Bcl11a is absent in invertebrates and has undergone pervasive purifying selection throughout vertebrate evolution, constraining its amino-acid sequence by eliminating deleterious mutations. Our study shows that reversing the age-related decline of this evolutionarily conserved factor in aged OPCs restores their impaired capacity for differentiation.",

    "content": "Experimental advancements in neuroscience have identified cellular engrams - ensembles of neurons whose activation is necessary and sufficient for memory retrieval. Synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation, is key to memory encoding and recall, but the relationship between learning-induced dendritic spine potentiation and neuron-wide activation remains unclear. Here, we employ a post-synaptic translation-dependent potentiation reporter (SA-PSD{Delta}Venus) and a neuronal activation reporter (ESARE-dTurquoise) to determine their spatiotemporal correlation in the mouse hippocampal CA1 following contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Potentiated spines were enriched in activated neurons, with distribution varying across CA1 layers at different phases of memory: potentiated spines were more frequent in activated neurons in stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum moleculare after CFC (encoding), while recall-activated neurons showed a larger number of potentiated spines in the stratum radiatum. These findings demonstrate that the relative weight and spatial distribution of potentiated synaptic inputs to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons changes between the encoding and retrieval phases of memory.",

    "title": "Hippocampal Drift Rate Reflects the Temporal Organization of Memories",
    "content": "<p>When freely recalling past events, individuals tend to successively remember stimuli that were studied close together in time&mdash;a phenomenon known as temporal clustering. Temporal clustering is thought to occur because stimuli are encoded in relation to a slowly drifting internal context; this internal context representation is then reinstated during recall, leading to clustered recall of stimuli that share a similar internal context. While several lines of evidence implicate the hippocampus in supporting internal context representations, there is limited evidence directly linking hippocampal drift during memory encoding to subsequent temporal clustering during recall. In a human fMRI experiment (<i>n</i> = 38; 20 females and 18 males), we sought to influence the rate of internal context change during memory encoding and tested for corresponding effects on (1) temporal clustering and (2) hippocampal drift rate. To influence internal context, we manipulated the rate at which background scenes \"switched\" while a list of words was encoded. Afterward, subjects freely recalled as many words as possible. While switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering. Specifically, a higher switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern was mirrored by drift rate in the hippocampus: a higher switch rate was associated with significantly lower hippocampal autocorrelation (more drift). Moreover, individual differences in hippocampal autocorrelation were positively correlated with temporal clustering. Collectively, this suggests that hippocampal drift rate during encoding and temporal clustering during recall each reflects a common internal context representation.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages the cochlea and triggers downstream brain changes, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system; a feedback pathway originates in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. Recent evidence suggests that lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent system supports hearing recovery by sustaining auditory nerve activity for several weeks after acoustic trauma (Sitko et al., 2025); however, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we examined the long-term effects of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse LOC neurons of either sex. Under normal conditions, these neurons display a characteristic burst firing pattern driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated membrane voltage oscillations. One week following noise exposure, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, as a result of an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Moreover, LOC neurons exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents&mdash;a key process that shapes the duration of voltage oscillations&mdash;whose properties were also modified following noise exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation, CDI, and outward leak currents is sufficient to sustain the oscillating behavior of LOC neurons. We propose that NIHL increases efferent activity, thereby enhancing the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which may support long-lasting restoration of sensory coding in the damaged cochlea.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Listeners effortlessly extract multi-dimensional auditory objects, such as a localized talker, from complex acoustic scenes. However, the neural mechanisms that enable simultaneous encoding and linking of distinct sound features&mdash;such as a talker&rsquo;s voice and location&mdash;are not fully understood. Using invasive intracranial recordings in seven neurosurgical patients (four male, three female), we investigated how the human auditory cortex processes and integrates these features during naturalistic multi-talker scenes and how attentional mechanisms modulate such feature integration. We found that cortical sites exhibit a continuum of feature sensitivity, ranging from single-feature-sensitive sites (responsive primarily to voice spectral features or to location features) to dual-feature-sensitive sites (responsive to both features). At the population level, neural response patterns from both single- and dual-feature-sensitive sites jointly encoded the attended talker&rsquo;s voice and location. Notably, single-feature-sensitive sites encoded their primary feature with greater precision but also represented coarse information about the secondary feature. Sites selectively tracking a single, attended speech stream concurrently encoded both voice and location features, demonstrating a link between selective attention and feature integration. Additionally, attention selectively enhanced temporal coherence between voice- and location-sensitive sites, suggesting that temporal synchronization serves as a mechanism for linking these features. Our findings highlight two complementary neural mechanisms&mdash;joint population coding and temporal coherence&mdash;that enable the integration of voice and location features in the auditory cortex. These results provide new insights into the distributed, multi-dimensional nature of auditory object formation during active listening in complex environments.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Gating processes that regulate sensory input into visual working memory (WM) and the execution of planned actions share neural mechanisms, suggesting a mutual interaction. In a preregistered study (Open Science Framework), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed match-to-sample task. Participants (12 males, 20 females) memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a critical tool for assessing auditory brainstem function in biomedical mouse models. Remarkably, despite its importance, the origins of ABR waves specific to mice remain poorly identified. Here, we used EEG source reconstruction to reevaluate the mouse-specific ABR origins. We recorded the topography of ABRs using high-density EEG from the skull of adult mice of either sex combined with parallel multielectrode recordings in the auditory cortex. Individual ABR waves showed a series of distinct spatial topographies across the skull. Wave I&rsquo; was strongly lateralized, supporting its auditory nerve origin. Waves II/III were also lateralized but had a more frontal distribution, supporting an origin in the cochlear nucleus and olivary complex. A distinct shift in wave IV topography showed focused activity directly above the inferior colliculus (IC). Source localization with beamforming supported the origin of wave IV and V in the IC. In addition, the slow IC wave, P<sub>0</sub>, temporally overlapped with responses in the auditory cortex. We identify ABR wave IV as a marker of IC activity, separating earlier brainstem contributions (cochlear nucleus, olivary complex) from later thalamic and cortical components. This finding improves the anatomical specificity of the mouse ABR as a noninvasive marker in biomedical mouse models.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Aging affects the reproductive system, although its impact on GnRH neurons is mainly unexplored. Thus, we compared the transcriptome and electrophysiology of GnRH neurons obtained from female middle-aged (MA, 400&ndash;430&nbsp;d) and young (Y, 70&nbsp;d), diestrous mice, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reproductive senescence-related molecular changes in one-third of the MA mice. The upregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 225) were linked to immune signaling, olfactory- and vomeronasal receptors. The downregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 233) were related to mRNA processing, G-protein&ndash;coupled receptors, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport, and estrogen signaling. In addition, ion channel (Na, K, Ca), neurotransmitter (ACh, GABA, glutamate), and various neuropeptide receptor-coding genes showed differential expression indicating functional alterations of the cells. Accordingly, whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recordings revealed a twofold increase in spontaneous firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons. Significant changes were also observed in characteristics of action potentials and afterhyperpolarization amplitudes. Conspicuously, miniature postsynaptic currents were absent in 72% of MA-GnRH neurons, and pharmacological blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> and glutamate receptors didn't affect the firing rate. However, administration of their ligands evoked inward currents and facilitated firing in both animal groups, although with a decreased efficacy in MA animals. MA-GnRH neurons sustained responsiveness to estradiol, G-protein inhibition, and kisspeptin (KP) like those of young animals. While KP receptor antagonist, KP-234, diminished firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons, it had no effect on young GnRH cells. Collectively, these findings revealed that both the transcriptome and electrophysiological activity of GnRH neurons change at middle age and the explored alterations are hallmarks of early phase of reproductive senescence.</p>",

    "title": "Disentangling the Functional Roles of Premotor-Motor Pathways in Automatic Imitation: A Combined Network-Based Transcranial Stimulation and Drift Diffusion Modeling Approach",
    "content": "<p>Humans have an automatic tendency to imitate others&rsquo; actions, a process facilitated by the action observation network (AON). While motor nodes of the AON, such as the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the supplementary motor area (SMA), are engaged during automatic imitation, the distinct roles of their projections to the primary motor cortex (M1) remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the plasticity and functional role of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in healthy humans of either sex. We used a combination of corticocortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to modulate cortical connectivity strength and drift diffusion modeling to study the impact of ccPAS on the latent cognitive processes underlying automatic imitation. Our results show that manipulating PMv-to-M1 connectivity increases the baseline tendency to imitate actions, shifting the response toward or away from an imitative response when connectivity in this circuit is enhanced or hindered, respectively. Conversely, strengthening SMA-to-M1 connectivity does not affect this bias but improves contextual information integration, facilitating task-appropriate behavior, reflected by the drift rate parameter. These findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the functional roles of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways: the former pathway drives the automatic imitation bias, while the latter modulates the integration of contextual information to regulate imitation. By combining network-based brain stimulation with advanced behavioral analysis, this study provides causal evidence for the distinct cognitive functions supported by the PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in the facilitation and regulation of automatic imitation. Our findings offer insights into the neural mechanisms governing imitation and its context-dependent modulation.</p>",

    "title": "Superior Colliculus Projections Drive Dopamine Neuron Activity and Movement But Not Value",
    "content": "<p>To navigate dynamic environments, animals must rapidly integrate sensory information and respond appropriately to gather rewards and avoid threats. It is well established that dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) are key for creating associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict. Critically, it remains unclear how sensory information is integrated into DA pathways. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is positioned as a relay for DA neuron augmentation. We characterized the anatomy and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA/SNc in male and female rats. First, we show that neurons in the deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing with projections to the striatum and ventral pallidum, and these SC projections excite DA and GABA neurons in the VTA/SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neuron activation did not reliably evoke behavior in an optogenetic pavlovian conditioning paradigm, and activation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference/avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons evokes head turning. Focusing optogenetic activation solely onto DA neurons that receive input from the SC was sufficient to invigorate turning, but not reinforcement. Turning intensity increased with repeated stimulations, suggesting that this circuit may underlie sensorimotor learning for exploration and attentional switching. Together, our results show that collicular neurons contribute to cue-guided behaviors by controlling pose adjustments through interaction with DA neurons that preferentially engage movement instead of reward.</p>",

    "title": "The Virtual Brain Ontology: A Digital Knowledge Framework for Reproducible Brain Network Modeling",
    "content": "Computational models of brain network dynamics offer mechanistic insights into brain function and disease, and are utilized for hypothesis generation, data interpretation, and the creation of personalized digital brain twins. However, results remain difficult to reproduce and compare because equations, parameters, networks, and numerical settings are reported inconsistently across the literature, and shared code is often not fully documented, standardized, or executable. We introduce *The Virtual Brain Ontology* (TVB-O), a semantic knowledge base, minimal metadata standard, and Python toolbox that simplifies the description, execution, and sharing of network simulations. TVB-O offers 1) a common vocabulary and ontology for core concepts and axioms representing current domain knowledge for simulating brain network dynamics, 2) a minimal, human- and machine-readable metadata specification for the information needed to reproduce an experiment, 3) a curated database of published models, brain networks, and study configurations, and 4) software that generates executable code for various simulation platforms and programming languages, including The Virtual Brain, Jax, or Julia. FAIR metadata and provenance-aware reports can be exported from TVB-O's model specification. It hereby enables a flexible framework for adopting new models and enhances reproducibility, comparability, and portability across simulators, while making assumptions explicit and linking models to biomedical knowledge and observation pathways. By reducing technical barriers and standardizing workflows, TVB-O broadens access to computational neuroscience and establishes a foundation for transparent, shareable \"digital brain twins\" that integrate with clinical pipelines and large-scale data resources.",

    "title": "Independent Basal Ganglia Neural Populations Encode Speech Production and Ambient-Noise Levels",
    "content": "The function of the basal ganglia (BG), a set of nuclei deep in the brain, is still under debate despite their clinical relevance. Lines of evidence from non-human primate and human experiments suggest that one key causal contribution of the adult primate BG is invigoration of movement according to environmental and energetic constraints. Previous studies have come to this conclusion using primarily limb motor control tasks. We hypothesized BG are also important for invigorating the respiratory, vocal, and articulatory motor systems during speech production. To test this, we used a rare clinical opportunity to record local field potentials-broadband gamma activity (LFP-BGA) and single unit (SU) activity from human basal ganglia during deep brain stimulation implant surgeries. Participants repeated sentences aloud in the operating room. We modulated environmental and energetic constraints of speech production by inducing the Lombard Effect, wherein people reliably increase the intensity of their voice in the presence of background noise. Participants increased voice intensity, pitch, vowel space size, and respiratory depth in the presence of ambient noise. ~40% of LFP and SU sites were modulated by speech production. Comparing globus pallidus (GP) LFP-BGA, herein reported for the first time during speech, to subthalamic nucleus (STN) LFP-BGA revealed GP activated after STN. STN was more coincident with the speech preparatory period and GP more coincident with speech onset, suggesting differential roles in speech production. We found only weak evidence that STN or GP activity encodes the level of produced speech intensity. Instead, we found that LFP-BGA and SU-FR robustly track the ambient background noise levels. Linear decoding from SU-firing rate revealed we could infer the background noise levels with >75% accuracy in any given time point in the trial, including baseline. Importantly, the ambient-noise-modulated sites were an independent population from speech-modulated sites. We conclude that human BG encode the energetic constraints of communication. We theorize that the code is leveraged in downstream BG-cortical loop nodes to invigorate speech oro-motor gestures and co-speech manual limb gestures, both of which respond to ambient noise levels to maintain high-fidelity communication.",

    "title": "Identity Domains Reveal How Life Experiences and the Microbiome Shape Individuality and Uncover the Presence of Social Memory in Drosophila",
    "content": "Personality is comprised of enduring traits that shape behavior across contexts and over time. Yet outside humans, research often equates individuality with personality, focusing on how one animal differs from another in each behavior. This overlooks the latent space that spans an animal's behavioral repertoire, how it is shaped by innate tendencies and prior experiences, and how it differs from transient factors. Here, we bridge this gap by integrating a data-driven framework with unbiased trait interpretation via large language models, revealing how social, sexual, and physiological conditions systematically alter the expression of personality-like traits in Drosophila melanogaster. This approach yielded four identities: space-use (exploration), time-use (social investment), avoidance, and aggression. Large language models produced strong consensus on the interpretation of some of these axes and divergence on others. These dimensions proved stable within individuals yet shifted predictably following mating, isolation, and microbiome manipulation, often in sex dependent ways. Notably, flies behaved differently toward familiar and unfamiliar peers, revealing a capacity for social memory. These findings bridge temperament and personality, showing how life history reshapes baseline tendencies into individualized profiles within constrained dimensions. They establish Drosophila as a tractable system for uncovering the biological logic of personality and advancing cross-species principles for individuality research.",

    "title": "A novel method to sort and enrich sensory neurons",
    "content": "Peripheral sensory neurons, residing in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), relay sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Although single-cell transcriptomic studies have identified over 20 distinct sensory neuron subtypes, functional analysis and assessment of subtype-specific pathological changes remain difficult. Effective isolation and enrichment of sensory neurons are challenging yet essential for functional studies. Therefore, we used single-cell transcriptomic data from DRG to identify a panel of neuronal surface markers, including Nrxn2 and Pirt. Using these markers, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) panel for neuronal enrichment and analysis that does not rely on transgenic mouse strains and can be broadly applied. The panel was validated by microscopy and single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing, which also revealed broad representation of neuronal subtypes. Expression of these markers in human DRG underscores the translational value of this isolation method for sensory and pain studies. Overall, this study provides a valuable tool for isolating DRG neurons, advancing research on sensory neuron function and pain biology, and facilitating neuroimmune studies.",

    "title": "Immature C. elegans motor neurons control early embryo behavior via both synaptic and non-synaptic GABA release",
    "content": "Pre-natal brain activity has long lasting effects on subsequent neurodevelopment. It is unclear if early brain activity is dominated by cell intrinsic, synaptic, or non-synaptic mechanisms. We address this question by analyzing C. elegans embryo behavior in snf-11 mutants, which lack a plasma membrane GABA re-uptake pump (orthologous to GAT1). At 510-570 minutes post-fertilization, embryo motion was transiently and potently inhibited in snf-11 GAT1 mutants, which precedes formation of most nerve ring synapses. This transient motion inhibition requires GABA synthesis in DD motor neurons and UNC-49 GABAA receptors in body muscles. When motion inhibition occurs, DD neurons have not yet completed neurite outgrowth. Genetic analysis suggests that motion inhibition was mediated by both synaptic and tonic GABA release from DD motor neurons. These results suggest that DD neurons control embryo behavior prior to completing their developmental maturation.",

    "title": "Convergent and divergent spatial topographies of individualized brain functional networks and their developmental origins",
    "content": "The human brain is intrinsically organized into canonical functional networks with distinct spatial topographies. While precision functional mapping delineates individualized topographies of single networks, the spatial coordination among networks and its developmental origin remains largely unknown. Here, we propose functional topography covariance analysis (FOCA), a novel framework that quantifies convergent and divergent spatial alignments across individualized functional networks and further delineates their internetwork relationships, neurobiological basis, ontogenetic layouts, and cognitive outcomes. Across two well-established task-free functional MRI (fMRI) datasets encompassing both conventional and densely sampled scans, FOCA consistently revealed self-clustered hierarchies in the coordination of functional topographies, closely aligned with existing functional gradients and characterized by convergent couplings within primary systems and divergent couplings in higher-order systems. Such pattern was well predicted by fundamental neurobiological attributes, especially aerobic glycolysis. In a large public neonatal cohort, FOCA matrix exhibited adult-inverted hierarchical couplings and marked changes in auditory and action-mode networks, primarily driven by prominent redistributions of negative couplings. Moreover, neonatal FOCA profiles in the primary visual system significantly predicted neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months. Finally, compared with conventional functional connectivity (FC), FOCA proved more robust to global signals and more sensitive to the maturation of negative couplings. These findings highlight the critical role of negative connectivity in brain functional reorganization and advance our understanding of the cooperative and competitive relationships among functional systems and their developmental origins.",

    "content": "<p>Hey HN! We\u2019re Adish & Kyle from Mosaic (<a href=\"https://mosaic.so\">https://mosaic.so</a>). Mosaic lets you create and run your own multimodal video editing agents in a node-based canvas. It\u2019s different from traditional video editing tools in two ways: (1) the user interface and (2) the visual intelligence built into our agent.<p>We were engineers at Tesla and one day had a fun idea to make a YouTube video of Cybertrucks in Palo Alto. We recorded hours of cars driving by, but got stuck on how to scrub through all this raw footage to edit it down to just the Cybertrucks.<p>We got frustrated trying to accomplish simple tasks in video editors like DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro. Features are hidden behind menus, buttons, and icons, and we often found ourselves Googling or asking ChatGPT how to do certain edits.<p>We thought that surely now, with multimodal AI, we could accelerate this process. Better yet, an AI video editor could automatically apply edits based off what it sees and hears in your video. The idea quickly snowballed and we began our side quest to build \u201cCursor for Video Editing\u201d.<p>We put together a prototype and to our amazement, it was able to analyze and add text overlays based on what it saw or heard in the video. We could now automate our Cybertruck counting with a single chat prompt. That prototype is shown here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXr7q7Dl9X0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXr7q7Dl9X0</a>.<p>After that, we spent a chunk of time building our own timeline-based video editor and making our multimodal copilot powerful and stateful. In natural language, we could now ask chat to help with AI asset generation, enhancements, searching through assets, and automatically applying edits like dynamic text overlays. That version is shown here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/X4ki-QEwN40\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/X4ki-QEwN40</a>.<p>After talking to users though, we realized that the chat UX has limitations for video: (1) the longer the video, the more time it takes to process. Users have to wait too long between chat responses. (2) Users have set workflows that they use across video projects. Especially for people who have to produce a lot of content, the chat interface is a bottleneck rather than an accelerant.<p>That took us back to first principles to rethink what a \u201cnon-linear editor\u201d really means. The result: a node-based canvas which enables you to create and run your own multimodal video editing agents. <a href=\"https://screen.studio/share/SP7DItVD\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://screen.studio/share/SP7DItVD</a>.<p>Each tile in the canvas represents a video editing operation and is configurable, so you still have creative control. You can also branch and run edits in parallel, creating multiple variants from the same raw footage to A/B test different prompts, models, and workflows. In the canvas, you can see inline how your content evolves as the agent goes through each step.<p>The idea is that canvas will run your video editing on autopilot, and get you 80-90% of the way there. Then you can adjust and modify it in an inline timeline editor. We support exporting your timeline state out to traditional editing tools like DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.<p>We\u2019ve also used multimodal AI to build in visual understanding and intelligence. This gives our system a deep understanding of video concepts, emotions, actions, spoken word, light levels, shot types.<p>We\u2019re doing a ton of additional processing in our pipeline, such as saliency analysis, audio analysis, and determining objects of significance\u2014all to help guide the best edit. These are things that we as human editors internalize so deeply we may not think twice about it, but reverse-engineering the process to build it into the AI agent has been an interesting challenge.<p>Some of our analysis findings:\nOptimal Safe Rectangles: <a href=\"https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage1.png</a>\nVideo Analysis: <a href=\"https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage2.png</a>\nSaliency Analysis: <a href=\"https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage3.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage3.png</a>\nMean Movement Analysis: <a href=\"https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage4.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage4.png</a><p>Use cases for editing include: - Removing bad takes or creating script-based cuts from videos / talking-heads - Repurposing longer-form videos into clips, shorts, and reels (e.g. podcasts, webinars, interviews) - Creating sizzle reels or montages from one or many input videos - Creating assembly edits and rough cuts from one or many input videos - Optimizing content for various social media platforms (reframing, captions, etc.) - Dubbing content with voice cloning and lip syncing.<p>We also support use cases for generating content such as motion graphic animations, cinematic captions, AI UGC content, adding contextual AI-generated B-Rolls to existing content, or modifying existing video footage (changing lighting, applying VFX).<p>Currently, our canvas can be used to build repeatable agentic workflows, but we\u2019re working on a fully autonomous agent which will be able to do things like: style transfer using existing video content, define its own editing sequence / workflow without needing a canvas, do research and pull assets from web references, and so on.<p>You can try it today at <a href=\"https://edit.mosaic.so\">https://edit.mosaic.so</a>.

    "title": "Emergence of Individualized Functional Topography in the Neonatal Brain",
    "content": "The early postnatal period represents a critical phase for establishing the brain's fundamental architecture. However, how individualized functional topography emerges and shapes long-term cognition remains unknown. Using multimodal neuroimaging data from 419 neonates, we map personalized functional topographies in the first weeks of life and reveal their association with 18-month neurocognitive outcomes. Unique and stable functional topographies are already present at birth, with interindividual variability organized along a conserved sensorimotor-to-association hierarchy. These individualized maps encode early brain maturity and robustly predict cognitive, language, and motor outcomes at 18-month of age, with predictive features concentrated at network boundaries. This functional refinement is structurally anchored by concurrent maturation in cortical myelination and sulcal depth. Preterm birth results in distinctive topographic alterations characterized by accelerated maturation of association networks. Our work establishes a foundation for precision models of early brain development and elucidates its significance for long-term neurocognitive outcomes.",

    "title": "Association between white-matter lesion volume and heart-rate variability: A comparison of T1, T1-T2 and T1-FLAIR-based segmentations using FreeSurfer SAMSEG",
    "content": "Background: Heart disease is a crucial risk factor for brain degeneration, but the exact mechanisms are still under investigation. Notably, a growth in white-matter lesion (WML) volume, a hallmark of cerebral small-vessel disease (cSVD) with connections to progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, has been linked to cardiovascular disease. As such, measures of cardiovascular function such as heart rate variability may represent early and accessible predictors of WML development. Methods: This study used data from healthy adults drawn from the Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions (LEMON) dataset to examine heart function through measures of heart rate variability (HRV), as well as their relationship to cSVD as quantified through WML volumes, using FreeSurfer SAMSEG. WML volumes were segmented using 3T T1+FLAIR, T1+T2 or T1 images alone. Results: Results indicate that both young and old adults exhibited WMLs, and that lower HRV was associated with higher WML volume. This was particularly strong for high-frequency HRV across both young and older adults, but it was low-frequency HRV that was related to WML volume in an age-specific manner. Moreover, we showed that the WML-HRV relationship that is apparent using T1+FLAIR or T1+T2 based WML volumes could be observed even with T1w-based WML estimation alone. Conclusions: These results suggest HRV not only as an avenue through which cardiovascular risk translates into brain degeneration, but also as a potential early and readily measurable non-invasive predictor of later WML development and cognitive impairment.",

    "title": "A ventral hippocampus to nucleus accumbens pathway regulates impulsivity",
    "content": "Heightened impulsivity is attributed with substance abuse disorders, gambling, and obesity. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) has recently been linked with impulse control, yet the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms through which this control occurs are unknown. A subset of vHPC neurons project to the nucleus accumbens (ACB), a brain region known for regulating reward and motivation. Here, we evaluated the role of vHPC-ACB signaling in food-directed impulsivity using fiber photometry and transsynaptic chemogenetic and behavioral approaches. Male and female rats were trained in the differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) test of impulsive action, where they learn to withhold lever presses for 20 seconds to obtain a palatable food reward. Photometry recordings during DRL revealed analogous elevations in calcium-dependent activity in the vHPC and ACB during the 5s immediately prior to a non-impulsive vs. an impulsive response. Chemogenetic silencing of ACB-projecting vHPC neurons elevated impulsive responses in DRL relative to vehicle treatment in males but not females, yet had no effect on home cage food intake, operant-based motivation to work for palatable food, impulsive choice, or anxiety-like behavior. To determine whether this impulse control circuit requires vHPC->ACB communication independent of collateral targets of ACB-projecting vHPC neurons, we utilized a novel transsynaptic viral approach to selectively silence ACB neurons that receive synaptic glutamatergic signaling from the vHPC. Results reveal that inhibition of ACB neurons receiving vHPC signaling elevates impulsive action in the DRL task relative to vehicle treatment. Collective results reveal a hippocampal-striatal circuit that regulates impulsive action in males.",

Where possible it uses the vendored <a href=\"https://github.com/sharkdp/fd\"><code>fd</code></a> binary for fast file searches and can optionally locally cache file paths of the full collection for even faster searches (great for collections stored on the network, where file scanning is usually slow).</p> <p>It's a simple, straight-forward tool for people who prefer the terminal over GUI-based alternatives and just want to find and play files based on filename.

    "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
    "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

    "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Neurobehavioral concomitants of alcohol use in older healthy adults",
    "content": "Few laboratory studies permitting granular analyses of alcohol use on neurobehavioral processes in older adults have been reported. This study, reporting baseline data from an on-going longitudinal project, seeks to address this gap. Toward that end, working memory (WM) processes were targeted using the continuous recognition version of the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). Healthy male and female drinkers aged 65\u201380 years completed self-report measures of substance use, negative affect and demographics prior to testing. Drinking patterns were quantified on the basis of typical standard drinks/day (D/D). Behavioral data were obtained in a two-button forced choice paradigm. Neurophysiological data were obtained for each stimulus presentation with analyses focusing on a mid-frontal negative shift occurring \u223c 300\u2013500 ms post stimulus (FN400) and a posterior positive shift occurring \u223c 550\u2013800 ms after stimulus presentation (LPC). To constrain the models, for the behavioral analyses correlations between D/D, measures of negative affect, stimulus condition (\u201cnew,\u201d \u201cidentical,\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d) and performance were conducted. They indicated that only accuracy in labeling \u201cnew\u201d items was related to D/D. Subsequent least squares regression revealed that D/D was inversely related to accuracy for new items. In a sensitivity analysis removing THC users, the D/D effect was retained. Correlations incorporating mean amplitudes for the FN400 and LPC failed to reveal identifiable patterns. Consequently, separate mixed models (e.g., stimulus condition) for FN400 and LPC were conducted. D/D was not predictive of the FN400 for any stimulus condition. It was negatively related to the LPC mean amplitude. In post-hoc analyses, the effect was most notable for \u201cnew\u201d stimuli. After removing THC users, the magnitude and direction of the D/D effect was retained, although the p value fell short of significance. Primary models failed to reveal sex main or interaction effects. However, exploratory post-hoc analyses justify their continued study. These data lend preliminary support for the hypothesis that sustained drinking among older adults may negatively impact neurobehavioral processes. They are also consistent with expectations that alcohol effects may be modest and constrained by specific process. Importantly, these outcomes will be expanded through on-going longitudinal study, extending investigation to study of alcohol-related cognitive decline.",

    "title": "A computational framework combining neuronal dynamics and evolutionary game theory for network-level synaptic interactions",
    "content": "Objective. In this study, we present a novel computational framework that combines the Hindmarsh\u2013Rose (HR) neuronal model with evolutionary game theory on networks to simulate and interpret synaptic-level interactions within neuronal populations. Our approach preserves the features of the HR model\u2014capable of generating both spiking and bursting dynamics\u2014while integrating game-theoretic principles that govern the balance between emulative and non-emulative behaviors across neurons. Approach. Neurons were modeled as strategic agents whose interactions evolve according to game-theoretic principles, allowing us to capture emergent network dynamics beyond classical electrophysiological analyses. A key innovation of our work is the formulation of a parameter estimation method based on adaptive observers, which enables the recovery of game-theoretic parameters solely from partial state observations. The proposed framework is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability to recover hidden parameters and accurately predict system behavior under diverse conditions. Main results. By applying the devised approach to synthetic datasets mimicking real electrophysiological recordings, we highlight its applicability in distinguishing neuronal populations based on their strategic interactions. In this context, the model is shown to faithfully reproduce both spiking and bursting behaviors, capturing the diverse electrophysiological patterns observed in in vitro experimental settings. Furthermore, we explore the potential of this model in experimental data analysis by suggesting that the estimated parameters may serve as discriminative markers for different neuronal types and structural characteristics. Significance. The integration of dynamical systems theory, game-theoretic modeling, and adaptive estimation provides a robust quantitative tool for investigating complex neuronal network dynamics. Our results quantitatively demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of the method in parameter estimation, reinforcing its value for systematic analysis of synaptic interactions and advancing our understanding of neuronal network dynamics.",

    "title": "Patient-specific long-term seizure prediction via multi-model classification",
    "content": "Objective. Most existing seizure prediction approaches rely on cohort-based models or assume a single model suffices per patient, overlooking clinical and electrophysiological variability across seizures. This study aims to overcome these limitations by introducing a subject-specific seizure prediction framework that models intra-subject heterogeneity by identifying and clustering seizure-specific preictal patterns using long-term intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected over a one to two week duration. Approach: Absolute, relative, and ratio power spectral density features are extracted from twelve frequency bands, and the minimum uncertainty and sample elimination algorithm is used for unsupervised feature selection on a per-seizure basis. Weighted aggregation is then applied to form seizure-specific feature sets. Seizures are grouped into clusters based on feature similarity, and separate classifiers are trained for each cluster. Model predictions are combined using a grid optimized k-of-N voting strategy. Evaluation is conducted on long-term iEEG recordings from ten patients using cross-validation across seizure-containing sessions. Main results. When clustering is applied, the mean sensitivity across subjects is improved from 89.17% to 98.54%, while the mean FPR is reduced from 1.15/day to 0.62/day. Additionally, the median number of features required per subject decreased from 22 to 14, reflecting a 36.4% reduction in model complexity. Finally, in 72.5% of subject-folds, the number of algorithm-identified clusters equaled or exceeded the clinically annotated seizure types, with a linear trend indicating latent electrophysiological variability beyond clinical labels. Significance. These findings highlight the value of modeling seizure diversity within individuals and support the development of more personalized and interpretable seizure forecasting systems.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
    "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

    "title": "Universal differential equations as a unifying modeling language for neuroscience",
    "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "The Role of Pavlovian Bias in Smoking Cessation Success and Neurocognitive Alterations During Nicotine Withdrawal",
    "content": "Background: Inability to manage conflicts between multiple decision-making systems is associated with various mental disorders including addiction. The imbalance between the Pavlovian and instrumental systems may contribute to smoking cessation failure and relapse, as excessive Pavlovian motivation may override goal-directed quitting attempts. However, the exact role of the Pavlovian bias in smoking cessation and its neurocognitive mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: Eighty-six smokers participated in a smoking cessation clinic, completing the well-established orthogonalized go-nogo task before and after the intervention. We applied computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses to investigate the role of Pavlovian bias and its neural correlates in predicting smoking cessation outcomes. Results: Computational modeling revealed that higher levels of Pavlovian bias were associated with treatment failures. Importantly, Pavlovian bias significantly moderated the relationship between clinic participation rate and the likelihood of smoking cessation, suggesting that such bias can undermine motivational effort to quit. Furthermore, individuals who successfully quit smoking exhibited increased Pavlovian bias toward reward following cessation, indicating a potential cognitive mechanism underlying the relapse cycle. Complementary fMRI analyses demonstrated that Pavlovian bias influenced valence encoding in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), suggesting altered decision-making neural circuits. Conclusions: Pavlovian bias can be a critical risk factor of relapse in the smoking population, while this bias can be increased in response to nicotine abstinence. Moreover, the results highlight the roles of the vmPFC in decision-making under Pavlovian-instrumental conflict, providing insights into the neural underpinnings of relapse vulnerability. Understanding these mechanisms may guide targeted interventions to enhance smoking cessation outcomes.",

    "title": "Hedonic hotspot in rat olfactory tubercle: map for mu-opioid, orexin, and muscimol enhancement of sucrose 'liking'.",
    "content": "Pleasure plays a crucial role in positive reinforcement and motivation. Brain regions able to amplify positive hedonic reactions to sweetness, known as 'hedonic hotspots', are distributed within the mesocorticolimbic reward systems. The olfactory tubercle (OT), a part of the ventral striatum that receives olfactory input, contains distinct functional domains: the anteromedial domain mediates approach motivation toward odors associated with food, whereas the lateral domain mediates avoidance motivation away from odors associated with danger. However, it has remained unclear whether the OT modulates hedonic reactions to pleasant sensations. In this study, we made pharmacological microinjections in OT of in rats to examine whether these OT subregions can modulate hedonic reactions, as assessed by the taste reactivity test. Sweet oral infusions of sucrose solution were delivered into the mouth via an intraoral cannula, and the rats' orofacial and somatic hedonic reactions were recorded and analyzed. We compared three pharmacological agents: mu-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO, orexin-A peptide, and GABAA receptor agonist muscimol. Microinjection of any of these drugs into the anteromedial OT subregion enhanced hedonic 'liking' reactions to sucrose. Furthermore, DAMGO injection into the anteromedial OT subregion recruited distant Fos expression in other 'hedonic hotspots', including in the caudal ventral pallidum and the rostromedial orbitofrontal cortex. By contrast, the same microinjections into the anterolateral OT subregion failed to enhance 'liking' reactions and, DAMGO oppositely increased aversive 'disgust' reactions. These findings suggest that the anteromedial OT contains a 'hedonic hotspot', whereas the anterolateral OT may contain a suppressive opioid 'hedonic coldspot'. Thus, OT subregions may help causally modulate hedonic reactions to sweetness and flavor perception.",

    "title": "Human assembloid model of emergent neurotropic enteroviruses",
    "content": "Enteroviruses (EVs) are the leading cause of viral meningitis in children. Recent outbreaks of non-polio EVs, most notably EV-A71 and EV-D68, have been associated with a polio-like paralysis known as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). The lack of relevant models that mimic the cellular and functional responses of these human-restricted pathogens has hampered the development of effective treatments. We have previously engineered human stem cell-derived assembloids that recapitulate the neuromuscular connections underlying muscle contractions by integrating human spinal cord/hindbrain organoids (hSpO) and human skeletal muscle. Here, we used organoids and assembloids to investigate polio and non-polio EV pathogenesis. Infection of assembloids with poliovirus (PV), EV-D68 and EV-A71 resulted in loss of muscle contraction for all three viruses, which could be prevented by treatment with an antiviral agent. Yet, despite the convergence on neuronal dysfunction, the cellular targets by which each virus acted differed. More specifically, single cell transcriptomic profiling uncovered divergent cell tropisms between the EVs, and live imaging experiments revealed different modes and kinetics of cell damage. Altogether, we describe a multi-cellular model that captures viral pathogenesis in a human and circuit-relevant context.",

    "title": "CNS Myelin Sheath Lengths Locally Scale to Axon Diameter via Piezo1",
    "content": "Myelin sheath lengths vary by an order of magnitude in the central nervous system (CNS) and tune the timing of neuronal signaling. Thus, variation in myelin sheath length has been proposed to coordinate the timing of neuronal signaling to ultimately impact behavior. The mechanisms to establish myelin sheath length are unknown. For decades, reports have documented that in vivo myelin sheath size scales with the diameter of the ensheathed axon. We previously demonstrated diameter is sufficient to instruct myelin sheath lengths formed by oligodendrocytes using a synthetic axon culture system. The mechanisms of oligodendrocyte diameter-sensing and its translation into sheath elongation are still unknown. Here we demonstrate that diameter-sensing and sheath length is locally regulated: each individual myelin sheath responds to the underlying fiber diameter. We uncover a novel mechanism for scaling myelin sheath length to fiber diameter, through mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. In vivo, Piezo1 impacts the elongation of myelin sheaths on large diameter axons, recapitulating our in vitro results. Yet, surprisingly, there is no impact on myelin thickness with conditional Piezo1 loss. We propose Piezo1 provides a mechanism to establish hard-wired myelin sheath patterns, where oligodendrocytes transduce axon diameter into generating myelin segments with vastly different lengths.",

    "title": "Scalable Human Cellular Models of Parkinson Disease Reveal A Druggable Link Between the Angiotensin Receptor 1 and Alpha-Synuclein Pathology",
    "content": "Background: Parkinson s disease (PD) involves progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the substantia nigra. No disease-modifying treatments exist, only symptomatic relief. Our lab reported an unbiased screen in larval zebrafish identifying renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, including clinically used AGTR1 inhibitors for hypertension, as potent neuroprotective agents. This study aims to investigate the effects of AGTR1 inhibition on human mDA neuron survival using inducible neurodegenerative 2D and 3D models for human mDA neuron degeneration. Methods: We report a scalable high-content platform, using CRISPR-engineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived mDA neurons expressing a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) fluorescent reporter, allowing to track mDA neuron survival live in a dish. We developed chemically inducible neurodegenerative 2D and 3D models for human mDA neuron degeneration, allowing to recapitulate PD pathology in human cells in vitro. Results: Our model establishes scalable human cellular models of PD well-suited for therapeutic discovery. Using 2D and 3D mono and co-cultures, this study demonstrates that inhibition of AGTR1, via chemical or genetic means, protects against chemically induced mDA neuron degeneration. Transcriptomic analyses show AGTR1 inhibition lowers synuclein transcription, by reducing SNCA and SNCB gene expression. In 3D neuron-glia assembloids, AGTR1 inhibition protects against the accumulation of phosphorylated form of a-synuclein (p129a Syn), key PD pathological marker. Conclusions: We highlight AGTR1 as a key regulator of -synuclein transcription and aggregation in human mDA neurons, and AGTR1 inhibition as pro-survival in human iPSC-derived models. These findings position inhibition of AGTR1 as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD neuroprotection.",

    "title": "Aesthetics, illusion of success and age interactions: disentangling effects in the closed-loop design with sham neurofeedback training",
    "content": "This study examined the influence of the aesthetics of visual feedback stimuli in neurofeedback training (NFB). Previous research shows a lack of specific design standards in NFB research and its application. Beyond limited literature on continuous and intermittent feedback presentation effects, most NFB design parameters remain largely understudied. Studies in the context of interface design has pointed at possible effects of aesthetics and task difficulty, indicating an interaction effect of aesthetics on performance and perseverance in difficult task conditions. The study at hand evaluates whether similar effects emerge in the context of NFB. In order to address this question, aesthetics and NFB illusion of success were manipulated experimentally in a sham NFB study (N = 24) following a 2 \u00d7 2 within-subjects design. The main dependent variables were perseverance behavior, subjective workload, motivation, and EEG activity. Results indicated an interaction between pleasing design, illusion of success, and participant age affecting perseverance and physical demand. Alpha-1 band amplitudes were modulated by an interaction between pleasing design and age, and a main effect of the illusion of success emerged. Surprisingly, only the illusion of success variable appeared to exert a meaningful influence on the workload and motivation context. Discussing the observed results, the study partially confirms the hypothesis of aesthetics affecting the outcome when the task is difficult in the context of NFB. The relevance of the age variable is addressed, and potential effects in the context of executive functioning and technology adoption processes are considered. Results encourage further research on the topic of NFB design optimization, including verum NFB in the patient population to increase NFB therapy potential.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Focus is a Python library that removes backgrounds from images with improved edge detection, especially for complex objects like hair, fur, and fine details. It runs entirely locally on your machine and returns standard PIL Images that work with your existing Python image processing workflow.</p> <p><strong>Quick example:</strong></p> <pre><code>from withoutbg import WithoutBG # Initialize model once, reuse for multiple images (efficient!) model = WithoutBG.opensource() result = model.remove_background(&quot;input.jpg&quot;) # Returns PIL Image.Image result.save(&quot;output.png&quot;) # Standard PIL operations work! result.show() # View instantly result.resize((500, 500)) # Resize result.save(&quot;output.webp&quot;, quality=95) # Different format </code></pre> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This library is for Python developers who need background removal in their applications:</p> <ul> <li>Web developers building image editing tools</li> <li>Automation engineers handling product photos at scale</li> <li>Anyone who wants local background removal without API dependencies</li> </ul> <h1>Why I Built This</h1> <p>Most background removal tools struggle with fine details. I wanted something that:</p> <ul> <li>Handles hair/fur edges cleanly</li> <li>Runs locally (no API calls required)</li> <li>Has a simple, Pythonic API</li> <li>Works seamlessly with PIL/Pillow</li> </ul> <h1>Results</h1> <p>I've posted unfiltered test results here: <a href=\"https://withoutbg.com/resources/background-removal-results/model-focus-open-source?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=focus-launch\">Focus Model Results</a></p> <p>Not cherry-picked. You'll see where it works well and where it fails.</p> <h1>Installation</h1> <pre><code>uv pip install withoutbg # or pip install withoutbg## Technical Details </code></pre> <ul> <li>Fully open source (Apache 2.0)</li> <li>Runs locally (downloads model on first use)</li> <li>Returns PIL Images, can save directly to file</li> <li>Initialize once, reuse for batch processing</li> </ul> <p><strong>Docs:</strong> <a href=\"https://withoutbg.com/documentation/integrations/python-sdk?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=focus-launch\">Python SDK Documentation</a></p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/withoutbg/withoutbg?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=focus-launch\">withoutbg/withoutbg</a></p> <p>Would love feedback from the Python community, especially on the API design and any edge cases you encounter!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Naive_Artist5196\"> /u/Naive_Artist5196 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p0d27g/focus_background_removal_library_with_improved/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p0d27g/focus_background_removal_library_with_improved/\">[comments]</a></span>",

At the same time, technological innovation is driving a shift toward AI-powered diagnostics, immersive learning tools, and neurostimulation-based interventions.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes evidence from recent research published between 2015 and 2025, focusing on four thematic areas: (1) neurobiological underpinnings of dyslexia, (2) diagnostic innovations using AI and eye- or handwriting-based deep learning, (3) neurostimulation and immersive VR/AR interventions, and (4) policy, equity, and ethical considerations. Studies were identified through major academic databases and thematically analyzed to highlight trends, strengths, and limitations.ResultsAI-based diagnostic tools using eye-tracking and handwriting features have achieved reported accuracies exceeding 80% in multiple pilot studies. VR/game-based programs and neurostimulation interventions (TMS, tDCS) have shown promising short-term effects on reading fluency and phonological processing, though evidence for long-term literacy transfer remains limited. Across studies, methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes constrain generalizability. Significant disparities in access persist across socioeconomic, linguistic, and geographic contexts.ConclusionsWhile these technologies offer promising avenues for more personalized and scalable dyslexia care, their integration must be accompanied by stronger evidence, ethical safeguards, and equity-focused policies. Technology should augment, not replace, human interaction in inclusive education. Future research should prioritize larger trials, cross-linguistic validation, and sustainable implementation strategies.",

    "content": "Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, plays a critical role in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and is strongly associated with neuronal cell death. Nocturnin was identified as a NADP(H) phosphatase and key regulator of oxidative stress. NADPH serves as a crucial co-factor for enzymes which regenerate antioxidants, and downregulation of its levels increases sensitivity to oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration. In this study, we examined how the loss of Nocturnin impacts redox homeostasis and neuronal survival in Cath.a-differentiated (CAD) cells and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a mutant alpha-synuclein overexpression PD mouse model (DASYN53). Here we demonstrate that loss of Nocturnin increases CAD cell viability by increasing total glutathione levels, boosting metabolites involved in antioxidant defense, and reducing oxidative damage. Additionally, Nocturnin deletion in DASYN53 mice promotes midbrain dopaminergic neuron survival. These findings suggest that the loss of Nocturnin protects neurons from oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant defense, which rescues neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons.",

Existing risk-detection methods excel at identifying collisions but face challenges in assessing the behavior of road users in non-collision situations. This paper introduces Visionary Co-Driver, a system that leverages large language models to identify non-collision roadside risks and alert drivers based on their eye movements. Specifically, the system combines video processing algorithms and LLMs to identify potentially risky road users. These risks are dynamically indicated on an adaptive heads-up display interface to enhance drivers' attention. A user study with 41 drivers confirms that Visionary Co-Driver improves drivers' risk perception and supports their recognition of roadside risks.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.14231v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study examines the evolving impact of algorithmic management on human resource management (HRM) practices, with a focus on employee autonomy, procedural transparency, and the sociotechnical dynamics of performance evaluation. Rather than adopting a qualitative or empirical approach, the paper develops a conceptual integration of insights from HRM, human-computer interaction (HCI), and Science and Technology Studies. The analysis highlights that although algorithmic systems can enhance operational efficiency, they risk reinforcing biases and narrowing the relational and contextual dimensions of work. These systems often overlook intangible contributions such as creativity, empathy, and collaborative problem solving, revealing gaps in data-driven performance measurement. In response, the study proposes a sociotechnical perspective on algorithmic accountability that emphasizes procedural transparency, organizational justice, and employee agency. By revisiting foundational questions within the rapidly evolving landscape of algorithmic management, the paper contributes to ongoing debates about the future of work and the design of managerial technologies that support, rather than constrain, human autonomy and organizational life.",

    "title": "A Longitudinal Study on the Attitudes of Gay Men in Beijing Towards Gay Social Media Platforms: Lonely Souls in the Digital Concrete Jungle",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.14174v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Over the past decade, specialized social networking applications have become a cornerstone of life for many gay men in China. This paper employs a longitudinal mixed-methods approach to investigate how Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) have shifted their attitudes toward these platforms between approximately 2013 and 2023. Drawing on archival analysis of online discourses, a quantitative survey of 412 participants, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 32 participants, we trace the complex trajectory of this evolution. Our findings reveal a clear pattern: from the initial embrace of these applications as revolutionary tools for community building and identity affirmation (2014--2017), to a period of growing ambivalence and critique centered on commercialization, ``hookup culture,'' and multiple forms of discrimination (2017--2020), and finally to the present era (2020--2023), characterized by pragmatic, fragmented, yet simultaneously critical and reconstructive uses. Today, users strategically employ a repertoire of applications -- including global platforms (e.g., Grindr and Tinder), domestic mainstream platforms (e.g., Blued), and niche alternatives (e.g., Aloha) -- to fulfill differentiated needs. We develop a detailed temporal framework to capture this attitudinal evolution and discuss its design implications for creating more supportive, secure, and community-oriented digital environments for marginalized groups.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.14164v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study explores the design of Intelligent User Interfaces (IUIs) to address the profound existential loneliness of terminally ill individuals. While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has made inroads in \"Thanatechnology,\" current research often focuses on practical aspects like digital legacy management, overlooking the subjective, existential needs of those facing death in isolation. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 lonely, terminally ill individuals. Our core contributions are: (1) An empirically-grounded model articulating the complex psychological, practical, social, and spiritual needs of this group; (2) The \"Three Pillars, Twelve Principles\" framework for designing IUIs as \"Existential Companions\"; and (3) A critical design directive derived from user evaluations: technology in this context should aim for transcendence over simulation. The findings suggest that IUIs should create experiences that augment or surpass human capabilities, rather than attempting to simulate basic human connections, which can paradoxically deepen loneliness. This research provides a clear, user-centered path for designing technology that serves not as a \"tool for dying,\" but as a \"partner for living fully until the end\".",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.14118v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mysophobia, or the fear of germs, is a prevalent anxiety disorder that significantly impacts daily life. This study investigates the potential of a gamified virtual reality (VR) intervention to simulate contamination-related scenarios and assess their emotional and psychological effects. A VR game based sneeze simulation was developed to evaluate its influence on participants' emotional states. Seven participants completed two versions of the game: a baseline version and an experimental version featuring the sneeze simulation. Emotional responses were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State (STAI-S) questionnaires. The results revealed slight increases in negative affect and anxiety levels during the sneeze simulation. Also, a reduction in positive affect was revealed. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). This is likely due to small sample sizes, a lack of grossness in the simulation, or participants not being clinically mysophobes. This exploratory study highlights the potential of VR-based interventions for understanding and addressing contamination-related anxieties. It provides a foundation for future research with larger and more diverse participant pools.",

The paper examines the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) from engineering points of view to clarify its nature and limits. The paper argues that the rationality underlying humanity's impulse to pursue, articulate, and adhere to rules deserves to be valued and preserved. Identifying where rule-based practical rationality ends is the beginning of making it aware until action. Although the rules of AI behaviors are still hidden or only weakly observable, the paper has proposed a methodology to make a sense of discrimination possible and practical to identify the distinctions of the behavior of AI models with three types of decisions. It is a prerequisite for human responsibilities with alternative possibilities, considering how and when to use AI. It would be a solid start for people to ensure AI system soundness for the well-being of humans, society, and the environment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.14009v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Research on affective visualization design has shown that color is an especially powerful feature for influencing the emotional connotation of visualizations. Associations between colors and emotions are largely driven by lightness (e.g., lighter colors are associated with positive emotions, whereas darker colors are associated with negative emotions). Designing visualizations to have all light or all dark colors to convey particular emotions may work well for visualizations in which colors represent categories and spatial channels encode data values. However, this approach poses a problem for visualizations that use color to represent spatial patterns in data (e.g., colormap data visualizations) because lightness contrast is needed to reveal fine details in spatial structure. In this study, we found it is possible to design colormaps that have strong lightness contrast to support spatial vision while communicating clear affective connotation. We also found that affective connotation depended not only on the color scales used to construct the colormaps, but also the frequency with which colors appeared in the map, as determined by the underlying dataset (data-dependence hypothesis). These results emphasize the importance of data-aware design, which accounts for not only the design features that encode data (e.g., colors, shapes, textures), but also how those design features are instantiated in a visualization, given the properties of the data.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.13979v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Here we ask how AI agent \"personalities\" interact with human personalities, and other traits, to shape human-AI collaboration, productivity and performance. To estimate these relationships, we conducted a large-scale preregistered randomized experiment that paired 1,258 participants with AI agents that were prompted to exhibit varying levels of the Big Five personality traits. These human-AI teams produced 7,266 display ads for a real think tank, and the quality of these ads was evaluated by 1,995 independent human raters as well as in a field experiment conducted on X, which generated nearly 5 million impressions. We found, first, that personality pairing impacted teamwork quality. For example, neurotic AI improved teamwork for agreeable humans but impaired it for conscientious humans. Second, we found productivity effects of personality pairing and a \"productivity-performance trade-off\" in which certain pairings (e.g., agreeable human with neurotic AI) produced fewer ads but of higher quality. Third, personality pairing influenced ad quality and performance. For example, quality improved when open humans were paired with conscientious AI and when conscientious humans were paired with disagreeable AI. Some of these pairing effects were \"jagged\" in that they varied across text and visual tasks. For example open humans produced higher quality images but lower quality text when paired with agreeable AI. Pairing effects were also present in other human traits, like country of origin. For example, extroverted AI improved quality for Latin American workers, but degraded quality for East Asian workers. These findings demonstrate that human-AI personality alignment significantly improves collaboration, productivity, and performance and lay a foundation for future research on improving human-AI collaboration through AI personalization.",

We aimed to develop a simple decision-making tool for identifying term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) based on features of conventional electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded within 6 hours of birth. Methods EEG recordings from 100 full-term neonates with HIE were graded by pediatric neurologists for severity. Amplitude in slow frequency bands was analyzed, focusing on delta (0.5-4 Hz) spectral power. Temporal fluctuations of delta power characterized each HIE grade, with joint level and duration probability densities estimated for delta oscillation power. This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gouv (NCT05114070). Results These 2D EEG representations effectively distinguish mild HIE cases from those requiring hypothermia, achieving 98% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 99% positive predictive value, 94% negative predictive value, an F1 score of 99%, and a false alarm rate of only 6%. This system accurately discriminates mild from moderate or severe HIE, with only one mild case mistakenly identified as requiring hypothermia and one moderate case erroneously flagged for treatment. Conclusions Quantized probability densities of delta spectral features from early EEG (within 6 hours of birth) revealed significant differences between mild and moderate/severe HIE, enabling accurate discrimination of candidates for TH. Significance Simple, interpretable biomarkers from early EEG can provide an efficient visual clinical decision support tool to identify full-term neonates with HIE eligible for therapeutic hypothermia.",

    "title": "THD-BAR: Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling for EEG Generic Representations",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.13733v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large-scale pre-trained models hold significant potential for learning universal EEG representations. However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a \"next-scale-time prediction\" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods. These results highlight the superior generalization and modeling capabilities of our proposed approach.",

Simulations confirmed dopamine facilitates movement via thalamic disinhibition. Analysis of its impact on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) revealed a complex, region-specific outcome: SNR increased in some regions (e.g., D2 Striatum: 3.41 dB to 6.25 dB), decreased in others (e.g., Thalamus VL: 6.24 dB to 3.93 dB), and remained stable elsewhere (e.g., M1: 3.16 dB to 3.13 dB). This heterogeneity stems from dopamine increasing the excitability of D1-receptor-expressing neurons, which amplifies channel conductance noise and reduces SNR in specific circuits. Thus, dopamine acts not as a uniform signal enhancer, but as a complex modulator that critically balances facilitation and noise within the CSTC loop.",

    "title": "Multi-network Topology Underlying Individual Language Learning Success",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.14453v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Adult language learning varies greatly among individuals. Traditionally associated with frontotemporal language regions, this variability is increasingly seen as stemming from distributed brain networks. However, the role of these networks and their topological organization in explaining these differences remains unclear. We hypothesize that graph-theory-based network analysis of intrinsic multimodal connectivities across multiple networks explains overall and component-specific variations in language learning. We tested this in 101 healthy adults who underwent resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging before seven days of six artificial language training tasks. We identified one dominant general learning component shared across tasks and five task-specific ones. Cross-validated predictive models used multimodal multi-network graph-theoretic metrics to predict final learning outcomes (LO) and rates (LR). We significantly predicted the LO and LR of the general component, which were primarily contributed by dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Nodal local efficiency was the most consistent predictor, with additional contributions from node clustering coefficient and network centrality for LR, highlighting local robustness, mesoscale network segregation, and global influence in explaining individual differences. Only task-specific word learning LO was predictable, relying on default mode and frontoparietal hubs with high betweenness centrality and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that intrinsic network topologies underlie differences in language learning success, supporting a multiple-systems hypothesis in which attentional-control networks interact with default and subcortical systems to shape learning trajectories. This advances mechanistic understanding and paves the way for personalized language education.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.14188v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Long COVID \"brain fog\" is a common and debilitating subjective syndrome often associated with persistent cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection. Here we identify a specific regional brain dysfunction that mediates this cognitive impairment and provide evidence that targeted neuromodulation improves this deficit. In 120 patients with long COVID brain fog, we found an aberrant perceptual processing pattern. Patients with more severe brain fog committed significantly more false alarms (impulsive responses to non-signals) despite preserved overall accuracy. Both high-density (128-channel) EEG and structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence of a right inferior insula deficit, characterized by a blunted neural monitoring signal and cortical atrophy. We confirmed this deficit in a separate 796-participant UK Biobank longitudinal COVID re-imaging cohort, where COVID-19 survivors also showed selective impairment on a perceptual processing task and corresponding longitudinal atrophy of the right inferior insula compared with healthy controls. Finally, in a proof-of-principle randomized, sham-controlled trial (n = 40), a non-invasive, excitatory theta-burst ultrasound stimulation protocol targeting the right inferior insula rescued the perceptual deficit by reducing false alarms. These findings provide evidence of a causal role for right inferior insula dysfunction in long COVID-related perceptual impairment and show that modulation of this region can rescue the deficit, establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for long COVID cognitive impairment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.14065v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The collective frequency that emerges from synchronized neuronal populations--the network resonance--shows a systematic relationship with brain size: whole-brain's large networks oscillate slowly, whereas finer parcellations of fixed volume exhibit faster rhythms. This resonance-size scaling has been reported in delayed neural mass models and human neuroimaging, yet the physical mechanism remained unresolved. Here we show that size-dependent resonance follows directly from propagation delays in delay-coupled phase oscillators. Starting from a Kuramoto model with heterogeneous delays, we linearize around the near-synchronous solution and obtain a closed-form approximation linking the resonance $\\Omega$ to the mean delay and the effective coupling field. The analysis predicts a generic scaling law: $\\Omega \\approx (\\sum_j c_{ij} \\tau)^{-1}$, so resonance is delay-limited and therefore depends systematically on geometric size or parcellation density. We evaluate four growth scenarios--expanding geometry, fixed-volume parcellation, constant geometry, and an unphysical reference case--and show that only geometry-consistent scaling satisfies the analytical prediction. Numerical simulations with heterogeneous delays validate the law and quantify its error as a function of delay dispersion. These results identify a minimal physical mechanism for size-dependent cortical resonance and provide an analytical framework that unifies numeric simulation outputs.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.13954v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human emotions are difficult to convey through words and are often abstracted in the process; however, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can offer a more direct lens into emotional brain activity. Recent studies show that deep learning models can process these signals to perform emotion recognition with high accuracy. However, many existing approaches overlook the dynamic interplay between distinct brain regions, which can be crucial to understanding how emotions unfold and evolve over time, potentially aiding in more accurate emotion recognition. To address this, we propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based neural network architecture that models inter-cortical neural dynamics of the brain in latent space to better capture structured neural interactions for effective EEG-based emotion recognition. First, the EEG signals are converted into Band Differential Entropy (BDE) tokens, which are then passed through Electrode Identity embeddings to retain spatial provenance. These tokens are processed through successive inter-cortical multi-head attention blocks that construct an electrode x electrode attention matrix, allowing the model to learn the inter-cortical neural dependencies. The resulting features are then passed through a classification head to obtain the final prediction. We conducted extensive experiments, specifically under subject-dependent settings, on the SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets, over all three dimensions, Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (for DEAP and DREAMER), under both binary and multi-class classification settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBTransformer outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets, over all three dimensions under both classification settings.

    "content": "arXiv:2511.13899v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Low-rank recurrent neural networks (lrRNNs) are a class of models that uncover low-dimensional latent dynamics underlying neural population activity. Although their functional connectivity is low-rank, it lacks disentanglement interpretations, making it difficult to assign distinct computational roles to different latent dimensions. To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions. Experiments on synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data show that DisRNN consistently improves the disentanglement and interpretability of learned neural latent trajectories in low-dimensional space and low-rank connectivity over baseline lrRNNs that do not encourage partial disentanglement.",

A cyclic inter subject training approach, involving shorter per subject training segments and frequent alternation among subjects, led to modest yet consistent improvements in decoding performance across unseen target data. Furthermore, under the subject calibrated leave one subject out scheme, incorporating only 10 % of the target subjects data for calibration achieved an accuracy of 0.781 and an AUC of 0.801, demonstrating the effectiveness of few shot adaptation.

    "content": "ObjectivesBy employing deep learning-based automatic whole-brain region segmentation technology, we aim to investigate the cross-sectional associations between regional brain volumes and disease duration in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).MethodsA retrospective study design was implemented on 83 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD who had complete clinical and imaging data. Cranial magnetic resonance images (MRI) were imported into the uAI platform for automated regional segmentation of brain tissue. Volumetric data from five major brain regions and 80 subregions were extracted to explore their potential associations with disease progression in PD patients. Statistical analysis was conducted using a multiple linear regression model within the framework of linear regression analysis, with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05.ResultsCross-sectional analysis revealed that in PD patients, volume ratios of multiple brain regions\u2014including the bilateral precentral gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral superior and inferior parietal lobules, bilateral precuneus, right cuneus, right lingual gyrus, bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, and right globus pallidus\u2014were negatively associated with disease duration (p < 0.05). In contrast, the right hippocampus, right inferior temporal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus showed positive correlations (p < 0.05). The combined volume ratios of these brain regions also decreased with longer disease duration (p < 0.05). Furthermore, absolute volume differences in the hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, and cerebellar white matter increased as the disease progressed (p < 0.05).ConclusionIn PD patients, volume ratios and absolute volume differences in specific brain subregions associated with lateralized intracranial changes may serve as potential biomarkers for assessing brain tissue alterations during disease progression.",

    "content": "IntroductionAutistic adults with speech, language and/or cognitive challenges are often excluded from research, particularly from studies examining first-person perspectives, as these generally require that participants have strong speech, language, and cognitive skills. The current pilot study extends previous work and examines whether the Autism Voices framework can be adapted for use with a pre-existing interview the Camberwell Assessment of Need for Adults with Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities-Research version (CANDID-R).MethodsEleven young autistic adults with complex communication needs completed the CANDID-R interview using visual supports. These visual supports were provided to assist participants\u2019 comprehension of interview questions and to support them in answering the interview questions. Participants\u2019 caregivers also completed the interview and their answers to specific validation questions were compared to those of their adult children. Additionally, behavioral observations were also completed.ResultsThe findings from this pilot study indicate that our adaptation of the Autism Voices framework was, at least partially successful in supporting participants in answering the interview questions. Additionally, behavioral observations indicate that the visual supports helped participants remain engaged throughout the interview. However, results also indicate that further adaptations, which we discuss, will be required.ConclusionAutistic people with complex communication needs must be included in research about the lived experiences of autistic people. Building on previous work, we show that, with dedication and imagination, equitable and inclusive research is possible.",

    "title": "Whole-Brain Millisecond-Scale Effective Connectivity Atlas of Auditory and Visual Naming",
    "content": "Neurobiological models suggest that speech relies on interactions among distant cortical regions interconnected by white matter pathways. Prior studies have shown that speech-related functional coactivation--simultaneous high-gamma augmentation across distributed regions--reflects underlying neural interactions, as validated by electrical stimulation mapping. However, it remains unclear at the whole-brain level when, for how long, and in which directions cortical regions transmit information, and how dynamic information flows contribute to speech. Here, we investigated the causal roles of directional neural information flow during auditory and visual naming using intracranial EEG from 9,526 artifact-free nonepileptic sites across 127 patients. Information flow, estimated by transfer entropy-based effective connectivity, was classified as excitatory when high-gamma acceleration in one region predicted subsequent acceleration in another, and inhibitory when deceleration predicted downstream deceleration. Following stimulus onset, excitatory flows emerged from modality-specific sensory cortices and propagated to higher-order regions, later becoming bidirectional as functional coactivation developed. Each excitatory flow event was transient (<500 ms), typically followed by inhibitory flows and decreased coactivation, during which excitatory flows often emerged along new pathways. During auditory naming, faster response times were associated with stronger excitatory flows in left perisylvian regions; during visual naming, faster responses were linked to stronger flows in bilateral basal temporal cortices. Stronger excitatory flows at specific time points predicted a higher probability of stimulation-induced symptoms (Spearman's rho: 0.54 - 0.81; p<0.00001), whereas associations with inhibitory flows peaked later. Excitatory flows near visual naming response onset were particularly associated with stimulation-induced speech arrest and face sensorimotor symptoms, whereas functional coactivation alone failed to reveal comparable associations. These findings demonstrate that transient acceleration of directional neural interactions through white matter supports successive stages of speech processing. As activity within one pathway decelerates, excitatory flow accelerates along another, enabling functional transitions critical for naming. By establishing the causal contribution of temporally precise, anatomically specific white matter pathways, this study substantiates and extends existing neurobiological models of speech. To facilitate replication and dynamic whole-brain visualization, we provide open access to the full dataset (62.15 GB) and analysis code.",

    "title": "Neural mechanisms of handedness for precision drawing: hand-dependent engagement of cortical networks for bimanual control and tool use",
    "content": "The neural mechanisms of handedness remain poorly understood, particularly for lateralized movements such as precision drawing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined how healthy adults and individuals with peripheral nerve injury (PNI) in their dominant hand performed a visually guided drawing task with each hand. We hypothesized that the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) supports drawing with either hand, and that individuals with PNI would recruit the same mechanisms as healthy adults. Methods: 33 Right-handed adults (23 healthy adults, 10 patients) underwent fMRI while performing a precision drawing task, alternating between the right hand (RH) and left hand (LH). LH>RH effects were examined across 20 regions of interest (12 a priori, 8 post hoc) using two approaches: (1) BOLD magnitude, and (2) functional connectivity (FC) modulation, assessed via generalized psychophysiological interaction. Results: All effects describe LH drawing > RH drawing. Right primary motor cortex (M1) had lower magnitude and greater FC with two networks, both of which exhibited equal-or-greater magnitude: a left hemisphere M1-dorsal premotor circuit, and an intrahemispheric parieto-temporal circuit. Right M1 (also had reduced interhemispheric FC with inferior parietal lobule, which exhibited lower magnitude. Patient group had no effect on magnitude or FC. Conclusions: Three neural mechanisms differentiate LH from RH drawing in right handed adults. First, a left hemisphere system for bimanual control, which engages intrahemispherically (directly) during RH drawing but interhemispherically (indirectly) during LH drawing. Second, LH drawing increases engagement of a contralateral system that may reflect increased task demands. Third, RH drawing increases engagement of an interhemispheric circuit for tool use. The first and third systems may explain performance asymmetries associated with handedness. Patients with PNI use the same mechanisms as healthy adults, highlighting these mechanisms' potential as a neuromodulatory target to enhance LH performance after RH impairment.",

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "Neural Dynamics of Multiattribute Decision Making Under Choice Overload",
    "content": "The present study examines the neural mechanisms of value-based multiattribute decision making through the lens of choice overload during consumer choice. Two behavioral experiments established that choice sets of a moderate size with nine options were perceived as most optimal compared to choice sets with three and 24 options, and options chosen from the largest set size were judged to be the least satisfying. A functional MRI study then examined how the brain responds to choice sets varying in size and complexity by manipulating the number of options presented as well as the presence of asymmetrically dominated decoy alternatives during a simulated online shopping task. Results showed that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity followed an inverse U-shape as a function of choice set size, peaking for moderately sized choice sets. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) exhibited a linear trend with choice set size. Trials containing decoy options elicited greater activation of the anterior insula (AIns) and DLPFC. Computational modeling of choice behavior revealed a greater tendency to utilize a simplifying lexicographic decision strategy as decision difficulty increased, and individual differences in decision strategies were reflected in activity of the ACC and AIns. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates effort, control, and strategy during complex value-based decisions.",

    "title": "CUSP: Complex Spike Sorting from Multi-electrode Array Recordings with U-net Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction",
    "content": "Background: Complex spikes (CSs) in cerebellar Purkinje cells convey unique signals complementary to Simple spike (SS) action potentials, but are infrequent and variable in waveform. Their variability and low spike counts, combined with recording artifacts such as electrode drift, make automated detection challenging. New Method: We introduce CUSP (CS sorting via U-net Sequence Prediction), a fully automated deep learning framework for CS sorting in high-density multi-electrode array recordings. CUSP uses a U-Net architecture with hybrid self-attention inception blocks to integrate local field potential and action potential signals and outputs CS event probabilities in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Detected events are clustered and paired with concurrently detected SSs to reconstruct the complete Purkinje cell activity. Results: Trained on cerebellar neuropixels recordings in rhesus macaques, CUSP achieves human-expert performance (F1 = 0.83 +/- 0.03) and even captures valid CS events overlooked during manual annotation. Comparison with Existing Methods: CUSP outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art CS and SS sorting algorithms on CS detection. It remains robust to waveform variability, spikelet composition, and electrode drift, enabling accurate CS tracking in long-term recordings. In contrast, existing methods often show false-positive biases or degrade under drift. Conclusions: CUSP provides a scalable, robust framework for analyzing burst-like or dynamically complex spike patterns. Its generalizability makes it valuable for large-scale cerebellar datasets and other neural systems, such as hippocampal pyramidal cells, where complex bursts are critical for computation. By combining expert-level accuracy with automation, CUSP offers a broadly applicable solution for studying information coding across circuits.",

    "title": "A dopamine circuit regulates locomotor initiation and persistence in Drosophila",
    "content": "Decisions to initiate or terminate locomotion reflect the commitment of an animal to expend energy and thus must be appropriately regulated. Dopaminergic system has been implicated in locomotor regulation but how it controls these decisions remains unclear. Here we show that a dopamine circuit in Drosophila mushroom body regulates cue-induced locomotor initiation and termination by integrating locomotor history and current motivation. This circuit consists of the locomotor-initiator mushroom body output neurons, MBON09, and the locomotor-terminator MBON21. Previous locomotor initiation by default suppresses the propensity of future initiation through depression of MBON09 activity by locomotion-sensitive dopamine afferents, preventing redundant action. Locomotor persistence is promoted through combined inhibition of MBON21 by MBON09 and by distinct dopamine afferents that receive fluctuating motivational signals. Persistent locomotion under high motivational state, in turn, causes dopamine-dependent MBON09 facilitation, reinvigorating locomotor initiation program. Our results revealed a dopaminergic mechanism to transform recent behavior and current motivation into a moment-by-moment internal state that in turn regulates locomotor decisions.",

    "title": "Separable neurocomputational mechanisms underlying multisensory learning",
    "content": "Efficient control of behavior requires multisensory learning from information distributed across senses. However, most neurocomputational studies have focused on unisensory signals. Here, we identify distinct but interacting neurocomputational mechanisms that support learning of multisensory associations. We designed a task in which behaviorally relevant information was available only from combinations of visual cues with either auditory or tactile cues. In 58 participants undergoing fMRI, we dissociated three processes: multisensory statistical learning (SL), modeled as stimulus-locked Shannon surprise; reinforcement learning (RL), modeled as feedback-locked signed reward prediction errors (RPEs); and feedback-locked unsigned RPEs (uRPEs), reflecting surprise about reward outcomes. Behaviorally, response times scaled with Shannon surprise (SL) while accuracy improved with feedback (RL). Model-based fMRI revealed dissociable but complementary networks: RPEs engaged ventral striatum, vmPFC, and left angular gyrus; surprise recruited bilateral angular gyrus, dlPFC, and precuneus; and uRPEs involved insula, dorsomedial prefrontal, and lateral frontoparietal cortices. Several of these regions are not typically implicated in unisensory studies, suggesting specialization for multisensory learning. All three networks were modality-general, i.e., they showed comparable strength for audiovisual and visuotactile learning. Notably, left angular gyrus tracked both Shannon surprise and RPE, identifying it as a potential hub for integrating structural and value information. These findings reveal that the brain engages distinct but complementary systems for structure-based, reward-based, and outcome-surprise computations. By combining behavioral modeling and fMRI with a novel task design, we provide a principled framework for dissecting the neurocomputational architecture of multisensory learning.",

    "title": "Sex Differences in B2 SINE RNA Expression and its Role in Hippocampal Development",
    "content": "Once dismissed as \"junk\", transposable elements (TE) have recently gained recognition for their regulatory roles, notably in the brain and in development. The brain is hormone-responsive and the hippocampus in particular is sensitive to circulating gonadal hormones. While transcriptionally active, TE function remains poorly understood, especially in the brain. We and others have shown that one particular TE RNA, B2 SINE ncRNA, is a regulator in the rodent hippocampus, especially after a psychologically stressful event like acute restraint stress. It is unknown, however, if B2 SINE ncRNA is necessary for the proper development of hippocampal neurons, and furthermore, if there is a sex difference in this development. This work investigates the difference in expression of B2 SINE RNA across sexes and its role in the development of primary hippocampal neurons. We utilized pooled locked nucleic acid (LNA) GapmeRs to knock down the expression of B2 SINE RNA and treated primary hippocampal neurons with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to test if there is a difference in dendritic complexity. We used Sholl analysis to quantify the branching, number of tips, and Sholl mean. We found a sex difference in both B2 SINE, higher in males compared to females, and B-actin, lower in males compared to females. Additionally, knocking down B2 SINE RNA results in a reduction of dendritic complexity in male but not in female neurons. Taken together, this work suggests that B2 SINE RNA is expressed differentially and plays an important role in the proper development of hippocampal neurons in a sex dependent manner. Our findings support the identification of a sex-specific biomarker that may enable individualized treatment of conditions influenced by sex. This is the first evidence of the role a transposable element's RNA has in the regulation of the development of neurons and the first to show that differential regulation by sex.",

    "content": "The diversity of motor units arises from differences in the contractile properties of muscle fibers and the intrinsic electrical properties of their motoneurons. In mice, however, this relationship has not been quantitatively defined, and conventional classification often relies on subjective thresholds. Here, we combined in vivo intracellular recordings with supervised and unsupervised machine-learning methods to test whether motoneuron electrophysiology can predict the physiological identity of mouse motor units. Unbiased clustering identified four groups corresponding to slow (S), fast fatigue-resistant (FR), intermediate (FI), and fast fatigable (FF) types. A multinomial logistic regression model performed well, with most errors occurring between FI and FF types, which showed substantial overlap. Reducing the task to three classes improved accuracy. Feature selection revealed that four electrophysiological properties (input conductance, rheobase, AHP duration, maximal frequency) were sufficient for high predictive performance. Overall, this study provides a quantitative description of mouse motor-unit properties and a framework for incorporating motor-unit diversity into future investigations of neuromuscular physiology and disease.",

    "title": "Perceiving Instability: How Expectations Bias Sensorimotor Processing in Balance Control",
    "content": "Maintaining balance requires rapid integration of sensory input with top-down sensorimotor predictions. Predictive coding frameworks posit that mismatches between the two (prediction errors) drive perceptual inference. Although these frameworks have helped explain perception in unisensory domains (e.g., vision, touch), it remains unclear whether such mechanisms govern perception in fast-acting sensorimotor systems like human balance. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and discrete postural perturbations, we independently manipulated expectations and sensory input by priming healthy adult participants to expect either small or large perturbations, while occasionally delivering expectancy-violating perturbations (i.e., perturbations were smaller or larger than expected). Subjective perception of instability was shaped by expectation alone, regardless of actual sensory input (i.e., perturbation magnitude). Similarly, both anticipatory pre-perturbation beta-band suppression and post-perturbation sensorimotor gamma increases were sensitive to expected perturbation magnitude. In contrast, both the balance N1 (a well-established stimulus-evoked cortical potential) and the objective postural responses of instability tracked actual perturbation magnitude alone. Crucially, neither perception, nor any of these early (commonly analysed) neural or behavioural markers, encoded prediction errors. These findings suggest that two distinct systems exist: one that is sensitive to top-down expectations and another that is driven by sensory input, independent of expectation or mismatches. These findings challenge the centrality of prediction error as a driver of perception in fast sensorimotor systems such as postural control, and offer insight into conditions marked by distorted bodily awareness during balance.",

    "title": "Auditory Cortical Gradients Integrate Bottom-Up and Top-Down Structure During Natural Sound Categorisation",
    "content": "Understanding how the brain organises natural categories is a central challenge in neuroscience. While prior work has shown that categories can be decoded from distributed activity patterns in auditory cortex, it remains unclear how these categories are globally arranged relative to one another, and how low-level acoustic and higher-level semantic structure jointly shape this organisation. Here, we addressed these questions by deriving low-dimensional functional gradients from high-depth functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (three participants, ~4.7 hours each) acquired during a category-specific one-back task. These gradients captured the principal axes of population activity in auditory cortex. Gradient-based models of the auditory cortex explained category structure more accurately than region-of-interest or whole-brain approaches, revealing that category information is distributed across multiple continuous axes rather than aligned with any single organisational dimension. Projecting acoustic (gammatone filter-bank) and behavioural similarity spaces directly into a shared framework with the fMRI functional axes showed that both contribute to the brain's category geometry, with acoustic structure exerting a somewhat stronger influence. However, representational relationships varied across category pairs: some reflected primarily acoustic similarity, others semantic distinctions, and many a combination of both. This pairwise heterogeneity shows how auditory cortex may integrate multiple representational dimensions that define higher-level categories.",

    "content": "How astrocytes achieve their diverse roles in the brain at the molecular level is poorly understood. In this study, we leverage mouse models, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, behavioral assays, and bioinformatic approaches to demonstrate that astrocyte activity and astrocyte-mediated mouse behavior depends on the highly conserved and selective RNA turnover pathway-nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD). Conditional deletion of the core NMD gene, Upf2, in mature astrocytes leads to enhanced basal Ca2+ signaling coupled with synapse dysfunction and elevated anxiety. Restoring basal Ca2+ signaling in NMD-deficient astrocytes rescued synaptic transmission and minimized anxiety-associated behavior. Molecular bioinformatic analysis identified specific NMD target transcripts in astrocytes as candidates influencing calcium signaling pathways and neuro-glia interactions that support brain function. Our study is the first to demonstrate functional roles for NMD in astrocytes.",

    "content": "Neuronal metabolism is fundamental to brain functions and diseases, yet its spatial and temporal dynamics and interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce a tandem deep-learning approach integrated with bioorthogonal chemical imaging using stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. This method achieves high-speed and quantitative metabolic profiling in live neuronal co-cultures. Our deep-learning framework consists of a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) that enables high-resolution 3D imaging with minimal photodamage and a U-Net segmentation model for cell-type-specific metabolic analysis. Using deuterium-labeled metabolites, we demonstrate the ability to trace lipid, protein, glucose, and D2O metabolism in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes under physiological and pathological conditions, including NMDA receptor activation, proteasome inhibition, and Huntington's disease. Our findings reveal distinct metabolic adaptations among neuronal cell types and underscore the importance of non-invasive metabolic profiling for understanding neuronal interactions and disease mechanisms. This platform significantly advances live-cell dynamic imaging with broad applications in neuroscience, disease modeling, and therapeutic screening.",

    "title": "Cell-autonomous mitochondrial calcium flux governs oligodendrocyte regeneration",
    "content": "Oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells drive central nervous system remyelination, yet the intrinsic mechanisms that define their regenerative potential remain unclear. We identify spontaneous, cell-autonomous intracellular Ca2+ signaling as a critical mechanism regulating OL regeneration following demyelination. Longitudinal in vivo imaging and ex vivo recordings reveal that Ca2+ signaling arises intrinsically within OL lineage cells after demyelination, and occurs independently from neuronal or behavioral activity. Mechanistically, mitochondrial Ca2+ flux sustains intracellular Ca2+ signals in oligodendroglia, and its in vivo disruption impairs oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation, differentiation, and repopulation at the lesion site. Conversely, enhancing oligodendroglial Ca2+ signaling in vivo using chemogenetics stimulates lineage expansion and differentiation. In primary human OPC cultures, modulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ flux similarly reduces proliferation, indicating a conserved role for this pathway across species. These findings identify mitochondrial Ca2+ flux as a central driver of the oligodendroglial regeneration and a potential therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases.",

    "content": "Dendrite regeneration is critical for restoring neuronal connectivity after injury, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using C. elegans as a model and through a forward genetic screen, we identified the conserved insulin degrading enzyme idr-1 and the RNA-binding protein rbm-42 as key regulators of dendrite regeneration, where idr-1 functions upstream of rbm-42. We further show that ced-7, one of the core components of the phagocytosis pathway, acting downstream of rbm-42, while other components of this pathway don't play significant roles in dendrite regeneration. In addition, we demonstrate that upon injury IDR-1 can promote RBM-42 nuclear export following injury, enabling its dendritic localization. RBM-42, in turn, promotes the translation of ced-7 and facilitates microtubule assembly. In conclusion, our findings define a novel conserved signaling cascade coupling injury-induced nuclear export of RNA binding proteins to local regulation and dendrite regeneration, providing new mechanistic insight into neuronal repair.",

    "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

    "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
    "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

    "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
    "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

    "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
    "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

    "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
    "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

    "content": "Parkinsons disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, is characterised by pervasive deposition of alpha-synuclein (-Syn) aggregates and the death of dopaminergic neurons. Fc gamma receptor IIb (Fc{gamma}RIIb or CD32b), the sole inhibitory Fc{gamma}R in humans (h) and mice (m), serves as a molecular conduit for intercellular -Syn transmission in-vitro. Here, we demonstrate that Fc{gamma}RIIb facilitates -Syn propagation and neurotoxicity in-vivo using the pre-formed fibril (PFF) -Syn model in mice. Genetic ablation of mFc{gamma}RII attenuated PFF -Syn-induced Lewy pathology, dampened associated neuroinflammatory responses, and preserved nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of hFc{gamma}RIIb using clinically-related monoclonal antibodies mitigated acute-phase -Syn pathology in hFc{gamma}RIIb-transgenic mice following PFF challenge. Collectively, our results indicate that Fc{gamma}RIIb is a mediator of -Syn propagation in-vivo and highlight it as a tractable therapeutic target against -synucleinopathies like PD.",

    "title": "Local differences in baseline sodium shape astrocytic potassium uptake by the NKA",
    "content": "Astrocytes are vital for the maintenance of ion and transmitter homeostasis in the extracellular space, with the inward Na gradient playing a pivotal role in these processes. Earlier studies not only reported a low baseline Na+ concentration ([Na+]) in astrocytes, but also suggested an equilibration of [Na+] within the gap-junction-coupled syncytium. This is consistent with the view that the basic homeostatic properties of astrocytes are largely identical due to their critical role in brain function. Here, we used multi-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging for a quantitative determination of astrocytic [Na+] in mouse forebrain tissue slices and in vivo. Contrary to the prevailing notion of a rather uniform Na distribution, we detected a previously unobserved subcellular and cellular heterogeneity in astrocytic [Na+], accompanied by differences in the capacity for Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA)-mediated uptake of extracellular K+. Biophysical modelling showed that this heterogeneity can be replicated by the reported differential expression of NKA isoforms in astrocytes together with a different strength of Na+ influx over the plasma membranes. Altogether, our results thus suggest the existence of functionally distinct astrocytes and astrocyte subdomains in which Na+ homeostasis is locally adapted to the specific requirements of surrounding neural networks.",

    "title": "A painless nerve growth factor variant uncouples nociceptive and neurotrophic TrkA signaling",
    "content": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) binding to the receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA, drives neurotrophic signaling essential for neuronal development and survival. This interaction simultaneously drives peripheral pain, making this pathway an attractive but complicated therapeutic target for chronic pain. By integrating single-molecule microscopy, structural and electrophysiology analyses, with a human NGF variant, NGFpainless, which retains neurotrophic effects but abolishes pain, we delineate the molecular mechanisms that bias TrkA signaling towards neurotrophic functions without triggering nociception. We show that, unlike wild-type NGF, NGFpainless fails to sensitize TRPV1 channels to capsaicin, thus disengaging TrkA from the nociceptive pathway. We further show that this selective loss of nociceptive TrkA signaling by NGFpainless results from its reduced ability to activate PLC{gamma}1 and trigger calcium release compared to NGF, while still preserving the ERK and AKT signaling essential for neurotrophic functions. This biased signaling arises from reduced electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless complex interface, which shortens the lifetime of this functional complex on native membranes. Mutations in TrkA that restore the electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless interface eliminate biased signaling. This mechanistic understanding of TrkA binding by NGFpainless, and how it differs from NGF, will spur the development of two therapeutic classes of molecules - one that selectively suppresses nociceptive signaling while preserving neurotrophic functions in chronic pain, and another that enhances neurotrophic activity without evoking peripheral pain in neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "title": "Nrg1 regulates cortical wiring and motor recovery upon traumatic injury",
    "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability, yet molecular mechanisms supporting cortical repair remain poorly defined. While Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) is essential for cortical development, its role in traumatic cortical injury in adults is unclear. To circumvent developmental confounds, we used an inducible conditional Nrg1 knockout in the adult mouse and subjected it to controlled cortical damage (CCD) in the motor cortex. We combined high-resolution adeno-associated viral tracing of callosal projections with comprehensive behavioral, histological, and molecular analyses. Nrg1 deletion led to significant impairments in structural connectivity and long-term motor recovery, which were markedly exacerbated in aged mice, indicating a critical role for Nrg1 in adult cortical repair. Mechanistically, our data indicated that Nrg1 promoted this plasticity through its intracellular domain (ICD) signaling, acting cell-autonomously to enhance axonal outgrowth. Furthermore, loss of Nrg1 was associated with altered structure of perineuronal-nets (PNN) and increased neuroinflammation at the lesion site. Our findings identify endogenous Nrg1 as a key regulator of structural preservation and functional recovery, highlighting the Nrg1 signaling as a potential target to enhance cortical plasticity after trauma.",

CRISPR/Cas9 excision of the AAGGG repeat and flanking AluSx3 element normalized RFC1 expression in iPSC neurons and rescued the DNA damage response, providing a framework for future therapeutic strategies.

    "title": "DNMT1 Coordinates PV Interneuron-Glia Coupling to Maintain Cortical Network Stability and Regulate Behavior",
    "content": "Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are central to cortical network stability and psychiatric vulnerability. Here, we identify DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) as a key epigenetic regulator linking PV interneuron function to glial and extracellular matrix remodeling. Conditional PV-specific Dnmt1 deletion combined with single-cell RNA-seq, in vivo electrophysiology, histology, and behavioral analyses revealed that loss of DNMT1 increases PV spiking activity but reduces inhibitory efficacy, leading to network desynchronization and depression- and anxiety-like behavior in mice. These physiological alterations were accompanied by broad, non-cell-autonomous transcriptional changes in astrocytes and oligodendroglial populations, prominently affecting pathways involved in perineuronal-net (PNN) organization and neuron-glia communication. Cell-cell interaction analyses revealed disrupted NRXN-NLGN, TNR-integrin, and semaphoring signaling, consistent with weakened perisomatic adhesion and PNN integrity. Together, our findings demonstrate that DNMT1 maintains inhibitory circuit stability through cell-autonomous regulation of PV interneuron function, which secondarily shapes glial transcriptional states and extracellular scaffolds to preserve cortical network synchronization and emotional behavior.",

    "title": "Opioid receptor distribution in the claustrum-dorsal endopiriform complex",
    "content": "The claustrum and dorsal endopiriform regions form a thin subcortical sheet reciprocally connected to the neocortex that is enriched in opioid receptors. The precise cellular distribution of opioid receptors within this region remains unclear. Using multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) and hierarchical cluster analysis, we mapped the expression of mu (Oprm), delta (Oprd), kappa (Oprk), and ORL1 (Oprl) opioid receptor genes at single-cell resolution in the mouse claustrum-dorsal endopiriform. Among 2,269 neurons analyzed, six transcriptional clusters were identified: three excitatory (CLA, CLA/OPRK, cortical excitatory) and three inhibitory (SST, PVALB, broad inhibitory). Oprk expression was uniquely restricted to excitatory claustrum neurons and particularly enriched in the CLA/OPRK cluster which was comprised largely of Synpr+ claustrum core projection cells. In contrast, Oprd, Oprm, and Oprl genes were more broadly distributed across both excitatory and inhibitory populations, with Oprd enriched in parvalbumin (Pvalb) inhibitory neurons and Oprl in somatostatin (Sst) inhibitory neurons. Spatial mapping confirmed that Oprk expressing cells were concentrated within the claustrum core, whereas other receptor subtypes extended across the entire claustrum and into adjacent cortical regions. A comparable distribution of opioid receptors was observed in the neighbouring dorsal endopiriform. Analysis of a publicly available single cell sequencing dataset of the macaque claustrum also revealed a similar receptor distribution, where Oprk expression was enriched within a subset of excitatory projection neurons, and Oprm,Oprd, and Oprl expressed widely in both inhibitory and excitatory cells. Together, these findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved, cell-type-specific organization of opioid receptor expression in the claustrum-dorsal endopiriform. These results indicate that kappa opioid receptor expression is a defining molecular feature of excitatory claustrum projection neurons and suggest distinct roles for other opioid receptors in modulating inhibitory and cortical circuits.",

    "title": "Scopolamine induced learning deficit in marmosets",
    "content": "In monkeys, the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine is known to broadly disrupt learned behaviors, though the precise nature of the cognitive deficits has been questioned. Experimentally observable deficits in memory can be ascribed to poor attentional focusing, human interference as well as age, sex, and dosing regimen. Stress and social isolation can also play a role during behavioral testing, particularly in small nonhuman social primates like marmosets that have been used widely. In this study, we examine the effects of scopolamine in marmosets under conditions of reduced stress, attentional distraction, and human interference. Using a custom designed home-cage touchscreen-based testing system, we investigated the influence of scopolamine on the performance on a visual associative learning task. During self-paced, voluntary testing, monkeys learned to discriminate pairs of complex visual patterns through trial and error by touching the stimulus associated with reward. Using this approach, we demonstrated over 75% discrimination accuracy in the eight marmosets tested (male and female) within three days of home-cage testing. Although the averaged data revealed no impact of acute or chronic scopolamine injections on learning, modeling the choice data with trial-level analysis revealed both age- and sex-specific deficits. The results demonstrate the value of home-cage testing combined with trial-level analysis to reveal subtle behavioral changes, such as those brought about by scopolamine.",

    "content": "Personalized brain modeling at clinically relevant scales requires integrating biophysical models with empirical neuroimaging data, yet high-dimensional parameter estimation in whole-brain network models remains computationally prohibitive. We present TVB-Optim, an open-source Python library providing a general and extensible framework for gradient-based optimization of brain network models build on JAX. Leveraging automatic differentiation, we demonstrate direct optimization of thousands of parameters, from global coupling (N=2) to regional dynamics (N=168) to full structural connectivity matrices (N=14,028), across functional MRI and magnetoencephalography data. Forward simulations achieve 10x CPU speedup over reference implementations and scale efficiently to GPU and multi-device configurations. We establish best practices through documented workflows that combine coarse parameter space exploration with gradient refinement, often yielding superior solutions faster than gradient methods alone. By bridging mechanistic neuroscience with modern machine learning infrastructure, TVB-Optim enables large-scale personalized brain models, bringing computational neuroscience closer to clinical translation.",

    "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD), yet the early molecular events linking the two remain unclear. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a hallmark of AD, are observed in individuals with a history of single or repetitive head injury. Animal studies show that tau oligomers, the toxic species preceding the NFTs, appear shortly after TBI, but corresponding human data are lacking. Here, we investigated tau changes in the brains of individuals who died shortly after TBI compared to those surviving long-term. We report abnormal tau oligomers in the brain of short-term survivors whereas NFTs were the main feature in long-term survivors. These findings support a model where TBI triggers early tau oligomers formation that spread through a prion-like mechanism, seeding tau pathology and contributing to late-onset AD. The novel identification of tau oligomers in acute TBI reveals potential early disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets for AD prevention.",

    "title": "Data-driven identification of functional networks in artificial and biological neural networks",
    "content": "Understanding how the brain represents information is a central challenge in neuroscience and a practical bottleneck for brain-computer interfaces. Existing analytical tools cannot identify neural representations directly from neural activity data. We introduce MultiPEC, a data-driven method that discovers neural representations by quantifying how sets of signals jointly reduce context prediction error. Applied to artificial neural networks, MultiPEC uncovered class-specific subnetworks whose targeted ablation disproportionately impaired performance, demonstrating their causal role in feature recognition. Applied to EEG recordings from 24 participants, MultiPEC revealed functional signatures of auditory and visual processing. Classification analyses showed that MultiPEC captured fine-grained stimulus submodalities (levels of stimulus meaningfulness) more effectively than broad stimulus domains, highlighting the context-sensitive nature of neural representations. Together, these results establish MultiPEC as a scalable approach for identifying data driven (natural) representations in both biological and artificial systems, with potential applications in adaptive neurotechnology, clinical diagnostics and cognitive neuroscience.",

    "content": "Brain vasculature is essential for central nervous system function, but its specific roles in synaptic development and motor function regulation are poorly understood. In this study, we identify a cerebrovascular signaling axis wherein endothelial PRMT5 critically regulates inhibitory synaptogenesis and motor coordination. Cerebrovascular-speci[fi]c deletion of Prmt5 gene leads to excessive inhibitory synaptic input onto Purkinje cells and progressive motor deficits in mice. Mechanistically, PRMT5 deficiency epigenetically upregulates the expression of the secreted factor ANGPTL4 through reduced symmetric dimethylation of H3R8 and H4R3, along with increased H3K9 acetylation at the Angptl4 promoter, thereby driving excessive inhibitory synaptogenesis onto Purkinje cells. Importantly, Angptl4 deletion in brain endothelium normalizes inhibitory synaptic input onto Purkinje cells and restores motor coordination in PRMT5-deficient mice. Together, these findings define the endothelial PRMT5-ANGPTL4 axis as a key regulator of cerebellar inhibitory circuitry and motor function, highlighting cerebrovascular mechanisms as potential therapeutic targets for motor coordination disorders.",

    "title": "Prenatal valproic acid-exposed autism marmosets increase mutual gaze and reduce inter-individual distance during dyadic social interactions",
    "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in social interaction. While most assessments of ASD remain individual-centric, dyad-level evaluation may reveal features not apparent in individual profiling. We examined dyadic coordination in a non-human primate ASD model under experimentally controlled yet naturalistic conditions. Markerless pose estimation was used to quantify frame-by-frame gaze behavior and inter-individual distance during first encounters between unfamiliar common marmosets. Dyads with a prenatal valproic acid-exposed animal and an unexposed partner (VPA-UE) were compared with unexposed controls (UE-UE). VPA-UE pairs showed a higher proportion and greater number of mutual gaze episodes, whereas overall gaze shift was similar across groups. VPA marmosets made fewer unreciprocated looks; however, when the partner looked at them, they more often returned the look within 1 s, indicating heightened gaze reactivity. VPA-UE dyads maintained shorter inter-individual distances, and the closer proximity destabilized mutual gaze more strongly than in UE-UE dyads. These findings indicate a distinct dyadic-coordination pattern in VPA-UE pairs: rapid responsiveness combined with reduced tolerance for close spacing, consistent with distance-dependent differences rather than a global deficit in social motivation. This dyad-centric markerless framework provides scalable, ecologically grounded measures and intervention targets that leverage intact responsiveness while accommodating altered spatial coordination.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN!<p>Claude Code is great, but it\u2019s focused on coding. The missing piece is a native way to build and run custom background agents for non-code tasks. We built RowboatX as a CLI tool modeled after Claude Code that lets you do that. It uses the file system and unix tools to create and monitor background agents for everyday tasks, connect them to any MCP server for tools, and reason over their outputs.<p>Because RowboatX runs locally with shell access, the agents can install tools, execute code, and automate anything you could do in a terminal with your explicit permission. It works with any compatible LLM, including open-source ones.<p>Our repo is <a href=\"https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat</a>, and there\u2019s a demo video here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cyPBinQzicY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/cyPBinQzicY</a><p>For example, you can connect RowboatX to the ElevenLabs MCP server and create a background workflow that produces a NotebookLM-style podcast every day from recent AI-agent papers on arXiv. Or you can connect it to Google Calendar and Exa Search to research meeting attendees and generate briefs before each event.<p>You can try these with: `npx @rowboatlabs/rowboatx`<p>We combined three simple ideas:<p>1. File system as state: Each agent\u2019s instruction, memory, logs, and data are just files on disk, grepable, diffable, and local. For instance, you can just run: grep -rl '\"agent\":\"\"' ~/.rowboat/runs to list every run for a particular workflow.<p>2. The supervisor agent: A Claude Code style agent that can create and run background agents. It predominantly uses Unix commands to monitor, update, and schedule agents. LLMs handle Unix tools better than backend APIs [1][2], so we leaned into that. It can also probe any MCP server and attach the tools to the agents.<p>3. Human-in-the-loop: Each background agent can emit a human_request message when needed (e.g. drafting a tricky email or installing a tool) that pauses execution and waits for input before continuing. The supervisor coordinates this.<p>I started my career over a decade ago building spam detection models at Twitter, spending a lot of my time in the terminal with Unix commands for data analysis [0] and Vowpal Wabbit for modeling. When Claude Code came along, it felt familiar and amazing to work with. But trying to use it beyond code always felt a bit forced. We built RowboatX to bring that same workflow to everyday tasks. It is Apache-2.0 licensed and easily extendable.<p>While there are many agent builders, running on the user's terminal enables unique use cases like computer and browser automation that cloud-based tools can't match. This power requires careful safety design. We implemented command-level allow/deny lists, with containerization coming next. We\u2019ve tried to design for safety from day one, but we\u2019d love to hear the community\u2019s perspective on what additional safeguards or approaches you\u2019d consider important here.<p>We\u2019re excited to share RowboatX with everyone here. We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and welcome contributions!<p>\u2014<p>[0] <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/kwc-unix-for-poets.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/kwc-unix-for-poets.pdf</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06807\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06807</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10132\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10132</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45970338\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45970338</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Cognitive and brain function enhancement in Gen X group after personalized, AI supervised EEG-neurofeedback training",
    "content": "Background: Interventions supporting medical care and enhancing quality of life in neurodegenerative or age-related cognitive decline are strongly needed. Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback can enable users to modulate their brain activity through real-time feedback. However, evidence for its clinical effectiveness remains inconclusive, partly due to limited personalization and insufficient task relevance in existing protocols. Objective: We tested whether personalized EEG neurofeedback supervised by deep neural networks (DNNs) can enhance cognitive performance in older adults. Methods: Fifty-seven healthy adults aged 41 to 64 (31 women), including a sham-feedback control group, completed a personalized neurofeedback protocol with DNNs fine-tuned to individual EEG patterns. The procedure included pre- and post-training assessments using a transitive reasoning task, three diagnostic sessions to adapt the DNN to each participant, and 10 neurofeedback sessions based on a gamified delayed-match-to-sample paradigm. Results: The training group showed robust gains across all three variants of the reasoning task (each p < .01), whereas the sham group improved only on the easiest variant. Groups did not differ at pretest; however, at posttest the training group outperformed the sham group on all task conditions (each p < .03), showing also a larger neural effort (lower alpha band power) and increased beta and gamma band connectivity (higher phase lag index). Conclusion: Personalized, task-oriented neurofeedback guided by individually fine-tuned DNNs can produce cognitive enhancement after relatively few sessions. The proposed Task-Pretrained, Subject-Finetuned Neurofeedback (TPSF-NF) framework is scalable to other cognitive domains in future research.",

    "title": "Chronic cervical vibration ameliorates depression-like behavior in Wistar-Kyoto rats",
    "content": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric condition, and a substantial proportion of patients exhibit inadequate responses to conventional pharmacotherapy. Somatosensory processing abnormalities and altered thalamo-cortical connectivity have been implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, raising the possibility that targeted somatosensory stimulation may modulate affective circuits. Here, we examined whether chronic cervical vibration improves depression-like behaviors in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, a well-established model of treatment-resistant depression. Rats received repeated vibration stimulation applied to the cervical region. Behavioral effects were evaluated using the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and the forced swim test (FST). Swimming activity was quantified during the late-phase of the FST to exclude early panic-like behavior. Immunohistochemistry for c-Fos was performed in the dorsal raphe (DR), lateral habenula (LHb), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Vibration-treated rats showed significantly shorter feeding latencies in the NSFT and significantly increased swimming distance during the analysis period of the FST. No significant group differences in c-Fos expression were observed in DR, LHb, PVN, or PFC. These findings indicate that chronic cervical vibration produces reproducible improvements in depressive-like behavior in WKY rats. Because c-Fos activity remained unchanged, the behavioral effects may reflect gradual changes in broader network processing rather than acute activation of monoaminergic or habenular-prefrontal pathways. Cervical vibration represents a simple, non-invasive sensory intervention with translational potential. Additional mechanistic studies are warranted.",

    "title": "Modeling Psychophysical Data in R: A Comparative Study of Four Model Frameworks",
    "content": "Inferential models in psychophysics are essential for quantifying the relation between physical properties of the stimulus and their perceptual representations. The psychometric function is typically used to model the responses of individual participants in forced-choice experiments. The accuracy and the noise of the response can be estimated from the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) and the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) of the function, respectively. Traditionally, a two-level approach is used to model the behavior of a group of participants, where psychometric functions are first fitted to individual participant data, followed by hypothesis testing across participants on parameters of interest. Recent studies have introduced alternative approaches based on hierarchical models, such as Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Models within the Bayesian Hierarchical Framework (BHF), to analyze in a single framework the responses from multiple participants. These two approaches can be effectively implemented in R, thanks to its flexibility and robust statistical capabilities. Here, we provide a tutorial on how to model and analyze data from psychophysical experiments in R, using both two-level and hierarchical frameworks. Our goal is to provide researchers with a practical guide for building a complete and reproducible analysis pipeline, using core R functionalities together with custom packages, and facilitate rigorous and efficient data analysis in psychophysics.",

    "title": "Anxious vision: Trait-like visual cortical hyperactivity in trait anxiety",
    "content": "Sensory processing varies across individuals, often manifesting as distinct traits. Some traits, particularly sensory hypersensitivity, even to basic non-valenced stimuli, are closely linked to emotional traits and implicated in a diversity of psychiatric disorders. Extant theories attribute this sensory-emotion linkage to limbic and prefrontal modulation, but empirical support remains limited. Meanwhile, it is increasingly recognized that sensory cortex supports flexible, value-based processing beyond labeled-line sensory analysis. Assaying early visual cortical activity (using visual evoked potentials/VEPs) across four high-density electroencephalogram (hd-EEG) experiments, involving three independent samples (N = 150) and repeated assessments (up to three waves), we identify a reliable and generalizable pattern of visual cortical hyperactivity related to high trait anxiety. Notably, this effect was specific to the parvocellular (vs. magnocellular) pathway, emerging as early as 46 ms and localized to V1. Underscoring its trait-like stability, the effect was reproducible across different arousal states, neutral and negative stimuli, extended time intervals, and varied experimental paradigms. Moreover, its ecological validity was affirmed by its presence in response to both basic low-level stimuli (Gabor patches) and complex real-world images. Crucially, an excitation-inhibition (E/I) ratio (indexed by the resting-state EEG aperiodic exponent; 1/f slope) predicted parvocellular VEP magnitude in subjects with low but not high trait anxiety, suggesting disrupted E/I modulation in trait anxiety underpins this hyperactivity. We conclude that in trait anxiety, early visual processing deviates from strict fidelity to physical-world input or mere subservience to top-down modulation, instead adapting to an individual biological propensity at the earliest processing stage.",

    "content": "This study presents a deep probabilistic spiking neural network designed to extract discriminative spatiotemporal features from EEG signals associated with rightward and leftward auditory attention. The network self-organizes its synaptic weights and inter-layer connectivity through a biologically inspired learning rule shaped by probabilistic feedback inhibition and spike-based synchronization dynamics. To characterize the model behavior and identify optimal operating conditions, we systematically examined the effects of key parameters including inhibition strength, synchronization parameters, and preprocessing thresholds on network stability and classification performance. Simulation results show that feedback inhibition is essential for preventing uncontrolled synaptic growth, maintaining sparse connectivity, and enabling stable learning. Strong inhibition suppresses connectivity and weight development, whereas weak inhibition leads to excessive synaptic expansion. An intermediate inhibition regime achieves a balance between adaptability and stability, resulting in the most effective feature extraction. Output-layer neurons exhibited heterogeneous activation dynamics, reflecting diverse encoding of EEG input patterns. The excitatory firing probability was tightly modulated by the inhibition parameter, confirming its central role in shaping network responses. Synchronization parameters further influenced synaptic dynamics, producing nonlinear effects on spike coordination and weight evolution. Classification accuracy peaked at intermediate synchronization levels, revealing an optimal regime where inhibition and synchronization jointly support efficient classification of rightward and leftward EEG data. Additional analyses demonstrated that synaptic pruning substantially improves accuracy across all inhibition levels and that the model performs best when input spikes are generated using a preprocessing threshold of 0.3. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that the developed neural network model achieves an average accuracy of 90% while utilizing only 10% of the available EEG data. Overall, the findings show that the proposed spiking neural network achieves its highest classification performance under moderate inhibition, intermediate synchronization, sparse connectivity, and appropriate pruning. These results highlight the promise of biologically inspired spiking architectures for decoding EEG-based attentional states, particularly in settings with limited training data and strong temporal structure.",

    "title": "Explainable 3D CNNs link regional and network level disruption in early Parkinson's MRIs to symptom progression",
    "content": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population over 65. Clinical diagnosis typically depends on tracking gradually developing motor symptoms as the disease progresses, underscoring the need for early detection methods to aid intervention while symptoms are still minor. Inexpensive and widely available imaging modalities such as T1-weighted MRI (T1w MRI) have potential for early PD diagnosis but lack established systematic biomarkers of PD pathology. In this study, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) was trained on 100 predominately early-state PD and 100 control T1w MRIs from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), achieving a classification accuracy of 84.5%. Misclassified subjects were majority unmedicated and particularly early PD (< 3 years since first symptoms). To interrogate the biological basis behind the model's decisions, novel explainability methods were applied to generate regional saliency maps from both PD and control classifications. Regional saliency across subjects correlated best with cognitive and motor scores in nigrostriatal and other subcortical regions, as well as in temporal and insular cortices, indicating changes in these areas were best connected with symptom progression. The model was also sensitive to changes in the left frontal cortex across many subjects, which exhibited the greatest raw saliency magnitude. Pairwise saliency correlation was most pronounced between areas within the same functional network, suggesting the CNN was sensitive to network level changes in structural MRI. These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable 3D CNNs to identify network and regional biomarkers of early PD from T1w MRI.",

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM.

    "content": "<p>I've been working on Fast LiteLLM - a Rust acceleration layer for the popular LiteLLM library - and I had some interesting learnings that might resonate with other developers trying to squeeze performance out of existing systems.<p>My assumption was that LiteLLM, being a Python library, would have plenty of low-hanging fruit for optimization. I set out to create a Rust layer using PyO3 to accelerate the performance-critical parts: token counting, routing, rate limiting, and connection pooling.<p>The Approach<p>- Built Rust implementations for token counting using tiktoken-rs<p>- Added lock-free data structures with DashMap for concurrent operations<p>- Implemented async-friendly rate limiting<p>- Created monkeypatch shims to replace Python functions transparently<p>- Added comprehensive feature flags for safe, gradual rollouts<p>- Developed performance monitoring to track improvements in real-time<p>After building out all the Rust acceleration, I ran my comprehensive benchmark comparing baseline LiteLLM vs. the shimmed version:<p>Function             Baseline Time   Shimmed Time    Speedup    Improvement  Status<p>token_counter        0.000035s     0.000036s     0.99x          -0.6%<p>count_tokens_batch   0.000001s     0.000001s     1.10x          +9.1%<p>router               0.001309s     0.001299s     1.01x          +0.7%<p>rate_limiter         0.000000s     0.000000s     1.85x         +45.9%<p>connection_pool      0.000000s     0.000000s     1.63x         +38.7%<p>Turns out LiteLLM is already quite well-optimized! The core token counting was essentially unchanged (0.6% slower, likely within measurement noise), and the most significant gains came from the more complex operations like rate limiting and connection pooling where Rust's concurrent primitives made a real difference.<p>Key Takeaways<p>1. Don't assume existing libraries are under-optimized - The maintainers likely know their domain well\n2. Focus on algorithmic improvements over reimplementation - Sometimes a better approach beats a faster language\n3. Micro-benchmarks can be misleading - Real-world performance impact varies significantly\n4. The most gains often come from the complex parts, not the simple operations\n5. Even \"modest\" improvements can matter at scale - 45% improvements in rate limiting are meaningful for high-throughput applications<p>While the core token counting saw minimal improvement, the rate limiting and connection pooling gains still provide value for high-volume use cases. The infrastructure I built (feature flags, performance monitoring, safe fallbacks) creates a solid foundation for future optimizations.<p>The project continues as Fast LiteLLM on GitHub for anyone interested in the Rust-Python integration patterns, even if the performance gains were humbling.<p>Edit: To clarify - the negative performance for token_counter is likely in the noise range of measurement, suggesting that LiteLLM's token counting is already well-optimized. The 45%+ gains in rate limiting and connection pooling still provide value for high-throughput applications.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45968461\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45968461</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "A growing body of literature describes the anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anti-epileptic properties of the cannabis sativa constituent cannabidiol, suggesting that it might play a useful role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 disease) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorder resulting from an inherited dysfunction of the lysosome. CLN2 disease, and its representative animal models, display neuroimmune response, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and epileptic seizures, and these symptoms are all touted as potential targets of cannabidiol therapeutic benefit. Here, we treated a valid model of CLN2 disease with long-term daily cannabidiol (300mg/kg) from 1 month of age until disease end stage and evaluated epileptic seizures, lifespan, and markers of neuroimmune response. Chronic cannabidiol treatment significantly delayed or fully eliminated seizures in CLN2 mice compared to those treated with vehicle only, and the treatment led to a nearly significant extension of lifespan. These effects occurred in the absence of any therapeutic benefit to physiological markers of disease such as GFAP, CD68, and cytokine/chemokine reactivity. Taken together, we show that chronic treatment with cannabidiol confers significant anti-seizure benefit to the mouse model of CLN2 disease, and that it does not appear to do so by altering the inflammatory and neuroimmune markers traditionally used to track CLN2 disease progression.",

    "title": "Differential regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates in neurons versus astrocytes during cellular stress",
    "content": "Sequestosome 1/p62 (hereafter referred to as p62) is a multifunctional protein that orchestrates various cellular stress response pathways including autophagy, proteasome-mediated degradation, antioxidant defense, nutrient sensing, and inflammatory signaling. Mutations in distinct functional domains of p62 are linked with the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), underscoring its importance in neural cells. Neurons and astrocytes perform distinct roles in brain physiology and thus encounter a unique landscape of cellular stress. However, how p62 is regulated in these cell types in response to various stress modalities remains largely unexplored. Several functions for p62 depend on engagement with ubiquitinated substrates. Thus, we investigated how the regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates differs between neurons and astrocytes exposed to two stress modalities: lysosomal membrane damage and metabolic stress. Lysosomal damage triggered ubiquitin-dependent assembly of p62 puncta in both neurons and astrocytes. In contrast, nutrient deprivation elicited different responses between neurons and astrocytes. Neurons formed p62-ubiquitin structures more prominently and displayed a greater dependence on ubiquitin for p62 clustering. Together, these findings reveal cell-type-specific and stress-specific regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates, indicating that neurons and astrocytes can deploy distinct quality control strategies.",

    "title": "Methamphetamine Conditioned Place Preference in Adolescent Mice: Interaction Between Sex and Strain",
    "content": "Background: Methamphetamine (METH) use is higher in adolescent women than men. While rodent studies support a sex difference in the reinforcing effects of METH, few have investigated sex differences in the underlying neural circuits, none of which tested rodents during adolescence. Aims: Investigate whether there are sex differences in the rewarding effects of METH in two strains of adolescent mice that are commonly used to generate transgenic lines. Identify changes in associated neural circuits. Methods: We tested METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male and female 129Sv/Ev and C57Bl/6 mice during middle adolescence using 1mg/kg of METH. Behaviorally-induced upregulation of c-Fos protein expression was quantified in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and area CA1 of the hippocampus following the post-conditioning test. Results: In C57Bl/6 mice, METH induced CPP in females, but not males. Conversely, METH-induced CPP in 129Sv/Ev males, but not females. In both strains, groups that exhibited CPP had more c-Fos+ cells in the NAc and CA1 when compared to saline-treated control groups. The number of c-Fos+ cells in these two brain regions correlated in groups exhibiting CPP, indicating increased NAc-CA1 communication during retrieval of the conditioned memory. Finally, we found evidence of behavioral sensitization in 129Sv/Ev males only. Conclusions: Our study reveals that the rewarding effects of the METH in adolescent mice are both sex- and strain-dependent, indicating that METH response may result from an interaction between sex-specific and genetic mechanisms. Our findings will be informative when selecting an appropriate background strain in future studies using genetically modified mice.",

    "title": "Opposite and complementary roles of the two calcium thresholds for inducing LTP and LTD in models of striatal projection neurons",
    "content": "Synaptic plasticity has been shown to occur when calcium, flowing into the synapse due to incoming stimuli, surpasses a threshold level. This threshold level is modifiable through a process called metaplasticity. Some neurons, such as the striatal projection neurons, use different sources of calcium as the signal for synaptic strengthening (long-term potentiation, LTP) or weakening (long-term depression, LTD), resulting in them having two thresholds for inducing plasticity. In this study, we show opposite and complementary roles of metaplasticity in these two thresholds for inducing LTP and LTD on learning how to solve the linear and nonlinear feature binding problem (FBP and NFBP). In short, metaplasticity in one threshold (e.g. LTD) allows synaptic plasticity of the opposite type (e.g. LTP) to be properly expressed. This happens because metaplasticity in the LTD threshold protects strengthened synapses from weakening, thus allowing them to persistently increase during learning (and encode learned patterns). Similarly, metaplasticity in the LTP threhsold prevents weakened synapses from strengthening, thus allowing them to persistently decrease. Metaplasticity in both thresholds is necessary when synapses are clustered and the neuron needs to rely on supralinear dendritic integration for learning.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is a reusable project template for building modern, full-stack web applications entirely in Python, with a focus on rapid development for demos and internal tools.</p> <h3><strong>What My Project Does</strong></h3> <p>The template provides a complete, pre-configured application foundation using a modern Python stack. It includes:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Backend Framework:</strong> FastAPI (ASGI, async, Pydantic validation)</li> <li> <strong>Frontend Framework:</strong> NiceGUI (component-based, server-side UI)</li> <li> <strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL (managed with Docker Compose)</li> <li> <strong>ORM:</strong> SQLModel (combines SQLAlchemy + Pydantic)</li> <li> <strong>Authentication:</strong> JWT token-based security with pre-built logic.</li> <li> <strong>Core Functionality:</strong> <ul> <li> Full CRUD API for items.</li> <li> User management with role-based access (Standard User vs. Superuser).</li> <li> Dynamic UI that adapts based on the logged-in user's permissions.</li> <li> Automatic API documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>The project is structured with a clean separation between <code>backend</code> and <code>frontend</code> code, making it easy to navigate and build upon.</p> <h3><strong>Target Audience</strong></h3> <p>This template is intended for Python developers who:</p> <ul> <li> Need to build web applications with interactive UIs but want to stay within the Python ecosystem.</li> <li> Are building internal tools, administrative dashboards, or data-heavy applications.</li> <li> Want to quickly create prototypes, MVPs, or demos for ML/data science projects.</li> </ul> <p>It's currently a well-structured starting point. While it can be extended for production, it's best suited for developers who value rapid development and a single-language stack over the complexities of a decoupled frontend for these specific use cases.</p> <h3><strong>Comparison</strong></h3> <ul> <li><p><strong>vs. JS Frontend (React/Vue):</strong> This stack is the industry standard for complex, public-facing applications. The primary difference is that this template <strong>eliminates the Node.js toolchain and build process</strong>. It's designed for efficiency when a separate JS frontend is overkill.</p></li> <li><p><strong>vs. Streamlit:</strong> These are excellent for creating linear, data-centric dashboards. This template's use of NiceGUI provides <strong>more granular control over page layout and component placement</strong>, making it better for building applications with a more traditional, multi-page web structure and complex, non-linear user workflows.</p></li> </ul> <h3><strong>Source &amp; Blog</strong></h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Source Code:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/jaehyeon-kim/nicegui-fastapi-template\">https://github.com/jaehyeon-kim/nicegui-fastapi-template</a></li> <li> <strong>Blog Post / Docs:</strong> <a href=\"https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2025-11-19-fastapi-nicegui-template/\">https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2025-11-19-fastapi-nicegui-template/</a></li> </ul> <p>The project is stable and ready to be used as a starter.

    "title": "Toward in-silico data assessment for passive BCIs: generating EEG rhythms with GANs",
    "content": "Objective. Passive brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) has gained traction as reliable method for monitoring human vigilance in attention-demanding critical contexts. Unfortunately, the lack of extensive public datasets compromises artificial intelligence (AI) research. Proposing a solution to this issue, we augmented two EEG datasets using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Furthermore, we defined a quality-assessment pipeline to overcome the absence of a univocal method to test synthetic data. Approach. Using GAN, we augmented a publicly resting-state EEG dataset sustained attention to response task and a custom one simulating activity during repetitive tasks. After extracting relevant time-variant rhythms via the continuous wavelet transform, we quantitatively compared synthetic data with the real one using L2 distance and cross-correlation function. To evaluate the impact of data augmentation, we trained six forecasting models, three on the original and three on the augmented datasets, over the whole, half and a quarter of total available data, and compared improvements in MAE and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). To study the forecaster\u2019s embeddings, we computed a metric inspired by the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID) between latent values of real and synthetic data. Finally, to offer a baseline comparison, we extended the performance and embeddings analysis to data generated by a simple linear interpolation method. Main results. The integration of GAN-produced synthetic data improved signal prediction, as evidenced by a 29.0%, 46.4%, 37.4% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for splits of the resting-state dataset, and an average MAE reduction of 15.4%, 21.2% for 100% and 50% splits, and a \u223c2.5% increase for the 25% split. Conversely, training on interpolated data manifests worse performance and denotes extremely small FID distances w.r.t real signals, a sign of overspecialization. Significance. This study contributes a reproducible and complete framework for EEG signal generation and evaluation, addressing one of the main barriers to scalable AI application in BCI.",

    "title": "Finite element model predicts micromotion-induced strain profiles that correlate with the functional performance of Utah arrays in humans and non-human primates",
    "content": "Objective. Utah arrays are widely used in both humans and non-human primates (NHPs) for intracortical brain\u2013computer interfaces, primarily for detecting electrical signals from cortical tissue to decode motor commands. Recently, these arrays have also been applied to deliver electrical stimulation aimed at restoring sensory functions. A key challenge limiting their longevity is the micromotion between the array and cortical tissue, which may induce mechanical strain in surrounding tissue and contribute to performance decline. This strain, due to mechanical mismatch, can exacerbate glial scarring around the implant, reducing the efficacy of Utah arrays in recording neuronal activity and delivering electrical stimulation. Approach. To investigate this, we employed a finite element model to predict tissue strains resulting from micromotion. Main results. Our findings indicated that strain profiles around edge and corner electrodes were greater than those around interior shanks, affecting both maximum and average strains within 50 \u00b5m of the electrode tip. We then correlated these predicted tissue strains with in-vivo electrode performance metrics. We found negative correlations between 1 kHz impedance and tissue strains in human motor arrays and NHP area V4 arrays at 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years post-implantation. In human motor arrays, the peak-to-peak waveform voltage and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spontaneous activity were also negatively correlated with strain. Conversely, we observed a positive correlation between the evoked SNR of multi-unit activity and strain in NHP area V4 arrays. Significance. This study establishes a spatial dependence of electrode performance in Utah arrays that correlates with tissue strain.",

    "title": "Iris 128x: open-source 128 channel headstages for neural stimulation and recording",
    "content": "Objective. Investigation into complex neural circuits necessitates interfaces capable of high channel count recording and stimulation. However, existing commercial neural headstages often have limited scalability, restrictive proprietary designs, and constrained bidirectional capabilities, which worsens accessibility challenges and compels researchers to reinvent tools rather than build on a shared foundation. Approach. Here, we present two open-source, 128 channel headstages\u2014Iris 128B and Iris 128S\u2014designed for integration with microelectrode arrays. The Iris 128B enables fully bidirectional interfacing, with stimulation or recording across all 128 electrode channels, while the Iris 128S provides recording on 128 channels and stimulation on 16 simultaneous channels, which can be assigned to any 16 of the 32 available stimulation channels. Both designs use Intan Technologies\u2019 RHS and RHD series integrated circuits for amplification, filtering, digitization and stimulation, and are available on GitHub. Main results. The headstages were validated through benchtop impedance, noise, and frequency response measurements, as well as acute in vivo recordings in an anesthetized rat. Results demonstrate low noise levels and reliable signal acquisition across all channels. Significance. By releasing fully documented printed circuit board designs for headstages, this work aims to take a step towards broader adoption of bidirectional recording and stimulation systems while increasing channel counts. Future iterations will focus on miniaturization and wireless integration to improve usability in chronic and freely moving small animal experiments.",

    "title": "Tuberous sclerosis complex, epilepsy, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis: a pilot study of shared and divergent microbial signatures",
    "content": "ObjectiveTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) presents with a broad clinical spectrum. While some individuals exhibit mild symptoms, most experience seizures and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Emerging evidence suggests that both genetic and environmental factors, including gut microbiota, may influence epilepsy susceptibility. The microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA) is a key communication pathway through which intestinal microbes impact the central nervous system. Although the role of the MGBA in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, particularly seizures, has been explored in both animal models and humans, data specific to TSC are lacking.MethodsIn this exploratory study, we assessed whether individuals with TSC (n\u202f=\u202f15) display a distinct gut microbial signature using V3\u2013V4 16S rRNA sequencing. Their profiles were compared with two control groups: 18 children with epilepsy (EPI) and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Stool short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels and dietary intake were also evaluated.ResultsNo significant differences were observed among the three groups in dietary intake, SCFA and branched-chain fatty acid (BCFA) levels, or alpha-diversity. Beta-diversity analysis showed a non-significant trend toward clustering of TSC and EPI samples, indicating a shared microbial profile distinct from HC. Taxonomic analysis revealed a reduction in Firmicutes\u2014particularly the Ruminococcaceae family and the genus Gemmiger\u2014in both TSC and EPI groups, consistent with epilepsy-associated dysbiosis. Notably, the TSC group showed a specific enrichment in Akkermansiaceae, a feature also reported in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as CDKL5 deficiency disorder and cerebral palsy.SignificanceThese preliminary findings suggest that gut microbiota alterations may contribute to neuroinflammatory processes linked to epileptogenesis and comorbidities in TSC. Further studies are needed to validate these results and explore microbiota-based therapeutic strategies aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals with TSC and their caregivers.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working on a small side project called <strong>virtualshell</strong> and wanted to share it here in case it\u2019s useful to anyone mixing Python and PowerShell.</p> <p>Repo (source + docs): <a href=\"https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell\">https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell</a></p> <p>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/virtualshell/\">https://pypi.org/project/virtualshell/</a></p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>In short: <strong>virtualshell lets Python talk to a persistent PowerShell process</strong>, instead of spawning a new one for every command.</p> <ul> <li>You <code>pip install virtualshell</code> and work with a <code>Shell</code> class from Python.</li> <li>Under the hood, a C++ backend manages a long-lived PowerShell process.</li> <li>State is preserved between calls (variables, functions, imported modules, env vars, etc.).</li> <li>It also has an optional <strong>zero-copy shared-memory bridge</strong> on Windows for moving large blobs/objects without re-serializing over stdout.</li> </ul> <p>Very minimal example:</p> <pre><code>from virtualshell import Shell with Shell(timeout_seconds=5, set_UTF8=True) as sh: result = sh.run(&quot;Get-Date&quot;) print(result.out.strip(), result.exit_code) # State is kept between calls: sh.run(&quot;$global:counter++&quot;) print(sh.run(&quot;$counter&quot;).out.strip()) </code></pre> <p>From the Python side you mainly get:</p> <ul> <li><code>Shell.run()</code> / <code>run_async()</code> / <code>script()</code> / <code>script_async()</code> - run commands or scripts, sync or async</li> <li>Structured result objects: <code>out</code>, <code>err</code>, <code>exit_code</code>, <code>ok</code>, <code>duration_ms</code></li> <li>Config options for which host to use (<code>pwsh</code> vs <code>powershell.exe</code>), working directory, env, etc.</li> <li>Zero-copy helpers for sending/receiving big byte buffers or serialized PowerShell objects (Windows only for now)</li> </ul> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This is <strong>not</strong> meant as a big \u201cframework\u201d, more like a glue tool for a fairly specific niche:</p> <ul> <li>People using <strong>Python as the main orchestrator</strong>, but who still rely on PowerShell for: <ul> <li>existing scripts/modules</li> <li>Windows automation tasks</li> <li>Dev/ops tooling that is already PowerShell-centric</li> </ul></li> <li>Long-running services, data pipelines, or test harnesses that: <ul> <li>don\u2019t want to pay the cost of starting a new PowerShell process each time</li> <li>want to keep session state alive across many calls</li> </ul></li> <li>Windows users who occasionally need to move <strong>large amounts of data</strong> between PowerShell and Python and care about overhead.</li> </ul> <p>At this stage I still consider it a <strong>serious side project / early-stage library</strong>: it\u2019s usable, but I fully expect rough edges and would not claim it\u2019s \u201cbattle-tested in production\u201d yet.</p> <h1>Comparison (How It Differs From Existing Alternatives)</h1> <p>There are already several ways to use PowerShell from Python, so this is just another take on the problem:</p> <ul> <li><strong>vs. plain</strong> <code>subprocess</code> <strong>calls</strong> <ul> <li>With <code>subprocess.run(&quot;pwsh \u2026&quot;)</code> you pay process start-up cost and lose state after each call.</li> <li>virtualshell keeps a <strong>single long-lived process</strong> and tracks commands, timing, and exit codes in a higher-level API.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>vs. using PowerShell only / no Python</strong> <ul> <li>If your main logic/tooling is in Python (data processing, web services, tests), this lets you call into PowerShell where it makes sense without switching your whole stack.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>vs. other interop solutions (e.g., COM, pythonnet, remoting libraries, etc.)</strong> <ul> <li>Those are great for deep integration or remoting scenarios.</li> <li>My focus here is a <strong>simple, local, script-friendly API</strong>: <code>Shell.run()</code>, structured results, and an optional performance path (shared memory) when you need to move bigger payloads.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Performance-wise, the zero-copy path is mainly there to avoid serializing tens of MB through stdout/stderr. It\u2019s still early, so I\u2019m very interested in real-world benchmarks from other machines and setups.</p> <p>If anyone has feedback on:</p> <ul> <li>parts of the API that feel un-Pythonic,</li> <li>missing use cases I haven\u2019t thought about, or</li> <li>things that would make it safer/easier to adopt in real projects,</li> </ul> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate it.</p> <p>Again, the source and docs are here: <a href=\"https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell\">https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chamoswor\"> /u/Chamoswor </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ozf67i/project_virtualshell_keep_a_longlived_powershell/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ozf67i/project_virtualshell_keep_a_longlived_powershell/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It currently provides:</p> <ul> <li>2-D formats: <strong>CSR, CSC, COO</strong></li> <li>N-D tensors: <strong>COOND</strong> (N-dimensional COO)</li> <li>Kernels for <code>float64</code> values / <code>int64</code> indices: <ul> <li>SpMV / SpMM</li> <li>Reductions: total sum, row/column sums</li> <li>Transpose</li> <li>Arithmetic: add, sub, Hadamard (elementwise)</li> <li>Cleanup: <code>prune(eps)</code>, <code>eliminate_zeros</code></li> </ul></li> <li>N-D COO ops: <ul> <li><code>sum</code>, <code>mean</code></li> <li><code>reduce_*_axes</code>, <code>permute_axes</code>, <code>reshape</code></li> <li>broadcasting Hadamard</li> <li>unfold to CSR/CSC along a mode or grouped axes</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>The Python API is designed to work smoothly with NumPy, using zero-copy reads of input buffers when it\u2019s safe.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Lacuna is intended for people who:</p> <ul> <li>Work with <strong>large sparse matrices or tensors</strong> (e.g. scientific computing, FEM/CFD, graph problems, PageRank, power iterations)</li> <li>Need <strong>high-performance kernels</strong> but want to stay in Python/NumPy world</li> <li>Are interested in experimenting with <strong>N-D sparse arrays</strong> (beyond 2-D matrices) without densifying</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s currently a <strong>work-in-progress</strong> project (APIs and performance characteristics may change), so it\u2019s best suited for experimentation, research, and early adopters rather than critical production workloads.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>SciPy.sparse</strong> <ul> <li>Very mature and battle-tested for 2-D sparse linear algebra.</li> <li>Mainly matrix-first: N-D use cases often require reshaping or densifying.</li> <li>Lacuna aims to complement this with N-D COO tensors plus explicit unfold operations, while still providing fast CSR/CSC/COO kernels.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>PyData/Sparse (</strong><code>sparse</code><strong>)</strong> <ul> <li>Provides N-D COO arrays with NumPy-like semantics and broadcasting.</li> <li>Lacuna takes a more \u201ckernel-first\u201d approach: Rust + SIMD + Rayon, with a tighter set of operations focused on performance (SpMV/SpMM, reductions, transforms) and explicit unfold to CSR/CSC for linear-algebra-style workloads.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019re already comfortable with NumPy and SciPy.sparse, Lacuna is meant to feel familiar but give you more explicit tools for N-D sparse tensors and high-performance kernels.</p> <p><strong>Source &amp; Docs</strong></p> <ul> <li>Source code: <strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/hanziwww/lacuna\"><code>https://github.com/hanziwww/lacuna</code></a></li> <li>Docs &amp; examples: <a href=\"https://lacuna.hanziwww.me/\">https://lacuna.hanziwww.me</a></li> </ul> <p>Status: <strong>in active development</strong>.

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

    "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
    "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

    "title": "On the Causal Role of the Right Lateral Prefrontal Cortex in Active Forgetting",
    "content": "Extensive research has demonstrated that people can intentionally forget by inhibiting the retrieval of unwanted memories, a phenomenon known as suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Although neuroimaging studies have linked retrieval suppression to the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), direct evidence for the causal role this region plays in supporting SIF is still lacking. In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC. Our results will provide novel and critical insights into the brain mechanisms of inhibitory control.",

    "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
    "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

    "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
    "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

    "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

    "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

    "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

    "content": "IntroductionIdentifying brain topology alterations in chronic pain is a crucial step in understanding its pathophysiology. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess alterations in resting-state functional and structural global network properties in patients with chronic pain.MethodsFollowing the preregistration (PROSPERO CRD42024542390), databases were searched for studies comparing connectivity-based whole-brain global network properties between patients with chronic pain and healthy controls. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted for each global network property separately.ResultsA total of 32 functional topology studies and 17 structural topology studies were included in the qualitative review, with 27 functional topology studies and 17 structural topology studies eligible for meta-analysis across nine unique structural and functional global network properties. The number of participants per meta-analysis ranged from 178 to 1,592. There was low-certainty evidence that chronic pain patients showed impairments in local efficiency of resting-state functional whole-brain topology (SMD: \u22120.50, 95%-CI: \u22120.81 to \u22120.19, 95%-PI: \u22121.38 to 0.38), and low to very low-certainty evidence that structural whole-brain topology was not altered in chronic pain across nine global network properties. The heterogeneity was high in the majority of functional (I2: 1\u201376%) and structural (I2: 68\u201397%) topology studies. Most functional (50%) and structural (65%) topology studies showed some concern regarding the risk of bias.DiscussionThe meta-analyses indicate that functional but not structural whole-brain topological reorganisation is involved in the pathophysiology of chronic pain.",

    "content": "The treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) presents significant challenges, with median survival rates remaining low despite standard-of-care therapies. A novel approach, cytostatic hypothermia (CH), is under development against GBM; it is a window of temperature (typically 20 \u00b0C\u201325 \u00b0C) which halts tumor growth in vivo. Objective. This feasibility study expands upon the findings through the computational evaluation of a fully implantable system. Our simulations evaluate a thermoelectric cooler with a microwire array (NeuraTEC) and a novel ambient recirculating core (ARC) to achieve uniform cooling of a region in the brain without overheating local skin temperature. Approach. Finite-element modeling was employed to simulate coupled bioheat transfer and laminar non-isothermal fluid flow dynamics. Main results. Our results indicate that NeuraTEC can attain local tissue temperatures within a cytostatic range while minimizing thermal gradients. The use of multiple narrow, thermally conductive wires enhances cooling uniformity with minimal tissue displacement. The ARC provides a unique form of heat management that enables full implantability and hence portability. This work suggests it can facilitate the transfer of heat from a brain region to the skin. Future work will focus on device prototyping and validation through in vitro and in vivo studies in large animal models. Significance. These simulations suggest that the proposed intracranial cooling system could make CH a practicable approach against GBM. Furthermore, this approach to internal heat management may also open new avenues for treating neurological conditions through local and chronic hypothermia, extending beyond the short-duration (acute) cooling methods currently tested.",

    "title": "Source tracing with spatial phase gradients in epileptiform activity localizes seizure onset zone",
    "content": "Objective. Sources of epileptic traveling waves offer critical insights into seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, making them invaluable for preoperative assessment in patients with epilepsy. However, the absence of tailored source-tracing methods and the inherent instability of epileptiform activity make it difficult to achieve reliable source identification for SOZ localization. This study aimed to analyze the propagation pattern during seizure events and develop a framework to trace the sources of epileptic expanding traveling waves (ETWs). Approach. 101 seizure events were recorded from five 4-Aminopyridine-induced acute cortical rat epilepsy models. In each seizure event, epileptiform activities were classified into two categories according to their time-frequency diagrams (multiband and non-multiband epileptiform activities). The center of the SOZ was regarded as the recording site with the largest amplitude of epileptiform activities. Using the spatial-phase-based analysis, we analyzed the propagation pattern during the seizure event and extracted the ETWs. The sources of ETWs were traced by the intersection of spatial-phase-gradient. Main results. The ETW proportion of multiband epileptiform activities was 62.7% 8.3%, significantly higher than those in non-multiband epileptiform activities (53.8% 9.0%). ETWs with stable propagation patterns gave rise to a concentrated source tracing outcome. The single-band signal (component of the multiband activities) had a more stable ETW propagation pattern than both the multiband and non-multiband activities. The source tracing results of the single-band signals clustered around the SOZ center and remained stable even when the SOZ center was out of coverage (removing half of the recording sites, among which the SOZ center was included). Significance. The proposed framework enables ETW extraction from epileptiform activities and can trace ETW sources even when the sources are out of coverage. Therefore, the proposed framework may prove clinically valuable in cases with sparse intracranial recordings, addressing the limitation of traditional SOZ localization methods.",

    "title": "Foundation models for EEG decoding: current progress and prospective research",
    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the spontaneous electrical activity in the brain. Despite the growing application of deep learning in EEG decoding, traditional methods still rely heavily on supervised learning, which is often limited by task specificity and dataset dependency, restricting model performance and generalization. Inspired by the success of large language models, EEG foundation models (EEG FMs) are attracting increasing attention as a unified paradigm for EEG decoding. In this study, we review a selection of representative studies on EEG FMs, aiming to extract trends and provide recommendations for future research. Approach. We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in EEG FMs, with a focus on downstream tasks, benchmark datasets, model architectures, and pre-training techniques. We analyze and synthesize core FMs components, and systematically compare their performances and generalizabilities. Main results. Our review reveals that EEG FMs are pre-trained on large-scale datasets, typically involving several hundred subjects. The number of subjects can reach up to 14\u2009987, with a maximum total duration of 27\u2009062\u2009h. Current EEG FMs most adopt mask-based reconstruction pre-training strategy and employ efficient transformer-based architectures. Our comparative analysis shows that EEG FMs demonstrate significant potential in advancing EEG decoding tasks, particularly in seizure detection. However, their performance in complex scenarios such as motor imagery decoding remains limited. Significance. This review summarizes the existing approaches and performance outcomes of EEG FM, offers valuable insights into their current limitations and delineates prospective avenues for future research.",

    "title": "Nighttime sleep modulates mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila",
    "content": "Organisms must focus their attention on ethologically relevant stimuli to maximise survival and reproduction. This is achieved, in part, through a process termed habituation, in which responses to repeated or constant sensory inputs are sequentially dampened, favouring robust responses to novel stimuli. Prior investigations in the fruit fly, Drosophila, have uncovered genes and neural mechanisms that facilitate habituation. However, these works have primarily focused on habituation to visual, olfactory, and gustatory, stimuli. In contrast, neurogenetic processes promoting habituation to mechanosensory stimuli have been less studied. Here we develop an automated system that yields long-term analogue measurements of mechanosensory habituation in adult fruit flies. Using this platform, we reveal a role for the neuronal calcium sensor Neurocalcin in habituation to mechanical stimuli. Loss of Neurocalcin disrupts nighttime but not daytime sleep, particularly under long-night conditions. Mimicking a method used to treat insomnia, we show that compressing nighttime duration restores consolidated night sleep in Neurocalcin mutants. Surprisingly, this manipulation also renormalises mechanosensory habituation in this background, suggesting a link between sleep and mechanosensory habituation. Indeed, we show that limiting night sleep duration in wild type flies similarly impairs habituation to mechanosensory stimuli. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated link between nighttime sleep and mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila.",

    "title": "Selective engagement of the primate orbitofrontal cortex during value-based but not perceptual decisions",
    "content": "A fundamental question in neuroscience is whether the brain uses specialized sub-systems for different types of decisions or relies on a unified decision-making network. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) provides an ideal test case for this question: it has a well-established role in value-based decisions but it remains unknown whether this reflects functional specialization or participation in a broader, general decision network. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used Neuropixels to monitor large ensembles of OFC neurons as a monkey performed both value-based and perceptual decision tasks. Consistent with prior reports, OFC was robustly engaged during value-based decisions. In contrast, OFC was minimally engaged during perceptual decisions, with no significant encoding of task parameters at either the single neuron or population level. This highlights the functional specialization of the OFC for value-based decisions and suggests that the different cognitive demands underlying different types of decisions recruit distinct neural circuits.",

    "content": "ObjectiveBased on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), signal mining of adverse drug events (AEs) caused by Botulinum Toxin Type A (BoNTA) was performed to explore its safety implications for the treatment of cerebral palsy (CP).MethodsThe OpenVigil 2.1 platform was used to extract AE reports on BoNTA from the FAERS database, covering the period from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2024. Safety data were analyzed using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), with BoNTA designated as the primary suspect drug.ResultsA total of 124,538 AE reports related to BoNTA were identified, showing an overall upward trend in the annual report counts. Most reports originated from the United States, with patients predominantly aged 36\u201360\u202fyears and predominantly female. Prolonged hospitalization was the most frequently reported serious adverse event. Signal analysis identified 325 disproportionately reported events across 21 system-organ classes (SOCs). The top five preferred terms (PTs) by frequency were eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, muscle weakness, blurred vision, and injection site swelling. The top five PTs based on signal strength were brow ptosis, Mephisto sign, botulism, bizarre personal appearance, and neuromuscular toxicity. Notable lowest-level terms (LLTs) included eye swelling, injection site edema, facial pain, facial discomfort, increased residual urine volume, blurred vision, and eyelid swelling.ConclusionIn clinical practice involving BoNTA for CP treatment, clinicians should pay close attention to these identified signals. Strengthened pre-injection evaluation and post-injection monitoring are recommended to enable early detection and timely intervention, ensuring medication safety for patients.",

In the training set, prediction models for SCD were constructed using logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and neural network algorithms. Model performance on the validation set was assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F1 score. SHAP values were used for model interpretability analysis.ResultsThe SVM model showed good performance in the training set, with an AUC of 0.82, indicating strong predictive ability. Information Overload (IO), Self-Perception (SP), Energy Level (EL), Depressive Emotion (DE), Gender (SEX), Risk Decision (RD), and Short-Term Memory (STM) were important feature variables for SCD occurrence.ConclusionThis study successfully developed an SVM-based model for screening the risk of SCD.

    "content": "ObjectivesSturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a congenital neurological disorder occurring in the early childhood. Timely diagnosis of SWS is essential for proper medical intervention that prevents the development of various neurological issues. Leptomeningeal angiomas (LA) are the clinical manifestation of SWS. Detection of LA is currently performed by manual inspection of the magnetic resonance images (MRI) by experienced neurologist, which is time-consuming and lack of inter-rater consistency. The aim of the present study is to investigate automated LA detection in MRI of SWS patients.MethodsA Mamba-based encoder-decoder architecture was employed in the present study. Particularly, a multi-scale multi-scan strategy was proposed to convert 3-D volume into 1-D sequence, enabling capturing long-range dependency with reduced computation complexity. Our dataset consists of 40 SWS patients with T1-enhanced MRI. The proposed model was first pre-trained on a public brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) dataset and then fine-tuned and tested on the SWS dataset using 5-fold cross validation.Results and conclusionOur results show excellent performance of the proposed method, e.g., Dice score of 91.53% and 78.67% for BraTS and SWS, respectively, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods as well as two neurologists. Mamba-based deep learning method can automatically identify LA in MRI images, enabling automated SWS diagnosis in clinical settings.",

    "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

(b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

Here we examined the validity of a step threshold task to measure dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThirty-nine participants with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease underwent clinical testing and performed a dynamic balance assessment both OFF and ON dopaminergic medication. For the assessment, participants were instructed to avoid stepping in response to progressively larger postural perturbations applied via treadmill translations. The step threshold was defined as the perturbation magnitude that resulted in a stepping response on four consecutive trials. Validity was assessed by correlating medication-mediated changes in gold standard clinical measures and medication-mediated changes in stepping.ResultsMedication-mediated changes in step threshold correlated with changes in MDS-UPDRS part III (p < 0.01), with change in MDS-UPDRS 3.12 postural instability (p < 0.05), and with measures of executive function: CPT-3 Omission T-score (p = 0.013), the CPT-3 Commission T-score (p = 0.019), and the CPT-3 Variability T-score (p = 0.040).DiscussionOur results validate step threshold task as a measure of dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Correlations with gold standard assessments of motor and executive function suggest that the step threshold task can serve as a comprehensive measure of dynamic balance control.",

    "title": "The effects of aquatic and land-based interventions on children with developmental coordination disorder",
    "content": "BackgroundKnowledge about the effects of aquatic intervention on children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), as well as the maintenance of these effects over time, is still scarce. We believe that there is a need to advance our knowledge of this subject, for which we have set ourselves the following objectives: (1) to test whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions influence the motor performance of children with DCD; (2) to check whether these effects persist over time; and (3) whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions bring motor performance values closer together between children with DCD and those with typical development.Methods76 children aged between 6 and 10 years old were divided into four groups, control developmental coordination disorder (C-DCD); control typical development (C-TD); experimental terrestrial developmental coordination disorder (T-DCD); and experimental aquatic developmental coordination disorder (A-DCD). Due to some dropouts, the final sample consisted of 66 children, 27 girls and 39 boys. The groups of children with DCD were randomized according to their initial total score on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children Test - second edition (MABC-2). The analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) carried out in the pre-test showed similarity between the means of the DCD groups (C-DCD, T-DCD and A-DCD), which ensured that these groups started from the same performance level. The interventions lasted 4.5 months (18 weeks) with three sessions a week, totaling 54 sessions of 60 min each. The experimental groups took part in the same intervention protocol, with the only difference being the environment (A-DCD = aquatic environment; T-DCD = terrestrial environment).ResultsAnalysis of the results revealed no significant effect for the group and time point interaction, F(6, 133) = 1.36, p = 0.235. However, effects were detected for group, F(2, 54.7) = 3.78, p < 0.05, and for time point F(3, 131) = 22.91, p < 0.001. The Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test found a difference between the T-DCD and C-DCD groups (p < 0.05; independent-groups effect size (dig = 0.85; dig = 0.87; dig = 0.92). For time point, differences were found between the pre-test and the other time points [post-intervention (repeated measures effect size) (dR,M = 1.14), 3 months post-test (dR,M = 1.51) and 6 months post-test (dR,M = 2.2)] with a significance level of p < 0.001. For the A-DCD group there was no statistically significant difference in relation to either the C-DCD or T-DCD group, but we did observe large effect size values [pre-test and post-test (dR,M = 1.14), pre-test and 3 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.29) and pre-test and 6 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.61)]. Regarding the analysis of the Z score, the results indicated an interaction effect for the group and time point F(6, 132) = 2.30, p = 0.038. This difference was located by post hoc between the C-DCD group and the A-DCD (p < 0.05; independent groups pre-test - post-test effect size (digpp = 1.72) and dig = 0.79) and T-DCD (p < 0.05 ES digpp = 1.65 and dig = 0.79) groups at 6 months-post-test.ConclusionWe conclude that both aquatic and terrestrial interventions have positive effects on the motor performance of children with DCD, that these effects are maintained over time but also bring the motor performance of children with DCD closer to that of children with typical development.",

    "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and involves impairment of both motor and cognitive functions, significantly affecting the quality of walking and consequently the quality of life of people affected by this disease. This study analyzed the relationship between gait alterations and cognitive deterioration, using validated clinical tests and an innovative indicator, the \u03c6-bonacci gait number, which quantifies gait harmonicity, symmetry, and consistency. Kinematic data collected during the 6-Minute Walk test on 19 people with PD (pwPD) and 15 healthy adults were analyzed. The results highlighted a significant negative correlation between gait harmonicity and cognitive performance (\u03c6-bonacci gait number\u2014Time Up and Go Dual Task; r\u202f=\u202f0.797, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Finally, mediation analysis showed that global cognitive function (MoCA) indirectly influences gait harmonicity through TUG-DT. The results suggest that gait in pwPD is strongly modulated by executive-attentional functions, supporting its cognitive modulation rather than a purely automatic nature. This study allowed to explore the complex relationship between cognitive functions and the motor system, deepening how these interactions influence and refine motor behavior. Therefore, rehabilitation programs combining motor exercises and cognitive training could be more effective in improving gait quality, reducing the risk of falls, and improving person\u2019s quality of life.",

Considering the gap in understanding the relationship between cognitive impairments in Parkinson\u2019s disease and executive function, this study aimed to investigate the association between three cognitive statutes: normal cognition condition (PD-NCC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and mild dementia (PDD), and the performance of the Anterior Attentional System in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 96 participants with Parkinson\u2019s disease (45 with PD-NCC, 39 with PD-MCI, and 12 with PDD) and 46 participants from control group, recruited between 2020 and 2023. MDS-UPDRS was used during the neurological examination. To assess cognitive status, we used: Mini-Mental State Examination, Californian Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (A and B form). The ROtman Baycrest Battery was employed to evaluate the Anterior Attentional System.ResultsParticipants with PDD exhibited significant impairments in the Anterior Attentional System. Energization impairment was observed in PD-MCI and PDD, though mildly. Monitoring and task-setting processes were notably impaired only in individuals with PDD, while these functions remained intact in those with PD-NCC and PD-MCI.ConclusionThe Anterior Attentional System is well-preserved in PD-NCC and PD-MCI however notably disturbed in PDD.",

Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.12068v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Early detection of Cognitive Impairment (CI) is critical for timely intervention, preservation of independence, and reducing the burden of dementia. Yet, most screening tools remain lengthy, clinic-based, and poorly suited for large-scale unsupervised deployment. This paper evaluates the test-retest reliability, validity, and usability of mini-SPACE, a short iPad-based serious game for detecting early signs of CI. Participants played mini-SPACE at home without supervision once a week for three weeks, with a longer version of the game in the final week. Mini-SPACE showed good test-retest reliability in unsupervised settings. While younger age was the primary predictor of performance, usability, and cognitive load, participants of all ages were able to complete the tasks and reported good usability and low cognitive load. Importantly, the prediction of scores in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) improved with repeated measures. These findings highlight mini-SPACE as a promising digital marker for scalable, age-sensitive screening and potential longitudinal tracking of CI.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.11962v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of virtual 3D object manipulation along 4DoF on real surfaces in mixed reality (MR), using hand-based and tangible interactions. A custom cylindrical tangible proxy leverages affordances of physical knobs and tabletop support for stable input. We evaluate both modalities across isolated tasks (2DoF translation, 1DoF rotation scaling), semicombined (3DoF translation rotation), and full 4DoF compound manipulation.\n  We offer analyses of hand interactions, tangible interactions, and their comparison in MR tasks. For hand interactions, compound tasks required repetitive corrections, increasing completion times yet surprisingly, rotation errors were smaller in compound tasks than in rotation only tasks. Tangible interactions exhibited significantly larger errors in translation, rotation, and scaling during compound tasks compared to isolated tasks. Crucially, tangible interactions outperformed hand interactions in precision, likely due to tabletop support and constrained 4DoF design. These findings inform designers opting for hand-only interaction (highlighting tradeoffs in compound tasks) and those leveraging tangibles (emphasizing precision gains despite compound-task challenges).",

    "title": "\"Power of Words\": Stealthy and Adaptive Private Information Elicitation via LLM Communication Strategies",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.11961v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While communication strategies of Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial for human-LLM interactions, they can also be weaponized to elicit private information, yet such stealthy attacks remain under-explored. This paper introduces the first adaptive attack framework for stealthy and targeted private information elicitation via communication strategies. Our framework operates in a dynamic closed-loop: it first performs real-time psychological profiling of the users' state, then adaptively selects an optimized communication strategy, and finally maintains stealthiness through prompt-based rewriting. We validated this framework through a user study (N=84), demonstrating its generalizability across 3 distinct LLMs and 3 scenarios. The targeted attacks achieved a 205.4% increase in eliciting specific targeted information compared to stealthy interactions without strategies. Even stealthy interactions without specific strategies successfully elicited private information in 54.8% cases. Notably, users not only failed to detect the manipulation but paradoxically rated the attacking chatbot as more empathetic and trustworthy. Finally, we advocate for mitigations, encouraging developers to integrate adaptive, just-in-time alerts, users to build literacy against specific manipulative tactics, and regulators to define clear ethical boundaries distinguishing benign persuasion from coercion.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.11930v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In Extended Reality (XR), rendering sound that accurately simulates real-world acoustics is pivotal in creating lifelike and believable virtual experiences. However, existing XR spatial audio rendering methods often struggle with real-time adaptation to diverse physical scenes, causing a sensory mismatch between visual and auditory cues that disrupts user immersion. To address this, we introduce SAMOSA, a novel on-device system that renders spatially accurate sound by dynamically adapting to its physical environment. SAMOSA leverages a synergistic multimodal scene representation by fusing real-time estimations of room geometry, surface materials, and semantic-driven acoustic context. This rich representation then enables efficient acoustic calibration via scene priors, allowing the system to synthesize a highly realistic Room Impulse Response (RIR). We validate our system through technical evaluation using acoustic metrics for RIR synthesis across various room configurations and sound types, alongside an expert evaluation (N=12). Evaluation results demonstrate SAMOSA's feasibility and efficacy in enhancing XR auditory realism.",

We evaluate CollaClassroom with Bangladeshi university students (N = 12) through a small-group study session and a pre-post survey. Participants have substantial prior experience with collaborative learning and LLMs and express strong receptivity to LLM-assisted study (92% agree/strongly agree). Usability ratings are positive, including high learnability(67% \"easy\"), strong reliability (83% \"reliable\"), and low frustration (83% \"not at all\"). Correlational analyses show that participants who perceive the LLM as supporting equal participation also view it as a meaningful contributor to discussions (r = 0.86). Moreover, their pre-use expectations of LLM value align with post-use assessments (r = 0.61). These findings suggest that LLMs can enhance engagement and perceived learning when designed to promote equitable turn-taking and transparency across individual and shared spaces.

Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.11578v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In human-device coexistence systems, collaborations among devices are determined by not only physical attributes such as network topology but also social attributes among human users. Consequently, trust evaluation of potential collaborators based on these multifaceted attributes becomes critical for ensuring the eventual outcome. However, due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of physical and social attributes, efficiently integrating them for accurate trust evaluation remains challenging. To overcome this difficulty, a canonical correlation analysis-enhanced hypergraph self-supervised learning (HSLCCA) method is proposed in this research. First, by treating all attributes as relationships among connected devices, a relationship hypergraph is constructed to comprehensively capture inter-device relationships across three dimensions: spatial attribute-related, device attribute-related, and social attribute-related. Next, a self-supervised learning framework is developed to integrate these multi-dimensional relationships and generate device embeddings enriched with relational semantics. In this learning framework, the relationship hypergraph is augmented into two distinct views to enhance semantic information. A parameter-sharing hypergraph neural network is then utilized to learn device embeddings from both views. To further enhance embedding quality, a CCA approach is applied, allowing the comparison of data between the two views. Finally, the trustworthiness of devices is calculated based on the learned device embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HSLCCA method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithm in effectively identifying trusted devices.",

Morse-Smale dynamical systems are shown to be universal approximators of associative memory models, with diffusion processes as their white-noise perturbations. The universal properties of associative memory that follow are used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise diminishes. Structural stability of Morse-Smale flows -- that is, the robustness of their global critical point structure -- implies the stability of both trajectories and invariant measures for diffusions in the zero-noise limit. The learning and generation landscapes of these models appear as parameterized families of gradient flows and their stochastic perturbations, and the bifurcation theory for Morse-Smale systems implies that they are generically stable except at isolated parameter values, where enumerable sets of local and global bifurcations govern transitions between stable systems in parameter space. These landscapes are thus characterized by ordered bifurcation sequences that create, destroy, or alter connections between rest points and are robust under small stochastic or deterministic perturbations. The framework is agnostic to model formulation, which we verify with examples from energy-based models, denoising diffusion models, and classical and modern Hopfield networks. We additionally derive structural stability criteria for Hopfield-type networks and find that simple cases violate them. Collectively, our geometric approach provides insight into the classification, stability, and emergence of memory and generative landscapes.",

    "content": "arXiv:2505.15813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.",

Ideally, a neural predictive model should account for both of them. Currently, there are no dynamic encoding models that explicitly model a latent state and the entire neuronal response distribution. We address this gap by proposing a probabilistic model that predicts the joint distribution of the neuronal responses from video stimuli and stimulus-independent latent factors. After training and testing our model on mouse V1 neuronal responses, we find that it outperforms video-only models in terms of log-likelihood and achieves improvements in likelihood and correlation when conditioned on responses from other neurons. Furthermore, we find that the learned latent factors strongly correlate with mouse behavior and that they exhibit patterns related to the neurons' position on the visual cortex, although the model was trained without behavior and cortical coordinates. Our findings demonstrate that unsupervised learning of latent factors from population responses can reveal biologically meaningful structure that bridges sensory processing and behavior, without requiring explicit behavioral annotations during training.",

This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.12715v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Scenes are complex, yet structured collections of parts, including objects and surfaces, that exhibit spatial and semantic relations to one another. An effective visual system therefore needs unified scene representations that relate scene parts to their location and their co-occurrence. We hypothesize that this structure can be learned self-supervised from natural experience by exploiting the temporal regularities of active vision: each fixation reveals a locally-detailed glimpse that is statistically related to the previous one via co-occurrence and saccade-conditioned spatial regularities. We instantiate this idea with Glimpse Prediction Networks (GPNs) -- recurrent models trained to predict the feature embedding of the next glimpse along human-like scanpaths over natural scenes. GPNs successfully learn co-occurrence structure and, when given relative saccade location vectors, show sensitivity to spatial arrangement. Furthermore, recurrent variants of GPNs were able to integrate information across glimpses into a unified scene representation. Notably, these scene representations align strongly with human fMRI responses during natural-scene viewing across mid/high-level visual cortex. Critically, GPNs outperform architecture- and dataset-matched controls trained with explicit semantic objectives, and match or exceed strong modern vision baselines, leaving little unique variance for those alternatives.

    "title": "A Stochastic Quantum Neural Network Model for Ai",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.11609v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has drawn significant inspiration from neuroscience to develop artificial neural network (ANN) models. However, these models remain constrained by the Von Neumann architecture and struggle to capture the complexity of the biological brain. Quantum computing, with its foundational principles of superposition, entanglement, and unitary evolution, offers a promising alternative approach to modeling neural dynamics. This paper explores the possibility of a neuro-quantum model of the brain by introducing a stochastic quantum approach that incorporates random fluctuations of neuronal processing within a quantum framework. We propose a mathematical formalization of stochastic quantum neural networks (QNNS), where qubits evolve according to stochastic differential equations inspired by biological neuronal processes. We also discuss challenges related to decoherence, qubit stability, and implications for AI and computational neuroscience.",

    "content": "Models of working memory make fundamentally different commitments to the architecture of individual memories. Information-sparse models conceptualize individual memories as single point estimates agnostic to meta-cognitive variables such as uncertainty. In contrast, information-rich models propose memories are encoded as probability distributions over feature space that embed memory uncertainty in the shape of the distribution. To distinguish these accounts, we constructed probability distributions of memory from participants iterative reports of motion direction on each trial. Remarkably, the idiosyncratic shape of these distributions (e.g., asymmetry) on single trials matched the shape of neural probability distributions decoded from fMRI patterns measured from occipital and parietal cortex. Consistent with information-rich models, the neural representation of an individual memory encodes more than the memorized feature; its variance (i.e., width and asymmetry) encodes idiosyncrasies whose read-out predicts memory behavior.",

    "title": "Subliminal beauty engages the brain's valuation circuits",
    "content": "Neuroeconomic models propose that the anterior ventral striatum (aVS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are key regions for computing subjective value (SV) signals that guide choice. However, the role of conscious awareness in this process remains debated. Here we examined whether SV can be automatically computed in these regions without conscious awareness. In an fMRI experiment, participants viewed faces that varied in attractiveness under three conditions: (i) suppressed from awareness via continuous flash suppression (CFS), (ii) clearly visible without suppression, or (iii) absent (background only) with CFS. Participants reported trial-wise facial identity (objective) and visibility (subjective) measures of facial awareness. In a post-fMRI session, they rated the attractiveness of each face as a measure of SV. When faces were seen, task performance (d') exceeded chance and responses were faster than in absent trials. When faces were unseen, performance was at chance but responses were slower than absent trials. Neurally, seen and unseen faces elicited greater neural signal than absent trials and showed similar neural patterns in the fusiform face area (FFA). Critically, neural signal in vmPFC correlated with SV for both seen and unseen faces, with similar neural patterns. In aVS, SV-related signal was only observed for unseen faces. Furthermore, mean face-related signal in FFA correlated with SV-related signals in aVS and vmPFC for unseen faces. These findings demonstrate that SV can be automatically computed in aVS and vmPFC without conscious awareness, suggesting a neural pathway by which subliminal information can influence value-based choice.",

    "title": "A Unified Neural Timecourse for Words, Phrases, and Sentences: MEG Evidence from Parallel Presentation",
    "content": "Recent behavioral and neural research on reading shows that humans can extract syntactic structure from short sentences within a fraction of a second - faster than many estimates for recognizing the meaning of a single word. This challenges a core assumption of many language processing models: that combinatory operations depend on prior lexical access. Further, studies using parallel presentation of full sentences have revealed electrophysiological responses remarkably similar to those well established for single words. This raises the question of whether words, phrases, and sentences all move through the same processing stages, regardless of syntactic complexity. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examined how single words, phrases, and sentences are processed when all visual information is available at once. Across all three levels, we observed highly similar waveform dynamics, with early responses reflecting bottom-up detection of form followed by activity in the left anterior and posterior temporal cortices and vmPFC consistent with combinatory processing. Of these regions, the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) showed effects of bigram frequency suggestive of serial left-to-right dynamics. Together, these results support a Global-to-Serial Assembly (GLOSA) model in which the brain first detects the global form of the stimulus in a snapshot-like manner and then probes its combinatory properties through partially serial processes.",

    "content": "Population receptive field (pRF) modelling is a ubiquitous tool in sensory neuroscience for estimating the functional architecture of the human brain. Most pRF models assume a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) to account for neurovascular effects. But how does this assumption affect results in practice? Here, we concurrently fit the HRF within the pRF model. Using simulations, we demonstrate that this algorithm accurately identifies different ground truth HRFs used for generating data. Moreover, concurrent fitting improves the accuracy of pRF estimates, especially with complex models. Next, we reanalyzed empirical datasets with different stimulus paradigms and scanning parameters. Concurrent fitting substantially reduced the proportion of implausibly small pRFs. Importantly, the best-fitting HRF differed substantially from canonical HRFs or from those measured independently. HRFs also peaked earlier in higher than early visual cortex, suggesting response nonlinearities. All these differences could produce spurious pRF estimates and alter the interpretation of reported findings.",

    "title": "Chewing phase - theta amplitude coupling facilitates working memory",
    "content": "Rhythmic chewing enhances cognitive performance, yet the neural mechanisms linking oromotor behavior to cortical dynamics remain poorly understood, in part due to motion artifacts that obscure brain signals. We used high-density EEG with a custom artifact attenuation pipeline to examine how mastication shapes frontocentral theta oscillations during working memory.Thirty one participants performed a visuospatial 2-back task under two conditions: at rest and while chewing. Chewing resulted in faster responses and a selective increase in theta power (4-7 Hz) during the late post-stimulus window (900-1300 ms), a phase associated with cognitive control. Theta amplitude was modulated by the chewing phase, revealing strong cross-frequency coupling between motor output and neural oscillations. The strength of this entrainment increased with chewing frequency, indicating a dose-dependent neural gain. Our results demonstrate that peripheral rhythmic activity can synchronize brain rhythms relevant to cognition in real time, supporting a mechanistic link between bodily action and executive function. These findings enhance our understanding of sensorimotor cognitive integration and point to natural motor rhythms as promising non-invasive tools for modulating brain activity.",

    "title": "Degraded neural coding of temporal fine structure with age predicts effortful listening in multi-talker environments",
    "content": "Middle age represents a critical window for early detection of neurophysiological decline. Hearing loss is increasingly recognized as both an early marker of neural degeneration and a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Yet many adults report difficulty understanding speech in noise despite normal audiograms, highlighting the limitations of current clinical tests that fail to capture the underlying physiology or effort required for real-world listening. Beyond hearing thresholds, speech comprehension in complex environments depends on precise neural encoding of temporal fine structure (TFS) cues that convey pitch and spatial information. Here, we use a noninvasive EEG-based measure of neural phase-locking (frequency modulation following responses or FMFRs) to quantify TFS encoding in young and middle-aged adults with normal hearing thresholds. Middle-aged listeners exhibited reduced FMFR amplitudes and shallower discriminability slopes, reflecting diminished neural synchrony despite preserved hearing thresholds. Using a multi-talker speech task we further found that pupil-indexed listening effort was significantly greater in middle-aged adults despite matched accuracy across groups. Further, increases in listening effort were predicted by decreases in TFS encoding. Together, these results reveal that degraded neural encoding of TFS underlies subclinical listening difficulties and increased cognitive load, establishing the FMFR as a sensitive biomarker of hidden auditory neural decline.",

    "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential tool for assessing the neural activity behind mental fatigue, a factor that can influence both cognitive and physical performance. Mental fatigue influences alpha-band oscillations (8 to 12 Hz), reflecting cortical engagement and attention stability. In this study, EEG recordings from 109 participants in the Physionet open-source EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset (EEGMMIDB) were analyzed to characterize alpha power changes during sustained attention. Spectral analysis was performed across early and late task blocks to quantify alpha desynchronization over time. Participants demonstrated a consistent decrease in alpha power ( = -0.076 +/- 0.019 log10 units; p = 0.0001), indicating desynchronization associated with sustained attentional demand. These findings show the applicability of open-source EEG datasets for research.

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The emergence of functional sensory modalities requires precise cortical arealization and thalamocortical connectivity. While early morphogen gradients broadly initiate cortical patterning, how sensory identity is specified and refined within these territories remains unclear. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we reveal distinct modality-specific identity genes in primary somatosensory and visual cortices at early stages. These genes are enriched in thalamo-recipient layers and linked to neuronal activity and cell adhesion. Disrupting early thalamic activity alters both cortical activity and the expression of a subset of these genes, demonstrating a causal role for thalamic input in sensory modality acquisition. Remarkably, a core set of identity genes is already differentially expressed embryonically, before thalamic innervation, and encodes cell-adhesion profiles matching those of sensory thalamus, potentially enabling homophilic interactions. Our findings support a two-step model: cortical cell-adhesion codes prime modality-specific thalamocortical targeting, which is subsequently refined by patterned thalamic activity to establish functional cortical modalities.",

    "content": "Psilocybin induces profound alterations in consciousness, yet prevailing neural models often describe a monolithic change in brain connectivity that may not fully capture the multifaceted nature of the psychedelic state. To test the hypothesis of a composite neural state, this study applied a robust, data-driven framework, Connectome Independent Component Analysis (connICA) with multi-level resampling, to resting-state fMRI data from healthy volunteers. The analysis decomposed connectomes into statistically independent functional connectivity traits (\"FC-Traits\"), revealing a primary trait whose expression was significantly modulated by plasma psilocin concentration, providing a whole-cortical signature of the drug's physiological action. Crucially, a second, distinct trait was also isolated, which independently associated with impaired performance on a visual divergent thinking task. These findings demonstrate that the acute psilocybin state is a composite of co-occurring neural processes. This validates the application of a decompositional connectomic framework to move beyond global descriptions and successfully disentangle the specific neural patterns underlying distinct pharmacological and cognitive correlates.",

    "title": "Connecting the dots - Recognition of artificial and natural shapes relies on representing points of high information",
    "content": "Physiological and psychophysical evidence suggests that the visual system represents object outlines based on prominent curvature features, in particular regions of extreme curvature (such as convex maxima and concave minima). Curvature extrema often coincide with points of high information content (surprisal, in information-theoretic terms). However, this relationship is only correlational. To date, no study has directly compared the role of curvature extrema with the role of surprisal itself. Does the visual system selectively encode curvature extrema because they tend to be informative-because they are heuristic proxies for high-surprisal points along the contour-or does it directly encode informative points that happen often to be located at curvature extrema? We addressed this question in a series of shape-matching experiments, testing how curvature extrema and information content contribute to recognition. Observers (N = 7) matched a smooth test shape to one of two re-scaled shapes (target and distractor) constructed by connecting, with straight lines, points corresponding to (i) curvature maxima, (ii) both curvature maxima and minima, or (iii) points of maximum surprisal. A baseline condition used identical test and target shapes. Stimuli included artificial shapes composed of compound radial frequency patterns and natural shapes (animal outlines), the latter enabling us to disentangle curvature and information effects by restricting sampled points. Recognition performance was higher for natural than artificial shapes (95% vs. ~86%). Performance for shapes containing a few points of high information matched performance on trials containing all curvature extrema and baseline trials. It also exceeded performance for shapes with curvature maxima alone (65% vs. ~90%). These findings suggest that shape representation emphasizes features with high informational content rather than curvature extrema per se.",

Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "title": "Micro-/nano-plastics accentuate Parkinson's Disease-relevant phenotypes in a Drosophila model",
    "content": "Micro- and nano-plastic (MNP) particles are a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that are increasingly bioaccumulating in human tissues, particularly the brain. MNPs induce mitochondrial defects, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and neurotoxicity in cellular and organismal models. This raises the possibility that MNP exposure could cause or exacerbate neurological conditions associated with these pathological phenomena. Parkinson's Disease (PD), a common movement disorder characterised by degeneration of striatal dopaminergic neurons, and associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, represents such a condition. We therefore hypothesised that MNP exposure might interact with PD risk mutations affecting mitochondrial fidelity. We used a fruit fly model of PRKN-dependent PD associated with defects in mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control pathway, to test this hypothesis. We found that ingestion of MNPs at concentrations tolerated by wild-type controls selectively enhanced PD-relevant phenotypes - including progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration, movement defects, and sleep disruption - in this model of PD. Our data suggest that defects in mitochondrial quality control can increase vulnerability to MNP exposure, and more broadly, that MNPs may synergistically interact with existing genetic risk factors to worsen neurological disease.",

    "content": "Error recognition is fundamental to adaptive behavior, enabling rapid compensatory action when outcomes deviate from expectations. Central to this function are neural circuits for performance monitoring, encoding cognitive signals that could support more reliable neural interfaces. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in epilepsy patients to enable a motor brain-computer interface (BCI) while sampling error-related activity across a distributed network. Our work reveals high-frequency population dynamics emerging in the anterior insula and propagating to the prefrontal cortex as the interface fails to follow the user's intention. We identify spatially organized insular responses to error processing and movement feedback, highlighting it as a heterogeneous hub linking action and outcome. Real-time integration of error responses enables a self-correcting neural interface that enhances usability by reducing the need for manual user intervention. Together, our work demonstrates a human intracranial BCI harnessing insular brain activity, integrating cognitive processes directly into device control.",

    "title": "An inhibitory feedback circuit mediating sleep need and sensory gating in Drosophila",
    "content": "Many animals integrate sensory information during the day and sleep at night. How sensory processing during wakefulness contributes to making an organism tired at night, however, remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of excitatory helicon cells in Drosophila (ExR1), a distinct neural population dedicated to processing sensory information. Using combined optogenetics and voltage imaging, we show that helicon cells excite sleep-promoting R3m ring neurons and trigger a subsequent autoinhibition of R3m via voltage- and Ca2+-gated K+ channels such as Slowpoke. Investigating the flies' sleep patterns, we found that blocking synaptic output from helicon as well as RNAi-mediated knockdown of Slowpoke in R3m reduces sleep quality and leads to loss of nocturnal sleep, indicating that sleep need is generated via this route. Further, we show that excitation of R3m induces feedback inhibition of helicon cells via ionotropic GABA receptors. Knockdown of the ionotropic GABA receptor subunit Rdl in helicon cells increases sleep latency and causes sleep loss at the beginning of the night. We show that inhibition via Rdl facilitates nocturnal slow-wave activity which forms a sensory filter and prevents sleep disruption through auditory stimuli. We therefore uncover an inhibitory feedback circuit, in which neurons processing sensory information directly activate sleep promoting neurons to generate sleep need. At night, this sleep need is then converted into actual sleep, facilitated by the formation of a neural filter that stabilizes sleep/wake transition.",

    "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
    "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

    "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
    "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

    "title": "Distinct prior expectations shape tactile and proprioceptive localization",
    "content": "When a mosquito lands on your finger, swatting it away requires your brain to calculate its location in the external space, which depends on the body's 3D posture. Two competing hypotheses explain how the brain solves this challenge: the integration hypothesis, where tactile signals are transformed into spatial coordinates by integrating touch and posture information; and the cueing hypothesis, where touch merely cues a location on the body whose position is specified via proprioception. Adjudicating between these hypotheses is nearly impossible without modeling the latent factors underlying somatosensory spatial perception. We fill this gap in the present study. We first formalized each hypothesis from a Bayesian perspective: If touch merely triggers proprioceptive localization (cueing hypothesis), tactile and proprioceptive localization should rely on the same Bayesian computations, with identical prior expectations about the mosquito's spatial location; If they involve distinct Bayesian computational processes (integration hypothesis), distinct prior expectations may shape tactile and proprioceptive localization. To test these predictions, we had nineteen participants localize either proprioceptive or tactile targets on their fingertips. We then fit their data with several Bayesian models of each hypothesis. Models allowing different prior distributions between modalities provided the best fit for most participants, with 17 out of 19 participants showing significantly different prior distributions across modalities. These provide strong computational evidence that tactile and proprioceptive localization rely on distinct computational mechanisms, a conclusion that has important implications for how we understand these everyday behaviors and their neural mechanisms.",

    "content": "Neuronal avalanches are sequences of neural activations that exhibit scale-invariant statistics, suggesting neural activity operates near a critical point. Theoretical studies proposed that the balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I), along with neuromodulation, are key factors influencing this critical behavior. Here, we performed in-vivo studies to investigate the role of E and I neurons in generating neuronal avalanches in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae. For this, we used double-transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing cell-type-specific fluorescent proteins and GCaMP6f, combined with immunostaining and selective-plane illumination microscopy to monitor spontaneous neuronal activity and neurotransmitter identity. We found that neural activity approached criticality at balanced E-I ratios but became disordered when E-I ratios were imbalanced. A stochastic network model operating at a critical point, where excitation and inhibition couplings are balanced and balanced amplification drives network avalanches, successfully reproduced the observed statistics of neuronal avalanches and their dependence on E-I ratio fluctuations.",

    "title": "Mislocalisation of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm of either neurons or oligodendrocytes causes axonopathy and dysmyelination",
    "content": "Neurons with large, myelinated axons are vulnerable to degeneration across the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) frontotemporal dementia (FTD) disease spectrum. The defining molecular pathology of this spectrum is mislocalisation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Even though cytoplasmic TDP-43 is prevalent in neurons and oligodendrocytes, how these molecular pathologies contribute to neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we developed humanised zebrafish in which we restricted TDP-43 to the cytoplasm of either neurons or oligodendrocytes. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 restricted to neurons led to a severe axonopathy, with extreme distal axonal swelling and reduced myelination. Axonopathy was mirrored by cell type specific loss of TDP-43 function from neurons, pointing to loss of function, rather than a toxic gain of function of mislocalised TDP-43, as driving this phenotype. Preventing oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination when TDP-43 was mislocalised in neurons exacerbated axonopathy, indicating that oligodendrocytes limit neurodegeneration. Indeed, when TDP-43 was mislocalised to the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes this also led to axonopathy and reduced myelination, pointing to complex contributions of neurons and oligodendrocytes to neurodegeneration.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Vectorial boundary representation of 3D layout in human visual cortex",
    "content": "Human spatial navigation relies on the brains ability to visually represent the 3D layout of the environment. To understand how the brain encodes the layout information, it is crucial to identify the key features of environmental layout and how they are processed in the human brain. The vector coding principle, which highlight the role of boundary distance and orientation, provides a theoretical framework supported by physiological evidence from rodents. In this study, we developed a reconstruction approach to quantitatively estimate 3D layout information from natural indoor scene images. This approach enabled analyses of fMRI data from the large-scale Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) using vector-based models of 3D layout. To validate the NSD-based results and examine task-related dynamics, we further conducted fMRI and MEG experiments with navigation-related and non-navigational tasks. Controlling for low-, mid-, and high-level visual and semantic features of natural indoor scenes, we found a spatiotemporal dissociation between boundary distance and orientation representations in the human brain. Relative distance was encoded in the early visual cortex during early processing in a task-invariant manner, whereas orientation was represented in scene-selective higher visual areas during later processing and was modulated by navigation-related tasks. Importantly, task modulation manifested as feedback-induced enhancement of orientation coding in the early visual cortex. Together, these findings provide a novel perspective on how the human brain represents navigation-relevant information about the immediate surrounding environment, advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms that link perception to action in spatial navigation.",

    "title": "An integrative computational approach for obstacle avoidance during action selection",
    "content": "Action selection in cluttered environments, where individuals must simultaneously pursue goals and avoid obstacles, presents a significant challenge for the brain. To understand the underlying mechanisms of action selection in such contexts, we propose a computational model that extends stochastic optimal control theory through a novel framework for obstacle avoidance. The model decomposes action selection as a weighted combination of individual control policies, each generated for either target approach or obstacle avoidance. By integrating value information from goals, obstacles, and actions into a unified measure of \"relative desirability\", the model dynamically determines the contribution of each policy to the overall action selection process. We evaluated the framework using simulated target-reaching tasks in cluttered environments based on previous human studies. The results showed that the model captures key features of human motor behavior, including the influence of obstacle properties on movement trajectories and the transient tendency to initiate movements toward obstacles before avoidance. This work offers new insights into the dynamic interaction between approach and avoidance behaviors, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding action selection in complex and naturalistic settings.",

    "title": "Active vision modulates early cortical stages of visual processing: Evidence from MEG and eye-tracking",
    "content": "It has been hypothesized that the visual system anticipates upcoming visual input contingent on the execution of saccadic eye movements. In line with this idea, it has been shown that changes in visual input across saccades elicit stronger post-saccadic fixation-locked neural responses compared to no-change conditions; an effect known as the preview effect. In the present study, we demonstrate that this preview effect depends on active vision and cannot be explained by either classical or spatiotopic adaptation. In a gaze-contingent experiment, in which participants were cued to make saccades to object stimuli, we concurrently recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking data. The source-localized MEG signal was deconvolved with stimulus onset and eye movement events in order to account for systematic variation in gaze behavior related to the no-change (valid preview) and change (invalid preview) conditions. Crucially, preview effects in the primary visual and in ventral-occipital cortices were markedly larger when participants made saccades compared to replay blocks in which we simulated the visual consequences of saccades absent saccade execution, demonstrating that the preview effect cannot be simply explained by classic adaptation. A further control condition ruled out spatiotopic adaptation. Our results show that early visual cortical areas which are not known to exhibit saccadic remapping neurons still show signs of sequential neural history effects across saccades. Previous research might have overlooked this influence of active vision because of the lack of an invalid preview condition which breaks the correspondence between pre-saccadic extrafoveal and post-saccadic foveal stimulation.",

You keep your UI; we handle the gnarly parts (recurrence, time zones, DST, conflict-safe bookings).<p>What it does: \u2022 MCP tool: generates typed clients and API route handlers (Next.js/Express/Fastify/Nest) so you can scaffold calls straight from your IDE/agent tooling. \u2022 Availability engine: recurring rules + one-off exceptions/blackouts, returned in a clean, queryable shape. \u2022 Bookings: conflict-safe endpoints for creating/updating/canceling slots.<p>Why we built it: We kept rebuilding the same \"hard parts\" of scheduling: time zones/DST edge cases, recurring availability, conflict-aware booking, etc.\nWe wanted a boring, reliable backend so we could ship product features without adopting a hosted scheduling UI.<p>How it's helped: We stopped re-implementing DST/recurrence math and shipped booking flows faster. One small team (just 2 developers) built a robust booking platform for their business using Kalendis\u2014they kept full control of their UX without spending lots of cycles on scheduling infrastructure. The MCP generator cut the glue code: drop in a typed client or route, call the API, move on.<p>Some tech details: \u2022 REST API with ISO-8601 timestamps and IANA time zones \u2022 Recurring availability + one-off exceptions (designed to compose cleanly) \u2022 Focused scope: users, availability, exceptions, bookings (not a monolithic suite)<p>The MCP server exposes tools like generate-frontend-client, generate-backend-client, generate-api-routes, and list-endpoints. Add to your MCP settings:<p><pre><code>  {\n   \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"kalendis\": {\n     \"command\": \"npx\",\n     \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@kalendis/mcp\"]\n    }\n   }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nHow to try it: Create a free account \u2192 get an API key. (<a href=\"https://kalendis.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kalendis.dev</a>). Then hit an endpoint:<p><pre><code>  curl -H \"x-api-key: $KALENDIS_API_KEY\" \\\n \"https://api.kalendis.dev/v1/availability/getAvailability?userId=&amp;start=2025-10-07T00:00:00Z&amp;end=2025-10-14T00:00:00Z&amp;includeExceptions=true\"\n</code></pre>\nHappy to answer questions and post example snippets in the thread. Thanks for taking a look!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45956154\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45956154</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "Potato leaf diseases pose a serious challenge to global food security, often leading to considerable yield losses if not detected promptly. The growing maturity of deep learning has enabled automated, high-precision plant disease recognition, even on devices with limited computational resources. In this study, several lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) models--MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), EfficientNet-Lite, ShuffleNet, and SqueezeNet--are comparatively assessed for the task of potato leaf disease classification. The models were trained under identical preprocessing and fine-tuning conditions, incorporating checkpoint-based training for stability. Among the evaluated networks, ShuffleNet delivered the highest overall performance with 99% accuracy, 0.97 precision, 0.99 recall, and an F1-score of 0.98, making it well-suited for real-time field deployment. EfficientNet-Lite also demonstrated a strong balance between speed and accuracy (91.9%), outperforming both MobileNet variants. Conversely, SqueezeNet, though the most compact model, recorded lower metrics (76% accuracy), indicating limited feature discrimination capability. This analysis underscores the balance between efficiency, robustness, and predictive accuracy, providing practical insights for deploying deep learning models in precision agriculture and low-resource environments.",

    "content": "Global luciferase reporter gene technology is an important real-time readout for the analysis of circadian oscillations. However, because nearly all cells in the body possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators, developing cell-type-specific reporter systems is essential to dissect how these oscillators interact within complex multicellular tissues and are modulated by brain-body circadian signals. The intestine is a complex organ composed of diverse cell types with distinct origins and functions, and it exhibits robust daily rhythms in physiological activities driven by intrinsic circadian clocks. While the circadian regulation of the mucosal compartment, including the intestinal epithelium, has been relatively well characterized, the mechanisms governing the circadian rhythms in the cells of the muscularis externa remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel Cre-dependent Per2-luciferase reporter mouse that enables precise measurement of circadian oscillations in specific peripheral cell populations ex vivo and demonstrate its utility in revealing the hierarchical circadian chrono-architecture within the intestine. Ex vivo gut explants from mice expressing the reporter in one of five major cell types of the muscularis externa-enteric neurons (ENs), enteric glial cells (EGCs), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and muscularis macrophages (MMs)-exhibited robust, self-sustained circadian bioluminescence rhythms, indicating that all of these cell types possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators. Notably, ENs in the small intestine entrained more rapidly to feeding schedules than did those in the colon, revealing regional differences in food entrainment among the gut clocks. Moreover, the clocks of ENs, SMCs, and MMs shifted their phase in response to daytime-restricted feeding, whereas ICC clocks remained unaffected even after three weeks of restricted feeding. These findings demonstrate that distinct intestinal cell types possess unique entrainment properties and that feeding rhythms can induce heterogeneous phase shifts within the gut clocks. Given that circadian disruption, such as that caused by shift work, contributes to intestinal disorders, this reporter system could provide a powerful platform to dissect the mechanisms linking intercellular circadian desynchrony to intestinal homeostasis.",

    "title": "Dynamic interactions in human amygdala subregions support hierarchical processing of fearful faces",
    "content": "Fearful-expression recognition is vital for survival, relying on rapid fear detection and fine-grained face encoding. However, how human amygdala subregions differentially implement these distinct cognitive components remains unclear. Here, we recorded intracranial EEG from lateral and medial amygdala in epilepsy patients performing an emotional face-matching task, and combined multivariate decoding, time-frequency and directed-connectivity analyses with intracranial stimulation. We found that the lateral subregion exhibited early, fear-specific theta/alpha-band (4-12 Hz) activity with higher decoding accuracy and directed transfer of fear-specific information to the medial subregion, which showed delayed and sustained activation. By contrast, the medial subregion encoded face-specific information at a later stage in the 2-16 Hz band with superior decoding accuracy, and then relayed this information back to the lateral subregion. Critically, intracranial stimulation yielded double-dissociable behavioural effects, with lateral stimulation disrupting early fear detection while medial stimulation accelerated neutral-face recognition. Together, our study delineates a hierarchically organized, temporally structured division of labour within the human amygdala and show that dynamic interactions underlie hierarchical processing of fearful expressions.",

    "title": "Eigenmode decomposition of asymmetries in whole-brain effective connectivity reveals multiscale hierarchical dynamics",
    "content": "The human brain is a complex, hierarchical system operating far from equilibrium, yet the mechanisms linking its directed network architecture to temporal irreversibility remain largely unknown. While prior studies have revealed functional and structural hierarchies, no framework has captured the hierarchical organization of the brain's directed network in relation to its non-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we present the first large-scale eigendecomposition of whole-brain effective connectivity (EC), estimated from resting-state fMRI using sparse Dynamic Causal Modeling. We isolate the irreversible component of EC, which encodes the directionality of information flow and forms a comprehensive hierarchical network of forward and backward interactions. This hierarchy strengthens in brain states approaching criticality, where slow, oscillatory modes dominate and reflects the influence of long-range anatomical connections that scaffold whole-brain information flow. Our decomposition provides the first multiscale quantification of temporal irreversibility, revealing dual counterpropagating streams along the unimodal-transmodal axis operating at distinct frequencies. Crucially, these hierarchical dynamics carry robust, individual-specific signatures, with unimodal networks contributing disproportionately to subject identifiability. Altogether, this work delivers the first dynamic, whole-brain characterization of effective connectivity-derived hierarchies across spatiotemporal scales and individuals, offering a unified framework for studying brain hierarchy, non-equilibrium dynamics, and subject identifiability.",

    "content": "With the emergence of gene and optogenetic therapies targeting deafness, the comprehensive analysis of the molecular anatomy and physiology of the cochlea has become ever more important. Here, we introduce CochleaNet, a deep learning-based framework to analyze volumetric imaging data obtained by light-sheet microscopy of decalcified, cleared and fluorescently labeled cochleae. CochleaNet covers the workflow from reconstruction of the cochlea to segmentation of inner hair cells, spiral ganglion neurons and their afferent synapses, to analyzing the expression of gene therapy products. We validated CochleaNet by comparison to manual image analysis. Trained on high isotropic resolution mouse data, CochleaNet was also applicable to the cochlea of the gerbil, another relevant animal model, and lower-resolution mouse data from a commercially available microscope. We conclude that the combination of light-sheet microscopy and image analysis with CochleaNet paves the way for rapid and reliable quantification of cochlear molecular anatomy and preclinical gene therapy outcomes.",

    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Structural MRI provides a noninvasive window into brain morphology, yet the reproducibility and interpretability of morphometric analyses remain limited by inconsistent preprocessing, variable spatial alignment, and heterogeneous feature construction. We introduce MORPH2DIAG, a fully automated, atlas-free morphometric pipeline that integrates standardized preprocessing, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, data-driven subtyping, and machine- and deep-learning classification within a single, modular framework. The pipeline performs intensity normalization, morphological cleanup, PCA-informed affine alignment, isotropic rescaling, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) segmentation to generate quantitative gray-matter (GM), white-matter (WM), and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) maps. Global tissue fractions were used to derive latent neuroanatomical subtypes via unsupervised K-means clustering, revealing progressive GM--CSF gradients consistent with patterns commonly observed along normative-to-atrophic structural continua observed in neurodegeneration. To capture finer-grained spatial heterogeneity, a voxel-wise K-means parcellation yielded parcel-level intensity means and variances that served as regional morphometric descriptors. These global and parcel-level features were integrated into a unified evaluation suite comparing classical machine learning models (Random Forests, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) with lean, deep, and hybrid multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) trained using focal loss, label smoothing, stochastic weight averaging, and nested cross-validation with PCA-based dimensionality reduction. Across methods, the hybrid MLP achieved the highest macro-F1 and balanced accuracy, demonstrating strong discriminative performance for the discovered morphometric subtypes. Collectively, MORPH2DIAG establishes a fully automated, atlas-free framework that unites unsupervised structural subtype discovery with interpretable machine and deep learning, providing a reproducible foundation for MRI-based morphometric profiling and automated detection of neurodegenerative-like patterns.",

    "title": "The cost of dual-task walking: cognitive demands restrict visual search and gait planning",
    "content": "Adaptive walking relies on proactive visual search to plan foot placement and maintain stability. This study examined how cognitive load and task complexity affect gaze behaviour and gait biomechanics during a precision target-stepping task in healthy young adults. We also quantified the frequency of cross-stepping during the experimental task. Twenty-three participants (18-23 years) walked along an L-shaped pathway containing raised stepping targets under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. Targets had four different layouts to create high and low difficulty conditions. Eye movements were recorded using mobile eye-tracking, and gait kinematics were captured via motion capture. Compared with ST, DT walking produced slower walking speeds, longer stance times, and reduced velocity between stepping targets, indicating a more inefficient gait strategy. Eye-tracking analyses revealed fewer and shorter fixations on task-relevant targets and a greater number of fixations directed toward task-irrelevant areas under DT conditions. In DT, saccadic amplitudes were reduced despite increased outside fixations, suggesting a breakdown in visual exploration between proximal and distal regions of the walkway. Cross-stepping was more frequent in ST conditions than in DT. These findings indicate that increased cognitive load compromises proactive visual search, likely through working-memory and attentional limitations that disrupt feedforward gait planning. Contrary to expectation, cross-stepping occurred more often during ST than DT walking, suggesting that in this population cross-stepping may not be a maladaptive strategy. Overall, these results highlight the cognitive demands of adaptive walking even in young, low-risk individuals and underscore the importance of preserving visual-motor coordination under cognitive stress.",

    "title": "A Load-Induced Energetic Tipping Point Explains Selective Vulnerability of Substantia Nigra Neurons",
    "content": "Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are selectively vulnerable in Parkinson's disease, while closely related neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are comparatively spared. Although mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium stress, and -synuclein aggregation have each been implicated, none alone explains why anatomically similar populations exhibit such different fates. Here we develop a minimal two-variable energetic model that captures only mitochondrial functional capacity, energetic reserve, and the combined load from axonal arborization and calcium handling. Despite its simplicity, the model reveals that increasing structural load deforms the energetic landscape until a saddle-node bifurcation emerges, producing coexisting healthy-energy and collapsed-energy states. SNc-like neurons, which bear extreme axonal and calcium-handling demands, reside inside this bistable regime, operating near a separatrix that renders them vulnerable to even modest metabolic perturbations. In contrast, VTA-like neurons lie outside the bistable window and robustly return to their high-energy state following similar disturbances. The model reproduces hallmark features of Parkinsonian degeneration - long periods of stability, sudden irreversible collapse, and population-specific susceptibility - using only the geometry of load-dependent energy regulation. These findings suggest that selective SNc vulnerability arises not from unique molecular defects, but from the fundamental dynamical structure imposed by their extraordinary anatomical and physiological load.",

    "content": "How can humans manage multiple sources of information competing for attention? To approach this question, we adopted a multi-dimensional task-set interference paradigm that requires individuals to handle distractions from three independent dimensions. Behavioral results suggest that people track prior interference from each dimension to selectively modulate their attentional gain. Testing the mechanism of this adaptation at the neural level requires measuring multi-dimensional task representations. To achieve this, we applied representational similarity analyses and encoding models to human EEG and investigated how the history of interference simultaneously affected the time-resolved representations of target and distractor dimensions. EEG analyses revealed that target and distractor features are initially encoded in parallel, but distractors are rapidly suppressed around 250 ms, with suppression scaling with prior interference. Proactive task-level control enhanced the efficiency of this reactive suppression, without producing sustained preparatory changes. Behavioral and neural effects converged to show that dimension-specific interference and adaptation are associated with the speed of visual integration of each dimension, as captured by a connectionist model with temporal integration. Altogether, these results suggest that proactive control mechanisms operate on the speed and efficiency of a reactive suppression mechanism that constrains selective distractor representations from biasing the response process.",

    "content": "The ability to recognize odor identity across a wide range of concentrations is essential for natural olfactory behaviors However how odor identity is represented in the early olfactory system remains an open question One theory proposes that glomeruli in the olfactory bulb along with their associated odorant receptors ORs are activated by odorants in a temporal order that conveys information about odor identity This order code is relatively robust to concentration changes as the rank order of glomerular activation by a given odorant remains similar across concentrations Alternatively the primacy coding theory suggests that odor identity is defined by the most sensitive ORs those that respond first collectively referred to as the primacy set To test these theories we measured glomerular responses to a large set of odorants in the mouse olfactory bulb using calcium imaging We found that receptor affinities can be embedded in a lowdimensional space D 10 with minimal loss of information Within this space we identified two clusters of glomeruli with distinct tuning properties that form independent odor representations These clusters may correspond to the two phylogenetic classes of ORs as revealed by both their functional characteristics and anatomical locations In the OR affinity space odorants evoke orderly activation waves whose directions can be used to define odor identities in the order coding model Finally we compared the order code and primacy model in predicting odor identity both across concentrations and across animals Despite containing less information overall the primacy model performed comparably to the order code We confirmed the primacy models prediction that each receptor tends to contribute to the primacy set of at least one odorant Analysis of binary odor mixtures revealed that mixture responses lie along geodesic lines connecting their component odors Together these findings suggest that odor information in the olfactory bulb may be represented through two complementary coding strategies the primacy and order codes.",

    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "The Richness of Vision in the Mammalian Brain: Neural Codes for Visual Perception and Behavior in Three Dimensions",
    "content": "<p>Successful navigation and interactions with objects in a complex, three-dimensional (3D) world are essential to survival, yet studies of the neural basis of visual perception and action often treat the world as a flat, two-dimensional (2D) canvas. Here, we review recent discoveries about how the visual systems of different mammals have adapted under the constraint of a 3D world. Many neurons in primate visual cortex are sensitive to 3D depth cues constructed from input differences to the two eyes (binocular disparities). Similar neuronal selectivity has recently been characterized in tree shrews and mice, though constrained anatomically and functionally. Disparity-sensitive receptive field structures can now be assessed noninvasively across human visual cortex and functionally linked to depth perception. At later stages in the nonhuman primate (NHP) ventral (\"what\") pathway, supporting object recognition, complex 3D objects are represented as spatial configurations of geometric parts. In studies of the dorsal (\"where\"/\"how\") pathway of NHPs, underlying visuospatial processing, the inclusion of 3D structure in visual tasks has established tighter links between neuronal mechanisms and perception. This has also revealed neuronal representations of 3D object position and orientation that are tolerant to 3D gaze location, providing a basis for robust perception and action. The cross-species analysis presented here provides new perspectives on neural coding mechanisms underpinning the richness of 3D visual experience. Elucidation of these mechanisms will be essential for understanding the neural basis of cognition and behavior, which in turn will enable the development of therapies and neuroprosthetics for those suffering from visual impairments.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is essential for monitoring ongoing behavior, regulating affect, and guiding social interactions. Altered ACC structure and function are implicated in a host of psychiatric disorders, most notably major depressive disorder. Thus, cross talk between basic and translational research is needed to drive the next generation of treatments. The human and nonhuman primate ACC is large and can be subdivided based on anatomical structure and connectivity. Increasingly, studies of the ACC point to unique functions for its distinct areas. This review highlights recent work aimed at understanding of the structure and function of distinct portions of the ACC and the role of these regions in cognition and affect in higher species. We focus on the roles and subregions that might guide the development of treatments for psychiatric disorders. This includes discussion of in-depth anatomical investigations that have revealed that distinct portions of the subgenual and perigenual ACC areas are driven by unique afferent paths. Furthermore, we describe neurophysiological recordings of single-neuron and local field potential activity, combined with carefully designed behavioral tasks or novel approaches to discerning affective states, which have revealed the neural mechanisms engaged in ACC during affective experience and assessment of conspecifics. We present noninvasive and invasive neuromodulation approaches that target the ACC to treat depression and have been shown to be most effective when they change activity within subgenual parts of ACC and may structurally remodel the connections of this area. Finally, we review new approaches to uncover upstream drivers and downstream effectors of ACC activity in higher species, including functional changes implicated in health, disease, and recovery.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Pain is a symptom common to a wide variety of conditions and one that severely impacts an individual's everyday life, as well as having broader socioeconomic repercussions. In recent years, there has been spectacularly rapid progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of sensory neuron function and pain in preclinical models. However, the number of analgesics interacting with novel targets that have received regulatory approval in recent years has been limited. Examples include monoclonal antibody and small molecule therapies disrupting calcitonin gene-related peptide signaling for treating migraine and, most recently, suzetrigine, a small molecular inhibitor of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 subunit. In this review, we step away from focusing on the sensory neuron as the transmitter of nociceptive information and examine the role of non-neuronal cells in modulating sensory neuron activity. One potential appeal of disrupting the activity of peripherally located non-neuronal cells is the likely bypassing of side effects associated with modulating a target receptor that is expressed by neurons within both the peripheral and central nervous systems, although targeting of peripheral, non-neuronal cells will not of course necessarily be side effect-free. Here, we examine the key roles of non-neuronal cells in orchestrating pain across a diverse set of conditions, from joint pain to bone pain, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, Fabry disease, and chronic pain in general.</p>",

This review synthesizes recent insights from rodent research presented at our 2025 Society for Neuroscience minisymposium, detailing how local inhibitory microcircuits, long-range projection&ndash;defined pathways, and neuromodulatory inputs interact to shape fear, anxiety, and reward behaviors. We emphasize how distinct circuits segregate fear and anxiety, resolve approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts, and integrate reward history. Serotonergic modulation, particularly from the median raphe, emerges as a critical regulator of vHPC dynamics, with pronounced sex-specific functional implications. Finally, we examine how vCA1 ensemble activity encodes emotionally salient stimuli and supports latent state inference, thereby enabling flexible decision-making under uncertainty. Collectively, these findings recast the vHPC as a modular, computationally rich structure essential for adaptive behavior, which may provide new insights into circuit-level dysfunction in affective disorders.</p>",

This process involved not only increased cortical surface area and neuronal output but also enhanced structural adaptations, such as cortical folding and glial morphological complexity. In this review, we examine the central roles of radial glia (RG) and astrocytes in driving neocortical expansion and evolution. We highlight the emergence of primate- and human-specific genes, which contribute to enhanced RG proliferation and neurogenesis in these species. We further explore how epigenetic regulation and dynamic chromatin architecture modulate RG behavior across species. At the cellular level, we discuss how morphological features&mdash;particularly the basal processes and specialized protrusions of RG&mdash;facilitate access to diverse extrinsic signals, promoting proliferative capacity and cortical complexity. We then turn to cortical folding, focusing on the role of astrocytes, and the functional relevance of folds in supporting brain homeostasis. Finally, we address astrocyte diversity, development, and evolutionary adaptation, with special emphasis on sex differences and primate-specific features. Comparative transcriptomic and morphological studies reveal that human astrocytes exhibit unique molecular signatures, expanded metabolic capacity, and higher morphological complexity. Together, these insights underscore the multifaceted contributions of RG and astrocytes to the evolutionary elaboration of the neocortex. They further provide a framework for understanding how cellular innovations shaped the modern primate brain in general, and human brain specifically.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Shank3 is an autism spectrum disorder-associated postsynaptic scaffold protein that links glutamate receptors to trafficking and signaling networks within the postsynaptic density. Shank3 is required for synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic plasticity that bidirectionally modulates postsynaptic strength to stabilize neuronal activity. Shank3 undergoes activity-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at S1586/S1615, and dephosphorylation at these sites is critical for enabling synaptic upscaling. Here, we probe the molecular machinery downstream of Shank3 dephosphorylation that allows for synaptic upscaling in cultured rat neurons of either sex. We first show that a phosphomimetic mutant of Shank3 has reduced binding ability and interaction with long-form Homer1, a postsynaptic protein also crucial for scaling and a known binding partner of Shank3. Since metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been shown to associate with Shank3 through long-form Homer1, we manipulated mGluR1 and mGluR5 signaling with either noncompetitive or competitive inhibitors and found that only competitive inhibition (which targets agonist-dependent signaling) impairs synaptic upscaling. Furthermore, we found that mGluR5 activation rescues synaptic upscaling in the presence of phosphomimetic Shank3 and thus is downstream of Shank3 phosphorylation. Finally, we identify signaling pathways downstream of Group I mGluRs that are necessary for upscaling. Altogether, these data show that activity-dependent dephosphorylation of Shank3 remodels the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR signaling pathway to favor agonist-dependent mGluR signaling, which is necessary to enable synaptic upscaling. More broadly, because downscaling is thought to require agonist-independent mGluR5 signaling, these findings demonstrate that synaptic up- and downscaling rely on distinct functional configurations of the same signaling elements.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Music makes people move. This human propensity to coordinate movement with musical rhythm requires multiscale temporal integration, allowing fast sensory events composing rhythmic input to be mapped onto slower, behavior-relevant, internal templates such as periodic beats. Relatedly, beat perception has been shown to involve an enhanced representation of the beat periodicities in neural activity. However, the extent to which this ability to move to the beat and the related \"periodized\" neural representation are shared across the senses beyond audition remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question by recording separately the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses and finger tapping to a rhythm conveyed either through acoustic or tactile inputs in healthy volunteers of either sex. The EEG responses to the acoustic rhythm, spanning a low-frequency range (below 15&nbsp;Hz), showed enhanced representation of the perceived periodic beat, compatible with behavior. In contrast, the EEG responses to the tactile rhythm, spanning a broader frequency range (up to 25&nbsp;Hz), did not show significant beat-related periodization and yielded less stable tapping. Together, these findings suggest a preferential role of low-frequency neural activity in supporting neural representation of the beat. Most importantly, we show that this neural representation, as well as the ability to move to the beat, is not systematically shared across the senses. More generally, these results, highlighting multimodal differences in beat processing, reveal a process of multiscale temporal integration that allows the auditory system to go beyond mere tracking of onset timing and to support higher-level internal representation and motor entrainment to rhythm.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Spontaneous thoughts, occupying much of one's awake time in daily life, are often colored by emotional qualities. While spontaneous thoughts have been associated with various neural correlates, the relationship between subjective qualities of ongoing experiences and the brain's sensitivity to bodily signals (i.e., interoception) remains largely unexplored. Given the well-established role of interoception in emotion, clarifying this relationship may elucidate how processes relevant to mental health, such as arousal and anxiety, are regulated. We used EEG and ECG to measure the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), an index of interoceptive processing, while 51 adult participants (34 males, 20 females) visually fixated on a cross image and let their minds wander freely. At pseudorandom intervals, participants reported their momentary level of arousal. This measure of affective arousal was highly variable within and between individuals but was statistically unrelated to several markers of physiological arousal, including the heart rate, heart rate variability, time on task, and EEG alpha power at posterior electrodes. A cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that the HEP amplitude was increased during low relative to high affective arousal in a set of frontal electrodes during the 340&ndash;356&nbsp;ms window after heartbeat onset. This HEP effect was more pronounced in individuals who reported high, relative to low, levels of trait anxiety. Together, our results offer novel evidence that at varying levels of trait anxiety, the brain differentially modulates sensitivity to bodily signals in coordination with the momentary, spontaneous experience of affective arousal&mdash;a mechanism that may operate independently of physiological arousal.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Diverse network oscillations, thought to represent different information processing modes of cortical networks, are accompanied by synchronous neuronal activity at various temporal scales. Sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations, supporting memory consolidation in the hippocampus, are among the fastest physiological oscillations characterized by strong interneuronal synchrony. In contrast, when hippocampal activity turns epileptic, pathological fast-ripple oscillations appear. The distinction of the two oscillations is diagnostically relevant; however, how differential mechanisms of the same network generate the two activities is not well understood. Here we addressed this question using an in vitro hippocampal model that allowed targeted recording of cell types and local pharmacological manipulations in mice of either sex. We showed that inhibition did not contribute to current and rhythm generation of fast-ripples, unlike physiological ripple oscillations. Instead, pathological fast-ripples emerged when perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing basket cells collapsed and depended on the quasi-simultaneous onset of stereotypical pyramidal cell (PC) bursts leading to pseudosynchrony. This was accompanied by a loss of spatial coherence. In epileptogenic conditions, deep CA3 PCs selectively ramped up their burst activity before fast-ripple onset, while normally nonbursting superficial PCs acquired burst capability. These results point to PC pseudosynchrony as the underlying mechanism of fast-ripples, with differential contribution of known PC types.</p>",

    "title": "Simultaneous Triple Modes of Cross-Frequency Coupling in Brainstem Nonlinear Oscillator Networks: Cooperative Rhythms of Respiration, Heartbeat, and Brainwaves",
    "content": "Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been proposed as a fundamental mechanism mediating communication between neuronal assemblies through rhythmic interactions across multiple frequency bands, including delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations. Recent findings suggest that slow harmonics in the delta and theta ranges within the brainstem underlie cardiorespiratory rhythms through phase-phase CFC (Kawai, 2023). In contrast, higher-frequency gamma oscillations (>30 Hz) convey information-rich signals via phase-amplitude CFC mechanisms. To date, triple CFC modes have not been characterized in any brain region. Notably, simultaneous delta-theta-gamma coupling-encompassing both phase-phase and phase-amplitude interactions-appears to operate cooperatively, suggesting functional integration through emergent synchrony within the brainstem. Multiple recordings from the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) demonstrate that the power and coherence of these synchronized oscillations exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns along the dorsoventral axis, reflecting differentiation among large-scale efferent systems and cytoarchitectural domains (Kawai, 2018a; Negishi and Kawai, 2011). Robust gamma activity, phase-coupled with delta and theta oscillations generated by resilient harmonic oscillators within the NTS and the broader brainstem network, may constitute a cooperative mechanism for large-scale homeostatic regulation. The dynamic balance of signal power between slow (delta/theta) and fast (gamma) components could nonlinearly modulate oscillator network dynamics and widespread projection systems throughout the brain. Such integrative neural dynamics likely support adaptive, whole-body responses to fluctuations in the interoceptive environment.",

We tested if functional connectivity between neurons varies within brain states in a way compatible with a fluctuating level of consciousness. We examined directed functional connectivity between neurons across the wake-sleep cycle in rats, at a scale of a few seconds. We analyzed patterns of functional connectivity to determine if Non-REM sleep contains epochs in which inter-areal integration is comparable to that observed in wakefulness and REM sleep, and vice versa. This study will potentially reveal if circuit-level connectivity patterns are observed during sleep stages, in line with the presence of an alternation between levels of consciousness not only between but also within brain states.",

    "title": "Shared neural geometries for bilingual semantic representations",
    "content": "The human brain has the remarkable ability to understand and express similar concepts in multiple languages. To understand how it does so, we examined responses of hippocampal neurons during passive listening, directed speaking, and spontaneous conversation, in both English and Spanish, in a small group of balanced bilinguals. We find putative translation neurons, whose responses to equivalent words (e.g., tierra and earth) are correlated. More broadly, however, neurons semantic tunings differed substantially by language, suggesting language-specific neural implementations. Despite this, distances between words neural responses are preserved between the two languages, creating a shared semantic geometry. That geometry was implemented by the same neurons but along distinct readout axes; this difference in readout may help prevent cross-language interference. Shared semantic geometry with distinct readout axes is also observed in mBERT, a multi-language LLM, suggesting this may be a general computational principle for multilingual representation. Together, these results suggest that hippocampus encodes a language-independent internal model for meaning.",

    "content": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a lipid mediator signaling through broadly expressed G protein-coupled receptors. We found that S1P is regulated by alcohol and that S1P receptor agonists reduce alcohol drinking in rodent models. Specifically, we observed that two S1P receptor agonists FDA-approved for multiple sclerosis, fingolimod and ozanimod, and the more brain penetrant S1P1 receptor agonist CYM5442, reduced binge alcohol drinking in the drinking in the dark (DID) paradigm in mice. CYM5442 also reduced drinking in dependent mice in the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor paradigm of dependence-induced increased drinking paired with 2 bottle-choice (CIE-2BC) as well as in non-dependent mice. CYM5442 reduced operant oral alcohol self-administration in both non-dependent and dependent rats made dependent by vapor exposure, and reduced motivation for alcohol in dependent rats tested in a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. CYM5442 significantly prevented cue-induced reinstatement in alcohol-dependent rats, a model of relapse to alcohol seeking. CYM5442 also reduced intake of non-drug reinforcers, including sucrose, food, water and, to a lesser extent, saccharine. Notably, CYM5442 was less aversive than naltrexone, an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorder that shares a similar broad reducing action on alcohol intake and consummatory behavior. CYM5442 had no effect on loss of righting reflex, alcohol metabolism, motor coordination or spontaneous locomotor activity in rodents. Lastly, gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq revealed that S1P regulates a complex set of genes in the transition to alcohol dependence. Overall, our results establish S1P signaling as a novel therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder.",

    "title": "Neural dynamics in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex underlie learning from feedback",
    "content": "Learning often depends on feedback, yet how positive and negative outcomes reorganize target representations to support later memory retrieval remains poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) acts as a central hub linking learning and retrieval, raising the possibility that it plays a critical role in this process. Here we analysed spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from vlPFC while monkeys performed a multi-cycle object-learning task. During the initial learning cycle, correct and incorrect feedback elicited distinct neural responses in both spiking and LFPs. In particular, positive feedback produced elevated theta power and enhanced theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (TG-PAC), associated with sustained suppression of neural spiking. Incorrect feedback induced stronger beta power. Despite comparable levels of object information under both feedback conditions, decoders trained and tested within the same feedback state outperformed those tested across states, revealing feedback-dependent coding formats. State-space analyses further showed that object representations following positive feedback were geometrically closer to those reinstated during later retrieval, indicating that feedback reshapes neural geometry toward retrieval-compatible states. Moreover, these geometric effects were selectively expressed on electrodes showing stronger TG-PAC or beta power, suggesting that oscillatory coordination may regulate how feedback signals are transformed into stable target codes. Together, our results reveal how vlPFC serve as a critical bridge between learning and memory retrieval, with feedback-driven dynamics reorganizing population geometry through rhythmic coordination and bringing successful outcome states closer to future retrieval representations.",

    "title": "A method for the time-frequency analysis of high-order interactions in non-stationary physiological networks",
    "content": "Objective. Several data-driven approaches based on information theory have been proposed for analyzing high-order interactions (HOIs) involving three or more components of a network system. The existing methods do not account for temporal correlations in the data, or are defined only in the time domain and rely on the assumption of stationarity in the underlying dynamics, making them inherently unable to detect frequency-specific behaviors and track transient functional links in physiological networks. Approach. This study introduces a new framework which enables the time-varying and time-frequency analysis of HOIs in networks of random processes through the spectral representation of vector autoregressive models. The time- and frequency-resolved analysis of synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of processes is ensured by a robust identification procedure based on a recursive least squares estimator with a forgetting factor. Main results. Validation on simulated networks illustrates how the time-frequency analysis is able to highlight transient synergistic behaviors emerging in specific frequency bands which cannot be detected by time-domain stationary analyzes. The application on brain evoked potentials in rats elicits the presence of redundant information timed with whisker stimulation and mostly occurring in the contralateral hemisphere. The application to cardiovascular oscillations reveals a reduction in redundant information following head-up tilt, reflecting a functional disconnection within the physiological network of heart period, respiratory, and arterial pressure signals. Significance. The proposed framework enables a comprehensive time-varying and time-frequency analysis of the hierarchical organization of dynamic networks. As our approach goes beyond pairwise interactions, it is well suited for the study of transient high-order behaviors arising during state transitions in many network systems commonly studied in physiology, neuroscience and other fields.",

    "title": "A Multimodal Atlas Reveals the Anatomical Distribution of Medium Spiny Neuron Subtypes and a Novel RGS6+ Population in the Primate Striatum",
    "content": "The primate striatum and its principal neuron type, the medium spiny neuron (MSN), integrate cortical and subcortical signals related to movement, cognition, and emotion. These signals are processed through cell type specific circuits traditionally defined by MSN dopamine receptor expression. However, classification by dopamine receptor type alone fails to fully specify MSN diversity and falls short of capturing the functional complexity of the striatum. Here, we combined single-nucleus multi-omic sequencing and high-plex spatial transcriptomics to build a comprehensive atlas of MSNs in the macaque striatum. Using multi-omic sequencing, we profiled MSNs across four anatomically and functionally defined territories, and we mapped these subtypes back into their anatomical context by integrating the multi-omic data with ~5.4 million spatially resolved cells sampled across the full rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral extent of the striatum. This approach revealed two previously undocumented ventral striatum (VS) subtypes, D1-VS-RGS6 and D2-VS-RGS6, which are molecularly distinct from known ventral striatal MSNs yet share core limbic features. We also uncovered gradients in matrix-compartment cell types along the rostral-caudal axis. Finally, by integrating MSN subtype-specific transcriptomes and ATAC-seq-derived regulatory annotations with human GWAS data, we demonstrate strong, cell-type-specific enrichment of polygenic risk for Parkinson's disease, substance use disorders, and psychiatric and cognitive traits, including a striking association of D2-VS-RGS6 with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Together, this multimodal atlas provides a foundation for linking primate striatal cell types to circuit function and disease mechanisms.",

    "title": "From Tasks to Topology: Dorsal and Ventral Streams Emerge in Optimized Neural Networks",
    "content": "The primate visual system is organized into dorsal and ventral pathways, classically linked to visuomotor control and perception. A long-standing question is whether this division reflects intrinsic architectural priors or emerges from task demands. We trained a single convolutional network to perform classification and grasp prediction of 3D objects, without imposing modular structure. Dual-stream topology - functionally distinct visuomotor and perceptual pathways - emerged spontaneously with rich cross-communication. Shapley value analyses revealed that action- and perception-selective features developed progressively across depth, reflecting task-driven hierarchical specialization. Time-resolved EEG showed that model activity mapped onto dissociable temporal components in human cortex: ventral-aligned signals emerged early and late, where dorsal- and ventral-aligned responses coincided in the intervening interval. These results demonstrate that task optimization alone can explain core features of dorsal-ventral organization, and that distinct temporal roles for perception and action arise naturally atop a shared feedforward scaffold, without requiring architectural hard-coding or recurrence.",

    "title": "Comparative Cilia Analysis in the Cerebral Cortices of Turtles, Mice, and Macaques",
    "content": "Primary cilia are centriole-derived sensory organelles found in most vertebrate cells including neurons. In the mouse neocortex, the primary cilia of pyramidal neurons are found to orient predominantly toward the pia, reflecting a reverse movement that occurs during postnatal neuronal repositioning. This study compared cilia orientation in principal excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex across turtles, mice, and macaques to identify patterns to infer mechanisms of cortical evolution. We first developed custom MATLAB Apps to facilitate the fast identification and statistical analyses of cilia orientation. We found that generally the primary cilia of principal neurons in sparse inside-out laminated regions, including the macaque and mouse neocortex, macaque CA1, mouse entorhinal cortex and neighboring regions, and mouse piriform cortex layer III, orient toward the pia. In contrast, primary cilia in compact laminae of these species, including the macaque and mouse dentate gyrus (DG), macaque CA3, mouse piriform cortex layer II, and turtle lateral cortex manifest opposite orientations, positioning perpendicular to the laminae. These data suggest that over the course of cortical evolution, primary cilia in principal neurons evolve from initially having no preferred orientation to becoming increasingly oriented toward the pial surface. We propose a working model for cortical evolution: the placement of principal neurons progresses from minimal migration in lower vertebrates to forward migration in higher species, and ultimately to pronounced reverse soma movement in higher inside-out laminated cortices, driven by the accumulation of large neuronal populations in the outer layers after completing radial migration.",

We observed overlapping hemodynamic traveling waves across domains, with auditory-motor regions activated earlier, followed by visual, posterior parietal, and Sylvian parietal-temporal (Spt) regions, supporting sensorimotor transformation and online monitoring of production. Increasing rhythmic complexity elicited slower and stronger activations in both domains: compared with baseline, regular rhythm control elicited delayed and amplified responses, while irregular rhythm control produced the slowest and strongest responses. During music production, rhythm-related activity expanded into frontal and temporal language regions, suggesting that higher rhythmic demands engage language resources. These findings reveal dynamic neural ensembles that can flexibly reconfigure shared resources to support temporal precision in sequence production.",

    "content": "Flexible adaptation requires inferring the causes of feedback and adjusting accordingly. When tasks are hierarchically structured with high-level rules governing low-level perceptual judgements, good performance requires hierarchical reasoning. Yet the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Here, building on Bayesian modelling and recurrent neural network simulation of hierarchical reasoning, we verified that such algorithm and representations are implemented in human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). dACC encodes accumulated errors and perceptual difficulty to estimate high-level rule switch confidence. These two variables were represented along two separable dimensions, and could be approximated by Gaussian basis functions. Orthogonality between these two dimensions yielded an optimal two-dimensional representation for hierarchical reasoning. A closer-to-orthogonal representational geometry also predicted better performance. Together, these findings provide an integrated computational and neural representational basis for hierarchical reasoning.",

    "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "content": "BackgroundChronic pain significantly impacts the physical, emotional, and social wellbeing of individuals. Despite advances in treatments, chronic pain prevalence continues to rise, emphasizing the need for comprehensive therapeutic approaches.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of a one-month Pain Oriented Biobehavioral Therapeutic Education (POBTE) program on clinical outcomes for chronic primary musculoskeletal pain.MethodsIn a single-blind feasibility pilot of a randomized controlled trial, 16 participants were assigned to an intervention group receiving POBTE education and exercise (n\u202f=\u202f8) or a control group (n\u202f=\u202f8) participating in exercise only. Primary outcomes were pain intensity, measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) plasma levels.ResultsThe intervention group showed a significant increase in BDNF levels from a mean of 2.174 at baseline to 3.063 at the end of treatment (p\u202f=\u202f0.001, r\u202f=\u202f0.63), with a non-significant reduction in pain intensity. Secondary outcomes, including anxiety, sleep quality, and physical activity, improved significantly. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size.ConclusionThe POBTE program appears feasible and acceptable, showing preliminary signals consistent with potential improvements in several clinical variables related to chronic pain management. These exploratory findings support the need for larger-scale, adequately powered trials.",

These effects are dependent on multiple factors, including altitude, exposure duration, pre-acclimatization conditions, psychological traits, and individual differences. Existing studies have investigated pathogenesis, epidemiology, and interventions for hypobaric hypoxia-associated cognitive impairment based on population studies and preclinical models. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involve energy metabolism, neuronal autophagy, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, gut microbiota imbalances, and genetic susceptibility. However, no consensus has been reached on the most important mechanisms and most recommended animal models, and no standard effective interventions are currently available. This review aims to provide new insights and research perspectives for cognitive impairment following high-altitude exposure. By systematically summarizing the pathophysiological mechanisms of hypobaric hypoxia-associated cognitive impairment, we comprehensively compare animal models for studying high-altitude-induced cognitive decline using three paradigms, i.e., mild, moderate, and extreme high-altitude exposure. Additionally, we introduce various in vitro models, including pluripotent stem cells and brain organoids, which can be used to evaluate the potential mechanisms and therapies. Furthermore, we analyze the challenges in current studies and propose key research directions for future work.",

    "title": "Risk of occult gastrointestinal bleeding with increased gut Enterococcus and Staphylococcus for poor outcomes in ischemic stroke patients",
    "content": "BackgroundGastrointestinal disorders are common in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients, but the impact of occult gastrointestinal bleeding (occult GIB) and its link to gut dysbiosis remain underexplored. Occult GIB, often undetected due to subtle symptoms, may significantly affect stroke recovery and long-term outcomes.MethodWe conducted a prospective, multi-center cohort study involving 482 AIS patients. Fecal samples collected within 48\u202fh of admission were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients were followed for 1\u202fyear to assess major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including death and recurrent stroke.ResultsOccult GIB was identified in 13.9% of patients, who had significantly higher rates of 90-day dependency (56.7% vs. 20.5%) and 1-year MACEs (28.6% vs. 15.5%) compared to non-GIB patients. These patients also exhibited higher infection rates and enrichment of specific gut pathogens, including Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated levels of these pathogens were independent risk factors for occult GIB. Furthermore, occult GIB independently predicted 90-day dependency (aOR 2.478, 95% CI [1.159\u20135.296]) and 1-year MACEs (aOR 1.905, 95% CI [1.003\u20133.617]).ConclusionOccult GIB is prevalent in AIS patients and is associated with worse long-term outcomes, particularly in those with enrichment of these specific gut pathogens. Early detection and management of occult GIB may improve patient outcomes. Future research should focus on elucidating underlying mechanisms and developing targeted interventions.",

    "title": "Exercise as a modulator of gut microbiota for improvement of sleep quality: a narrative review",
    "content": "Sleep quality is a cornerstone of physical and mental well-being, yet millions of individuals worldwide suffer from chronic sleep disturbances. Recent developments in microbiome research have shown that the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis regulates sleep by two-way communication between the gut and brain. Exercise is well-documented for its beneficial impact on sleep, yet emerging evidence indicates that one mechanism by which it achieves this may involve the modulation of gut microbiota. This narrative review examines the developing triadic relationship among exercise, gut microbiota, and sleep. It examines how exercise influences microbial diversity, the production of sleep-related metabolites like serotonin, GABA, and SCFAs, and immune responses that collectively shape sleep architecture. Additionally, the review highlights physiological factors influenced by exercise\u2014such as gut motility, intestinal barrier function, and bile acid metabolism\u2014that may impact the gut ecosystem and, in turn, sleep. Although encouraging results, deficiencies persist in our comprehension of the specific mechanisms connecting these domains. This review underscores the need for interdisciplinary research and suggests that targeting the gut microbiota via customized exercise interventions presents a promising, non-pharmacological strategy for enhancing sleep quality.",

    "title": "Feasibility of decoding cerebellar movement-related potentials for brain-computer interface applications",
    "content": "Objective. In brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, signals are conventionally acquired from the cerebrum, and only a subset of the complex interactions that occur in several areas of the brain are collected. One area that has not been investigated for BCI application is the cerebellum, despite its involvement in movement and executive function. The present study aimed to determine the features of movement-related cerebellar electrocerebellography (ECeG) that are most useful for decoding, and how performance compares with conventional electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the cerebrum. Approach. ECeG and EEG data were collected from six healthy adults to identify useful movement-related features from both cerebrum and cerebellum. Electromyography was used to capture the movements from the muscles. Decoding was conducted in binary movement vs. rest and movement vs. movement systems using support vector machines. Decoding performance was compared between cerebral, cerebellar, a combination of both, and temporal groups. Re-referencing techniques were applied to compensate for possible common reference artefacts or volume conduction effects. Main results. Movement-related features were decoded from over the cerebellum and the cerebrum. Classification accuracies were similar in both the cerebrum and cerebellum, when classifying movement vs. rest (cerebrum: 0.78 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.70 \u00b1 0.01) and movement vs. movement states (cerebrum: 0.76 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.71 \u00b1 0.02). The delta band (1\u20133 Hz) was the most useful feature for decoding. Significance. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that ECeG is a feasible source of movement related signals for implementing a BCI. The present study also demonstrated that the ECeG closely resembled the EEG signals and represents an alternate approach for BCI where the signal from the cerebrum is unreliable either due to disease or injury.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Nightmare Distress Questionnaire (NDQ) is commonly used to assess nightmare distress. The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "title": "Advanced Tool for Traffic Crash Analysis: An AI-Driven Multi-Agent Approach to Pre-Crash Reconstruction",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.10853v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.10693v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both \"polite and formal\" and \"casual and informal\" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.10652v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency",

We present Symbiotik, an intelligent, context-aware adaptive visualization system that leverages neurophysiological signals to estimate mental workload (MWL) and dynamically adapt visual dashboards using reinforcement learning (RL).

    "content": "arXiv:2511.11287v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The increasing deployment of autonomous AI agents on the web is hampered by a fundamental misalignment: agents must infer affordances from human-oriented user interfaces, leading to brittle, inefficient, and insecure interactions. To address this, we introduce VOIX, a web-native framework that enables websites to expose reliable, auditable, and privacy-preserving capabilities for AI agents through simple, declarative HTML elements. VOIX introduces  and  tags, allowing developers to explicitly define available actions and relevant state, thereby creating a clear, machine-readable contract for agent behavior. This approach shifts control to the website developer while preserving user privacy by disconnecting the conversational interactions from the website. We evaluated the framework's practicality, learnability, and expressiveness in a three-day hackathon study with 16 developers. The results demonstrate that participants, regardless of prior experience, were able to rapidly build diverse and functional agent-enabled web applications. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational mechanism for realizing the Agentic Web, enabling a future of seamless and secure human-AI collaboration on the web.",

A modular system couples live gesture, position, and speech inputs to scenographic outputs through a visual logic layer that performers can operate in rehearsal. Across six workshops with eight professional performance-makers, we staged a progression from parallel ensemble and technical training to integrated dramaturgy, culminating in a single-spectator scratch immersive performance with interactive elements. This paper details the system's building blocks and the workshop arc. A reflexive reading of workshop video logs, post-workshop focus groups, and facilitator notes surfaced three ensemble-level strategies that made the technology workable in a hybrid devising/design practice: rotating roles between operator, performer, and mediator; embracing controlled imperfection as a creative resource; and using technology-describing metaphors to support creative practice.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.11209v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: IoT Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) typically offer coarse-grained permission controls. Even when fine-grained controls are available, users are likely overwhelmed by the complexity of setting privacy preferences. This paper contributes to usable privacy management for TAPs by deriving privacy clusters and profiles for different types of users that can be semi-automatically assigned or suggested to them. We developed and validated a questionnaire, based on users' privacy concerns regarding confidentiality and control and their requirements towards transparency in TAPs. In an online study (N=301), where participants were informed about potential privacy risks, we clustered users by their privacy concerns and requirements into Basic, Medium and High Privacy clusters. These clusters were then characterized by the users' data sharing preferences, based on a factorial vignette approach, considering the data categories, the data recipient types, and the purpose of data sharing. Our findings show three distinct privacy profiles, providing a foundation for more usable privacy controls in TAPs.",

These traces offer insight into how models think and their goals, improving explainability and helping users follow the logic, learn the process, and even debug errors. These traces, however, are often verbose and complex, making them cognitively demanding to comprehend. We address this challenge with ReTrace, an interactive system that structures and visualizes textual reasoning traces to support understanding. We use a validated reasoning taxonomy to produce structured reasoning data and investigate two types of interactive visualizations thereof. In a controlled user study, both visualizations enabled users to comprehend the model's reasoning more accurately and with less perceived effort than a raw text baseline. The results of this study could have design implications for making long and complex machine-generated reasoning processes more usable and transparent, an important step in AI explainability.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.11112v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multiple-view (MV) visualization provides a comprehensive and integrated perspective on complex data, establishing itself as an effective method for visual communication and exploratory data analysis. While existing studies have predominantly focused on designing explicit visual linkages and coordinated interactions to facilitate the exploration of MV visualizations, these approaches often demand extra graphical and interactive effort, overlooking the potential of color as an effective channel for encoding data and relationships. Addressing this oversight, we introduce C2Views, a new framework for colormap design that implicitly shows the relation across views. We begin by structuring the components and their relationships within MVs into a knowledge-based graph specification, wherein colormaps, data, and views are denoted as entities, and the interactions among them are illustrated as relations. Building on this representation, we formulate the design criteria as an optimization problem and employ a genetic algorithm enhanced by Pareto optimality, generating colormaps that balance single-view effectiveness and multiple-view consistency. Our approach is further complemented with an interactive interface for user-intended refinement. We demonstrate the feasibility of C2Views through various colormap design examples for MVs, underscoring its adaptability to diverse data relationships and view layouts. Comparative user studies indicate that our method outperforms the existing approach in facilitating color distinction and enhancing multiple-view consistency, thereby simplifying data exploration processes.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.04454v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: My findings show what causes loss of awareness, anesthesia, memory replay, opioid induced respiratory depression (OIRD), and slow-wave sleep (SWS). Opiates are fast pain relievers and anesthetics that can cause respiratory arrest. I found how mu-opioids and anesthetics by activating medial habenula (MHb) and/or interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) induce unawareness and slowdown respiration. MHb projects to IPN and both increase their glucose intake during anesthesia (Herkenham, 1981). The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? I found that it promotes SWS, memory replay, sharp-wave ripples, spindles, hippocampo-cortical replay, synaptogenesis, rest and recovery, by activating median raphe (MRN) serotonin, and by inhibiting the theta state circuit, new memories encoding, awareness, arousal, alert wakefulness, and REM sleep. It causes also natural slowdown of respiration and heart rate, while it inhibits locomotion and arousal. This extended model adds role of the dentate gyrus>posterior septum>MHb>IPN>MRN>hippocampus + BF + claustrum>cortical slow-waves in memory replay, ripples, loss of awareness, SWS, and anesthesia. It proposes new neural mechanism for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN>MRN>claustrum>cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. My model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence, and wanting. This model claims that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, endocannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-protein production, spines growth, and anti-inflammatory state.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.10935v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) speech decoding has emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals with speech impairments. In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our findings suggest that tone-level decoding with minimal EEG-EMG channels is feasible and potentially generalizable across subjects, contributing to the development of practical BCI applications.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.10835v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.",

However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.",

A special case of this formulation predicts a previously unknown inequality governing sensory adaptation, which was confirmed across different modalities, species, and experimental conditions. Further analysis shows that the firing rate behaves like a state function in thermodynamics, leading to an entropy production equation from which a general law follows: any closed cycle of stimulation yields a non-negative net gain of sensory information.",

We propose a formal theory of network energetics explaining how brain states influence sequential behavior. We test our theory on multi-unit recordings from the caudate nucleus and cortical regions of macaques performing a motor habit task. The theory predicts the energy required to transition between brain states represented by trial-specific firing rates across channels, assuming activity spreads through effective connections. We hypothesized that habit formation would correlate with lower control energy. Consistent with this, we observed smaller energy requirements for transitions between similar saccade patterns and those of intermediate complexity, and sessions exploiting fewer patterns. Simulations ruled out confounds from neurons' directional tuning. Finally, virtual lesioning demonstrated robustness of observed relationships between control energy and behavior. This work paves the way for examining how behavior arises from changing activity in distributed circuitry.",

    "content": "Advances in single-cell genomics technologies enable the routine acquisition of atlases with millions of cells. These datasets often include multiple sources of variation, such as donors, sequencing platforms, developmental timepoints, and species. Although these covariates provide new opportunities for discovery, they also present challenges for downstream analyses. To mitigate unwanted sources of variation, dataset integration is the starting point for most analyses. However, existing methods struggle with integrating large and complex datasets. To address these limitations, we developed PIANO, a variational autoencoder framework that uses a negative binomial generalized linear model for stronger batch correction, and code compilation for up to ten times faster training than existing tools. We first demonstrate performant integration compared to commonly used integration methods on single-species datasets. We then show PIANO enables superior analyses of multiple atlases, solving challenging integration tasks across sequencing platforms, developmental timepoints, and species, while simultaneously preserving desired biological signals. Our contributions include a novel, high-performance integration method and recommendations for integration applications.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

    "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

    "title": "Cochlear histopathology in macaques after noise-induced temporary threshold shifts",
    "content": "Noise exposures causing transient hearing loss were previously considered benign. However, recent work has revealed that temporary noise-induced threshold shifts may be associated with long-lasting cochlear histopathology. One such effect is cochlear synaptopathy, i.e. changes to the afferent synapse between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. Noise-induced synaptopathy has been extensively characterized in several rodent models, and temporal bone studies suggest similar age-related changes in humans. However, it remains unclear how noise-induced temporary threshold shifts affect cochlear structures in humans and nonhuman primates, which show greater resistance to noise exposure than other animals. Additionally, the long-term sequelae of temporary threshold shifts are largely unknown. Here, we characterized the effects of a noise exposure causing temporary hearing loss on cochlear histopathology in macaque monkeys at long post-exposure survival times. Overall, cochlear histopathology was variable across subjects, similar to the variable susceptibility observed in humans. At 2 and 10 months post-exposure, macaques had no significant loss of hair cells, inner hair cell synapses, or cholinergic efferent innervation. However, enlargement of ribbons in both inner and outer hair cells was observed. Together, these findings provide insight into the cochlear effects of single-exposure temporary threshold shifts in nonhuman primates.",

    "title": "Deciphering the role of brainstem vestibular-related inhibitory networks in shaping postural reflexes in the Xenopus tadpole",
    "content": "Brainstem vestibulospinal (VS) nuclei generate excitatory commands in response to multi-modality sensory integration, to activate specific spinal networks in order to generate adapted postural reflexes. Comparably organized in bilateral nuclei with both ipsi- and contralateral pathways in all species, excitatory VS projections alone fail to explain the mostly unilateral reflex responses typically observed. In the Xenopus laevis tadpole, we describe secondary vestibular neurons of inhibitory nature, and the synaptic contacts they make on VS neurons. Then, using a brainstem/spinal cord in vitro preparation we show that the spinal responses evoked by galvanic vestibular stimulation are shaped by both commissural and local inhibitory brainstem networks. We further show that a complex interaction between GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory networks regulate VS neuron excitability and, consequently, the expression of the spinal response. Our data reveal that while excitatory VS neurons execute the neural score, inhibitory neurons in the central vestibular system coordinate and modulate the overall performance.",

    "title": "No Evidence for Stronger Brain-Behavior Associations in the Bimanual Motor Network of Older Adults",
    "content": "Bimanual motor performance declines with age, is accompanied by cortical thinning and alterations in white matter microstructure within motor control networks. Aging is also associated with increased interindividual variability in behavioural and structural markers, and some studies report stronger brain-behaviour associations in older compared to younger adults. However, evidence for this remains mixed, and it is unclear whether young adults express similar relationships under comparable task demands. We tested whether bimanual performance is related differently to structural brain properties in younger and older adults. Twenty-three younger (22-27 years) and twenty-three older adults (65-70 years) performed a visually guided bimanual pinch-force task and underwent whole-brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and cortical thickness (CTh) were extracted from a pre-defined bilateral visuo-motor network and compared between groups. In regions showing significant age-related differences, we tested whether and how FA and CTh values correlates with bimanual performance within each age group. Older adults showed lower FA in the anterior portions of the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) III and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and lower CTh across most visuomotor regions, along with lower bimanual performance compared to young adults. Structure-function analyses in these areas revealed that bimanual performance correlated positively with FA in the anterior segment of the right SLF III in younger but not older adults. Furthermore, larger hemispheric asymmetries in cortical thickness between the dominant and non-dominant SMA correlated positively with larger intermanual performance differences between the dominant and non-dominant hand in younger but not older adults. These findings suggest that intrahemispheric white-matter integrity and interhemispheric cortical balance support efficient bimanual control in early adulthood, but they provide no evidence that structure-function relationships increase with age.",

    "title": "Spontaneous otocoherence of the active ear",
    "content": "Spontaneous otoacoustic emission (SOAE) provides compelling evidence of active force generation inside the inner ear, although there is significant debate about the underlying generation mechanism(s). SOAE is commonly characterized by peaks in a spectral domain representation (as derived from a discrete Fourier transform), occurring at idiosyncratic frequencies unique to a given ear. Such is typically computed as an averaged magnitude spectrum that discards phase information. Here, we explore the hypothesis that SOAE phase, readily extracted from pre-existing recordings, contains complementary information. We propose several measures to use this information to quantify otocoherence (a form of autocoherence referring to a phenomenon of the ear), primarily by measuring the consistency in SOAE phase accumulation over a particular timescale. We present results based on recordings from different species with disparate inner ear morphologies (humans, barn owls, lizards). For regions of SOAE activity we extract time constants representing the timescale over which otocoherence is maintained. We demonstrate that these vary significantly across species and (for the barn owl and Tokay gecko where this data is available) appear to correlate with measures of auditory nerve fiber tuning. Additionally, we adapted the method to identify regions of weak SOAE activity among fluctuations in the noise floor. These methods can readily be employed to re-analyze SOAE waveforms previously collected from a variety of species, making them of broader comparative utility to reveal information about SOAE generation and thereby active cochlear mechanics.",

    "title": "Locus Coeruleus alpha-Synuclein Overexpression Induces Prodromal Parkinsonian Features in Mice",
    "content": "The locus coeruleus is one of the first brain regions to develop alpha-synuclein pathology during the prodromal phase of Parkinson Disease, contributing significantly to non-motor symptoms such as cognitive decline, mood alterations or sleep disturbances. However, the precise role of the locus coeruleus in the early stages of the disease remains unclear. To address this, we developed and characterized a novel mouse model based on the PRSx8-driven overexpression of human alpha-synuclein in noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus using an adeno-associated viral vector. Animals were assessed at 1 and 3 months post-injection using an integrated battery of histological, behavioural, neurochemical, and electrophysiological analyses. We observed robust accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the locus coeruleus, along with widespread propagation to projection areas, including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and dorsal raphe. Despite the absence of neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus, we identified reduced noradrenergic axonal integrity and marked decreases in both noradrenaline and serotonin levels, highlighting a disruption of neurochemical balance at an early stage. The electrophysiological data revealed transient alterations in the excitability and intrinsic properties of locus coeruleus neurons in a sex-dependent manner, suggesting that alpha-synuclein pathology induces early functional disruption prior to overt neurodegeneration. Behavioural outcomes demonstrated selective cognitive deficits and mild anxiety-like behaviours, while other non-motor functions remained preserved. Importantly, although several pathological and functional alterations were evident in the initial phases, behavioural impairments were also maintained at later time points, indicating that locus coeruleus-driven pathology exerts long-lasting consequences. Interestingly, female mice exhibited colon shortening, providing evidence of a sex-specific pathological process at the level of the gut-brain axis. We believe that this model accurately replicates key prodromal features of Parkinson disease, demonstrating that alpha-synuclein-induced pathology in the locus coeruleus leads to functional circuit impairment and cognitive decline. Our findings emphasize the locus coeruleus as a critical site of early vulnerability in Parkinson Disease and underscore the importance of sex as a biological variable influencing disease progression and therapeutic response.",

    "title": "Cortical response to balance perturbation is more sensitive in modern dancers than nondancers during biomechanically similar balance recovery",
    "content": "Motor skill expertise can facilitate more automatic movement, engaging less cortical activity while producing appropriate motor output. Accordingly, cortical-evoked N1 responses to balance perturbation, assessed using electroencephalography (EEG), are smaller in young and older adults with better balance. These responses may thus reflect individual balance challenge versus functional, or objective, task difficulty. However, the effect of balance expertise on cortical responses to balance perturbation has not been studied. We hypothesized that balance ability gained though long-term training facilitates more automatic balance control. Using professional modern dancers as balance experts, we compared cortical-evoked responses and biomechanics of the balance-correcting response between modern dancers and nondancers. We predicted that modern dancers would have smaller cortical-evoked responses and better balance recovery at equivalent levels of balance challenge. Support-surface perturbations were normalized to individual challenge levels by delivering perturbations scaled to 60% and 140% of each individual's step threshold. In contrast to our prediction, dancers exhibited larger N1 responses compared to nondancers while demonstrating similar biomechanical responses. Our results suggest dancers have greater cortical sensitivity to balance perturbations than nondancers. Further, dancer N1 responses modulated across perturbation magnitudes according to differences in objective task difficulty. In contrast, nondancer N1 responses modulated as a function of individual challenge level. Our findings suggest dance training increases sensitivity of the initial, cortical N1 response to balance perturbation, supporting postural alignment to an objective reference. The N1 response may reflect differences in balance-error processing that are altered with specific long-term training and may have implications for rehabilitation.",

    "content": "Nearly 1.4 million people in the United States sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year, with almost half of those hospitalized for TBI developing long-term disability. For many patients, prolonged bleeding and inflammation from damaged vessels in the meninges result in long-lasting sequelae. Although their injured blood vessels regrow, the site of injury is full of inflammatory immune cells that may influence vascular function. Adult zebrafish have a thin, translucent skull and a mammalian-like meninges that is easily imaged in living animals. We have established a novel adult zebrafish model to investigate vessel-immune cell interactions after meningeal cerebrovascular injury (mCVI). We use carefully calibrated sonication to rupture meningeal blood vessels without breaching the skull or causing damage to the underlying brain. By performing longitudinal live imaging of intubated adult fish we observe vascular regrowth and immune responses to mCVI over time in the same animal with unprecedented resolution allowing measurement of blood flow, dynamics of vessel regrowth, and interactions between individual immune and vascular cells. This newly developed zebrafish model provides a powerful tool for longitudinal live imaging of meningeal immune cell-vascular interactions after cerebrovascular injury, opening the door to new insights into chronic neuroinflammatory disease.",

    "title": "Inhibition governs stimulus preference encoding in mPFC pyramidal neurons during a social choice",
    "content": "Social decision-making requires the brain to continuously evaluate competing options and select appropriate actions. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in social cognition and value-based decision-making, yet the neural mechanisms by which it encodes the relative value of competing social choices remain poorly understood. Here, we employed fiber photometry, optogenetics, and projection-specific recordings in mice performing four distinct binary social discrimination tasks to reveal how mPFC pyramidal neurons encode social choice. We found that mPFC pyramidal neurons exhibit profound inhibition during bouts toward the preferred stimulus. This inhibitory response was specific to transitional bouts, when animals switched between stimuli, and was absent during non-transitional bouts, which occurred during continued engagement with the same stimulus. Notably, this differential activity encoded relative rather than absolute stimulus value, such that the same stimulus evoked opposite neural responses depending on its contextual preference. Accordingly, manipulating the subject's preference between food and social stimuli via food deprivation inverted its inhibition-excitation pattern. Furthermore, negative calcium transients in the mPFC predicted subsequent investigation of the preferred stimulus, suggesting a functional role in guiding behavioral choice. Optogenetic activation of mPFC pyramidal neurons during stimulus investigation produced immediate aversion yet paradoxically biased the stimulated animal to persistently re-engage with the stimulus-associated option through repetitive non-transitional bouts. Finally, projection-specific recordings revealed that mPFC neurons targeting the nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala were differentially recruited across tasks, reflecting functional specialization of output pathways. Together, these findings identify inhibition of mPFC pyramidal neurons as a key neural signature for encoding relative stimulus preference, thereby establishing a neural principle by which the mPFC dynamically guides social choice.",

    "title": "Transcranial Static Magnetic Stimulation Dissociates the Causal Roles of the Parietal Cortex in Spatial and Temporal Processing",
    "content": "Accurate time estimation is essential for optimizing our perception and actions. Previous neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have suggested that the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and supplementary motor area (SMA) are involved in time perception. However, it remains inconclusive whether the activity in these regions is crucial for time perception, partly due to the possible spread of TMS effects across anatomically connected brain regions. Such a remote effect is less likely to happen with transcranial static magnet stimulation (tSMS), as the static magnetic field is expected to modulate the firing threshold of neurons rather than directly triggering an action potential. In this study, we aimed to determine the causal relevance of local activities in the right IPL and the SMA for temporal processing using tSMS. We measured duration discrimination thresholds, along with orientation discrimination thresholds as a control, using staircase methods before and during the administration of tSMS over the IPL/SMA. Our results indicated no significant changes in duration discrimination thresholds in either the IPL or SMA conditions. In contrast, we observed an improvement in orientation discrimination thresholds in the IPL condition. This improvement correlated with individual differences in the distance between the scalp and the IPL. Overall, our findings demonstrate a causal involvement of the IPL in orientation processing. The correlation between the effects of tSMS and the scalp-to-target distance suggests that the efficacy of tSMS may be sensitive to the strength of the magnetic field.",

    "content": "The initial therapeutic exposure to DBS during implantation surgery has reproducible acute behavioral effects that carry over without further stimulation. We analyzed LFP data from the first month following brief therapeutic intraoperative DBS. Data were recorded from the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC). During this month no further stimulation was applied. Recent studies have identified beta power fluctuations in LFP data as an acute putative depression biomarker of this exposure. However, a detailed description of neural dynamics underlying brain power fluctuations is missing. Here, we provide a proof of principle study that these dynamics can be described using two new dynamical systems measures: instability frequency and relative wandering time. These capture interactions between neural activity and the mesoscale oscillatory electric fields generated by it. The two measures seem to split low vs. high HDRS scores within a small patient cohort. They are motivated by the cytoelectric coupling hypothesis, that suggests that efficient information processing results from mesoscale electric fields; and that the re-emergence of depression symptoms might result from altered electric fields. Whether the new measures reflect general mechanisms of rapid antidepressant action remains to be tested.",

    "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
    "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "title": "Precision neurodiversity: personalized brain network architecture as a window into cognitive variability",
    "content": "Precision neurodiversity marks a shift in neuroscience from pathological models to personalized frameworks that view neurological differences as adaptive variations. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the Personalized Brain Network architecture and its relationship with cognitive variability in both typical and neurodiverse populations. The study examines advancements in connectome-based prediction modeling, normative modeling, dynamic fingerprinting, and machine learning methods that characterize individual-specific neural networks. Recent findings indicate that the Personalized Brain Network profile reliably predicts cognitive, behavioral, and sensory phenomena. Additionally, deep generative models demonstrate high fidelity in synthesizing connective cells. Recent studies have identified distinct neurobiological subgroups in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder that were previously undetectable by conventional diagnostic criteria. However, research has revealed significant network-level differences among these subgroups. Researchers have identified age-resistant biomarkers in specific brain regions, and genetic mutations significantly influence the connectivity patterns of individuals. Clinical applications span a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and talent. Network variability predicts executive functioning, social perception, and sensory processing abilities. However, successful translation requires overcoming challenges related to statistical power, reproducibility, ethical implementation and community participation. The convergence of advanced neuroimaging, artificial intelligence, and personalized medicine offers unprecedented opportunities for tailored interventions, while celebrating neurological diversity as a source of human strength.",

    "title": "Multimodal neuroimaging of Col4a1-mutant mouse models of Gould syndrome",
    "content": "IntroductionCerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a leading cause of stroke and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Studying monogenic forms of cSVD can elucidate molecular pathways that are dysfunctional in the common sporadic forms and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Mutations in COL4A1 and COL4A2 cause highly penetrant cSVD as part of the multisystem disorder known as Gould syndrome, which includes cerebrovascular manifestations such as porencephaly, early-onset stroke, leukoencephalopathy, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).MethodsTo investigate how allelic heterogeneity influences cerebrovascular phenotypes, we examined five Col4a1 mutant mouse strains that collectively model the clinical spectrum of Gould syndrome. Each strain underwent multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 14.1 Tesla to assess radiological features characteristic of cSVD.ResultsMultimodal MRI successfully identified typical cSVD-associated lesions across all Col4a1 mutant strains. The imaging revealed heterogeneous expressivity among the allelic variants in terms of lesion prevalence, size, and number. Furthermore, analysis across strains identified brain regions that were consistently more vulnerable to cSVD-related lesions.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that high-field multimodal MRI can sensitively detect and differentiate cerebrovascular abnormalities among Col4a1 mutant mouse models of Gould syndrome. The approach provides a powerful, noninvasive platform for assessing genotype\u2013phenotype relationships and for identifying brain regions at heightened risk in cSVD, supporting its potential use in early diagnosis and mechanistic studies of vascular pathology.",

    "content": "ObjectiveBiallelic variants in KCTD7 have been associated with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset epilepsy, cognitive decline, myoclonus, and ataxia.MethodsWhole-exome sequencing was first performed in the elder sister to identify candidate variants, followed by in silico pathogenicity prediction. Sanger sequencing was then used to validate the variants in both parents and the younger brother.ResultsWe report two siblings with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) carrying compound heterozygous KCTD7 variants: c.334C\u202f>\u202fT (p.Arg112Cys), a paternally inherited variant previously reported in homozygous form and currently classified as likely pathogenic, and c.640C\u202f>\u202fT (p.Arg214Trp), a novel maternally inherited variant currently classified as of uncertain significance. Both patients presented between 2 and 3\u202fyears of age with gait instability, myoclonic seizures, and developmental regression. EEG revealed background slowing, multifocal spike\u2013slow wave discharges, and electrical status epilepticus during sleep. Brain MRI findings were initially unremarkable despite progressive neurological deterioration. Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger validation confirmed the variants and their segregation. In silico tools predicted both variants to be deleterious, and structural modeling using PyMOL and I-Mutant 3.0 demonstrated that both variants likely disrupt local residue interactions and reduce protein stability. Both patients received antiepileptic therapy and immunomodulatory treatment, including intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. The proband achieved seizure control and improved gait following immunotherapy, though cognitive deficits persisted. The younger sibling exhibited a more severe disease course, with progressive cognitive decline, speech and visual impairment, and loss of independent ambulation, despite partial seizure control. These findings expand the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of KCTD7-related PME and suggest that immunotherapy may confer partial clinical benefit in selected cases.ConclusionThis case expands the variant spectrum of KCTD7-related disorders and emphasizes the utility of comprehensive genetic testing in early-onset neurodegenerative epileptic syndromes. Functional studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of the novel KCTD7 variant.",

    "title": "The Turbulent Brain: a toolbox to compute the turbulent dynamical behaviour of whole-brain activity",
    "content": "Brain disorders remain one of the greatest challenges in neuroscience. Computational precision medicine offers a promising framework to reveal the mechanistic principles governing both healthy and pathological brain dynamics. In this context, we present The Turbulent Brain (TTB) toolbox, an open-source MATLAB platform that implements and disseminates the turbulence framework for immediate and widespread application in neuroscience research. The toolbox combines model-free and model-based analyses through an intuitive graphical interface, enabling customizable workflows across different parcellations and preprocessing pipelines. Our toolbox builds on recent advances demonstrating that turbulence physics can effectively capture the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity as a high-dimensional system operating far from equilibrium. This framework allows researchers to explore how fundamental mechanisms are modulated across distinct brain states and neurological and psychiatric disorders, including disorders of consciousness and major depressive disorder. As an illustrative application case, we used TTB to analyse fMRI data from 176 individuals from the Human Connectome Project during resting state and movie watching, showing that movie watching, as compared to resting state, significantly reduces information transmission in terms of turbulence measures, with stronger reductions observed during Creative Commons movie watching compared to Hollywood movies. In summary, the TTB toolbox establishes an accessible framework providing a methodological bridge between nonlinear physics and computational neuroscience, offering new tools for investigating psychiatric conditions and altered states of consciousness.",

    "title": "Population Morphology Implies a Common Developmental Blueprint for Drosophila Motion Detectors",
    "content": "Quantitative analysis of neuron morphology is essential in order to develop our understanding of circuit organisation and development. The recent acquisition of whole-brain electron microscopy-based (EM) reconstructions of the Drosophila melanogaster nervous system now provide the resolution needed to examine morphology at scale. Utilising these data, together with new computational tools, we extract and analyse the dendrites of all T4 and T5 neurons within one hemisphere (n [~] 6000). T4 and T5 neurons are the first uniquely direction-selective neurons in the visual pathway, and are classified into four subtypes (a,b,c, and d). Each subtype encodes one of four cardinal motion directions (up, down, forwards, backwards). The dendrites of these neurons form in two distinct neuropils, the Medulla (T4) and the Lobula (T5), and are asymmetrically oriented in a direction inverse to the direction of motion which they encode. However, their densely overlapping and compact arbours has made rigorous morphological quantification challenging. The presence of differences beyond their characteristic orientation, both between T4 and T5, as well as within subtypes, has remained poorly understood. Our analysis reveals a high degree of structural similarity across both types and subtypes. Particularly, measures of geometry and graph topology show only minor variation, with no consistent separation between T4 and T5, or their subtypes. These results indicate that, despite forming in different neuropils, and serving distinct motion directions, T4 and T5 dendrites follow closely aligned morphological patterns. This suggests that their arborization may be governed by shared developmental constraints and mechanisms.",

    "title": "Microstructural functional coupling as a multimodal biomarker of emotional state transitions in bipolar disorder",
    "content": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by dynamic transitions between depressive and manic states, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these state shifts remain unclear. Here, we developed an integrative framework to quantify the microstructural functional coupling (MFC) of the brain, which captures the distributional similarity between voxel wise diffusion and functional features within each cortical region. Using multimodal MRI data from 72 BD patients and 65 matched healthy controls, we observed a global increase of MFC of BD, which indicates a desimilarity of brain microstructure and function. Partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis revealed that the principal latent component linking MFC to behavioral scores explained 67.2% of the variance, with the strongest contributions from the control and somatosensory networks. Mediation analysis demonstrated that regional MFC influenced anxiety indirectly through depressive symptoms, supporting a sequential affective transition from depression to anxiety. Moreover, macroscale gradient analysis showed that the principal MFC gradient was significantly correlated with neurotransmitter receptor distributions, including A4B2, 5 HT1B, and H3. Together, these findings highlight MFC as a multimodal biomarker sensitive to emotional state transitions in BD and suggest its potential as a bridge between microstructural alterations, functional dynamics, and neurotransmitter systems.",

    "title": "Delta Opioid Receptors on Parvalbumin Neurons are Necessary for the Convulsant and Anxiolytic Effects of the Delta Agonist SNC80",
    "content": "The delta opioid receptor (DOR) is expressed broadly throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Activation of DOR by exogenous and endogenous ligands regulates pain, motivation, emotion and memory, but the cells and neural circuits mediating these behavioral effects remain poorly characterized. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons express high levels of DOR transcript (OPRD1) and protein (Birdsong et al 2019). Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons also play a role in pain and emotional processing, suggesting that DOR signaling on PV interneurons may modulate these behaviors. To address this question we used a conditional knockout mouse line (Floxed DOR; PV-cre) to delete DOR from PV-expressing cells. First, we validated the functional loss of DOR through whole-cell electrophysiology experiments. Next, we characterized baseline behavioral phenotypes and the convulsant, pro-locomotive and anxiolytic-like behavioral responses induced by the DOR agonist SNC80 in Floxed DOR; PV-Cre mice and their littermate controls. Interestingly, we found that the convulsant and anxiolytic effects of the DOR agonist SNC80 were diminished in Floxed DOR;PV Cre animals. However, baseline behavioral phenotypes, SNC80-induced spontaneous hyperlocomotion and respiratory stimulation were conserved. These novel findings indicate that the pro-convulsant and anxiolytic effects of DOR agonists are anatomically separable from the locomotor stimulating effects and are dependent on DOR expression on PV interneurons.",

    "title": "Gene network inference and master regulator analysis identifies the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR\u03b3) as a therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder (AUD).",
    "content": "Differential gene expression is often inadequate to predict the activity of transcription factors and their contribution to the phenotypes associated with specific gene expression states. Here we used a systems biology approach based on gene network inference and master regulator analysis (MRA) to identify candidate drivers of the gene network dysregulations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of human subjects with a history of alcohol dependence. The estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR{gamma}) gene ESRRG, an orphan nuclear receptor protein that acts as a transcription activator, emerged as a high-ranking Master Regulator (MR) based on the expression of its targets and was selected for functional validation due to its translational and druggability potential. The ERR{gamma} agonist, GSK4716, reduced alcohol drinking in the mouse binge drinking paradigm of drinking in the dark (DID) and in both non-dependent mice as well as in mice made dependent by chronic intermittent vapor exposure (CIE). GSK4716 also prevented alcohol-conditioned place preference without affecting saccharin intake or mouse locomotion. Similarly, in rats, GSK4716 reduced operant oral alcohol self-administration in non-dependent and dependent (by CIE) rats under fixed and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement. Overall, these results support the efficacy of transcriptome-wide gene regulatory network approaches for the identification of key druggable regulators of long-term transcriptional adaptations that sustain the molecular and behavioral pathology of alcohol dependence and identify ERR{gamma} as a regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and seeking, and a therapeutic target for AUD.",

    "title": "Deep Learning for Cognitive Task Presence Prediction from Dynamic Functional Connectivity",
    "content": "Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) studies the time-varying coordination between brain regions measured with fMRI and is a potential biomarker for understanding cognitive dynamics and tracking the development of neurological disorders. However, a critical methodological challenge lies in the variability of dFC estimates across different dFC assessment methods, raising concerns about the reliability and interpretation of downstream findings. While deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated the ability to capture traditionally inaccessible data patterns in many disciplines, they encounter challenges when applied to neuroimaging data. For instance, the high dimensionality, noise, and temporal complexity inherent in dFC makes it challenging for DL models to extract meaningful and interpretable insights. In this study, we investigated how DL architectures can be developed and adapted to predict task presence over time from task-based dFC data, and additionally, how the choice of dFC assessment method influences the predictive performance of DL models. We developed and compared a convolutional neural network (CNN), a node-level classification graph convolutional network (GCN), and a graph-level classification GCN based on their ability to predict time points at which subjects were performing a cognitive task or at rest. In our study, the results indicate that both DL model architecture and dFC estimation methodology significantly impact task presence prediction capacity, while the specific task paradigm had minimal influence out of the limited types that were explored. This work offers a powerful benchmark for understanding the dynamics of underlying task-driven cognitive state transitions and the analytical flexibility limitations of dFC estimation methods and DL architectures.",

    "content": "Humans can estimate the number of objects in a scene within a fraction of a second, suggesting that numerosity is encoded rapidly and directly by the visual system. Yet how this encoding unfolds over time and interacts with other visual features remains unclear. Here, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) with time-resolved representational similarity analysis (RSA) and MEG-fMRI fusion to track how numerosity is represented in the brain over time. We also used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to visualize the evolving patterns of neural activity. Two main findings emerged. First, numerosity exhibited the hallmarks of a primary perceptual attribute: its neural signature appeared rapidly after stimulus onset, preceding the encoding of non-numeric features that could otherwise define number. Second, Visualization of the neural patterns using MDS suggested a temporal transformation in representational geometry, reflecting the engagement of two distinct coding schemes- an early, linear number line, consistent with a \"summation code\", dominating activity in occipital regions, and a later, curved number line, consistent with \"numerosity-tuned code\", emerging more strongly in associative areas along the dorsal stream. Together, these findings demonstrate that numerosity processing is encoded directly from the visual image and unfolds through a rapid hierarchical transformation, from a broad quantity signal to a finely tuned, number-specific code, linking perceptual encoding to higher-level numerical abstraction.",

    "title": "UCM-A86 is a selective positive allosteric modulator of GluN1/GluN3 NMDA receptors",
    "content": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS) where they play critical roles in normal and pathological brain functions and neurodevelopment. While the glutamate/glycine-activated GluN2-containing NMDA receptors (GluN1/GluN2) have been extensively studied, the physiological roles and pharmacology of glycine-activated GluN3-containing receptors (GluN1/GluN3) remain less understood. Although GluN1/GluN3 receptors exhibit unique functional properties and play distinct roles in neuronal development and synapse maturation, studies of their precise roles in neurophysiology and circuit function are impeded by limited availability of GluN3-selective pharmacological tools. This study describes UCM-A86, a novel GluN3-selective positive allosteric modulator, with EC50 values of 21 M and 19 M at GluN1/GluN3A and GluN1/GluN3B receptors, respectively. UCM-A86 selectively potentiates recombinant GluN1/GluN3A and GluN1/GluN3B receptors by 436% and 174%, respectively, relative to activation by glycine, with no activity at recombinant GluN1/GluN2A-D receptors. Furthermore, UCM-A86 selectively potentiates responses from native GluN1/GluN3A receptors expressed in somatostatin-expressing interneurons of the somatosensory cortex with no modulation of hippocampal AMPA receptor- and GluN1/2 NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Mechanistic studies suggest that UCM-A86 modulation is facilitated by agonist binding (or channel gating) and that UCM-A86 primarily potentiates GluN1/GluN3A by increasing open probability with no effects on mean channel conductance. These findings advance the synthetic pharmacology of GluN1/GluN3 receptors and provide a novel tool for modulation of native GluN3-containing NMDA receptors.",

    "title": "Short trains of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation increase online corticospinal excitability and pupil size in humans",
    "content": "Background: Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has emerged as a method for interrogating the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine system in human behavior. Tuning of excitability in the corticospinal tract is central to many cognitive and motor processes, but little is known about how the LC contributes to this tuning. In particular, no existing studies have examined the effect of tVNS on corticospinal excitability 'online' during active stimulation, where the largest effects on pupil size are observed. Method: To address this question, we delivered repeated 4-second trains of tVNS and sham stimulation and elicited MEPs during stimulation trains (online) and shortly after train offset (offline). Pupil size was concurrently recorded throughout each train. Results: We discovered that tVNS significantly increases corticospinal excitability compared to sham stimulation, but only when measured online and not offline. The excitatory effects on corticospinal excitability were greater in the latter half of tVNS trains. Pupil size was also significantly increased by tVNS compared to sham; however, the effect on pupil size peaked earlier during the tVNS trains compared to corticospinal excitability. In line with these distinct temporal profiles, changes in corticospinal excitability and pupil size were not significantly correlated, likely reflecting differences in the anatomical circuits underpinning each effect. Conclusions: This work demonstrates for the first time that tVNS increases corticospinal excitability at rest, but the effect only emerges when corticospinal excitability is measured online during active tVNS. Implications for basic and clinical neuroscientific research are discussed.",

    "content": "In addition to driving dependency and overdose, illicit use of opioids, such as fentanyl, is linked to the risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Growing evidence also indicates that opioid use is associated with pathological features, paralleled early in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which raises the possibility of the involvement of mechanistic interactions between opioid use and AD progression. Here, we investigate how chronic fentanyl use (i.e., 20 days) influences the neuroimmune state, microglial activity, and amyloid burden in wildtype and APPPS1-21 mice, a transgenic model of AD. In wild-type mice, fentanyl use promoted a pro-inflammatory state without increasing the incidence of disease-associated microglia. In APPPS1-21 mice, chronic fentanyl use led to a shift favoring an anti-inflammatory state, which was associated with increased microglia clustering and activation at A{beta} plaques, increased A{beta} internalization in plaque-associated activated microglia, decreased soluble A{beta}, and decreased plaque burden. Our findings indicate that chronic fentanyl use fundamentally changes the trajectory of neuroimmune activity and features characteristic of early AD by enabling microglia to enhance A{beta} clearance. The interactions demonstrate how substance use can reshape the neuroimmune landscape in neurodegenerative disease, emphasizing the importance of tailored treatment strategies.",

    "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
    "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

    "title": "Changes in muscle activation and joint motion during walking after transtibial amputation with sensory feedback from spinal cord stimulation: a case study",
    "content": "Objective. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on muscle activity during walking after lower-limb amputation. Amputation results in a loss of sensory feedback and alterations in gait biomechanics, including co-contractions of antagonist muscles about the knee and ankle, and reduced pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop. SCS can restore sensation in the missing limb, but its effects on muscle activation and gait biomechanics have not been studied in people with lower-limb amputation. Approach. This case study included a participant with transtibial amputation who was implanted percutaneously with SCS electrodes over the lumbosacral enlargement for 84 d. SCS was used during in-lab experiments to provide somatosensory feedback from the missing limb, relaying a sense of plantar pressure when the prosthesis was in the stance phase of the gait cycle. We used electromyography (EMG) to record muscle activity from the residual and intact limbs, and 3D motion capture to measure pelvic obliquity and knee and ankle joint angles. EMG signals were recorded during walking with and without SCS at early (Day 30) and late (Day 63) time points across the implant duration. Main results. During walking, co-contraction of knee antagonist muscles was reduced following multiple sessions of SCS-mediated sensory restoration. Additionally, the activation of the hip abductor (tensor fasciae latae) muscle increased activity during gait with SCS-mediated sensory restoration, which corresponded to an increase in pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop, towards normal. Significance. Restoring sensation in the missing limb using SCS altered muscle activity during walking led to improved coordination and pelvic motion in an individual with lower-limb amputation.",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Nightmare disorder in women.",
    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

    "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

This study presents a new non-magnetic, cost-effective solution using a digital fiber optic sensor to continuously measure the distance between an OPM and the subject\u2019s skin. Following sensor calibration, distance measurements were recorded during an isometric muscle fatigue task in five healthy participants to assess whether MMG amplitude changes were due to physiological effects or variations in sensor-to-source distance. Alongside OPM-MMG and distance tracking, electromyography (EMG), the neurophysiological gold standard, was simultaneously recorded. Main results. We found significant changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue that were not merely explained by changes in sensor-to-source distance. Furthermore, we found substantial correlations between OPM-MMG and EMG that were strongest for small sensor-to-source distance (r = 0.91). Significance. Fiber optic sensors offer non-magnetic, precise, real-time monitoring of the distance between the OPM and the skin, making it ideal for MMG applications to account for distance-related variability during measurements. Our results suggest that changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue reflect genuine physiological effects rather than distance confounds.",

You can ask it why a command failed or how to do something (<code>whai speed up this video</code>). It reads your recent terminal activity for context, suggests a command, explains it, and waits for your approval.</p> <h1>Why It\u2019s Different</h1> <p>Most AI terminal tools I tried didn't suit me: they either take over your entire shell (forcing you into a REPL) or run commands without supervision.</p> <p><code>whai</code> takes a different approach. It works inside your native shell, never interrupts you, and never runs a command without your explicit approval. The goal is to act as a helpful expert you can ask for help and learn from.</p> <h1>My Learning Experience</h1> <p>This was my first time building a distributable Python app, and the journey was a change from my typical data science workflow. And I got to leverage and adopt some new packages.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tooling:</strong> I fell in love with <code>uv</code> for its speed (bye <code>conda</code>) and extensive <code>pytest</code> testing. Combining this with with <code>nox</code> to automate testing across multiple Python versions feels like magic.</li> <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Setting up an automated CI/CD using tags pipeline is so nice to have. Having it use <code>uv</code>, <code>pytest</code> and <code>nox</code> really simplified publishing and gave me peace of mind.</li> </ul> <p>If you spend a lot of time in the terminal, you can check it out here:</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/gael-vanderlee/whai\">https://github.com/gael-vanderlee/whai</a></p> <p>You can install it with <code>uv tool install whai</code> (or <code>pipx</code> or <code>pip</code>) or try it without installing using <code>uvx whai &quot;your question&quot;</code>.</p> <p>Would love any feedback, ideas, or bug reports.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gueleric\"> /u/Gueleric </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxz29u/i_took_a_break_from_data_science_to_build_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxz29u/i_took_a_break_from_data_science_to_build_my/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Four phases and temporal threshold of population calcium response during locomotion in cortical astrocytes",
    "content": "Calcium activity is a major form of astrocyte excitability essential to their function and plasticity. Astrocytic calcium events arise both spontaneously and in response to behaviour. In this study, we examined how these unitary events shape population-level calcium activity during quiescence and locomotion. Using two-photon imaging of astrocytic calcium in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake mice running on a freely rotating disk, we found that spontaneous fluctuations during quiescence were driven mainly by the co-occurrence of new calcium events rather than by their enlargement. During locomotion, population responses progressed through four phases: the emergence of new events, their merging into a superevent, fragmentation of this superevent, and an afterburst. New events appeared immediately at locomotion onset, indicating a rapid astrocytic response. The response also exhibited a temporal threshold of ~5 seconds: when locomotion was shorter than this, the superevent phase failed to develop, and the population response was markedly reduced. In suprathreshold responses, the superevent displayed a {Delta}F/F intensity pattern that reproduced reliably across locomotion episodes. Hotspots within this pattern had shorter latencies and were also more active during quiescence, suggesting that the response is at least partly deterministic. Consistent with this, we were able to reproduce both the response phases and the superevent pattern using a dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model driven by synthetic or real locomotion inputs. Together, these findings dissect the population calcium response into quantifiable properties of unitary calcium events and reveal the formation and reproducibility of the superevent pattern, offering a potential framework for the astrocytic component of the engram.",

    "title": "Predicting stress response trajectories: Differential contributions of limbic and prefrontal regions to cortisol and affective responses",
    "content": "Why do individuals respond differently to stress? Since rodent studies indicated that stress regulation relies on limbic and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) outputs, we aimed to investigate whether data from these regions could also predict cortisol and affect trajectories following psychosocial stress in humans. In this pre-registered study, 281 healthy adults (145 female) were exposed to ScanSTRESS. Repeated assessments of salivary cortisol and negative affect were used to identify response trajectories (i.e. groups of participants) using latent class mixture modelling (LCMM). LCMMs without brain predictors were compared to LCMMs including structural (volume, thickness) and functional (activation, exposure-time effect) predictors from the amygdala, hippocampus, or mPFC regions. Results showed that cortisol LCMMs without brain predictors exhibited a single mean trajectory. Adding brain predictors resulted in three to four response trajectories, depending on region and outcome. Within identified models, cortisol hyper-response trajectories were predicted by larger amygdala and hippocampus volumes. Cortisol non-responses were predicted by greater amygdala activation and volume. Elevated baseline cortisol was predicted by higher hippocampal activation. mPFC markers did not predict cortisol trajectories, however, medial orbitofrontal cortex parameters identified affect response profiles mirroring trait-like affect. Together, our findings suggest dissociated roles of limbic and mPFC regions in stress regulation: While limbic structures predicted cortisol responses, the mPFC shaped affective experience.",

    "title": "Deep cerebellar tFUS engages cortical circuits via convergent local and sensory-driven mechanisms",
    "content": "Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) enables non-invasive access to deep brain structures with high spatial precision, but its mechanisms of action remain elusive and under active investigation. The leading hypothesis posits that tFUS exerts its neuromodulatory effects through direct activation of neurons, while others attribute effects to indirect activation of auditory pathways. Here, we investigated the neuromodulatory effects of tFUS on the dentato-thalamo-cortical (DTC) pathway by targeting either the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) or auditory cortex (AUD) in anesthetized rats. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from bilateral motor cortices and the contralateral auditory cortex revealed that tFUS reliably evoked cortical potentials, whereas sham stimulation produced no responses. Both LCN and AUD stimulation activated the auditory cortex, suggesting auditory pathway involvements. However, only LCN stimulation elicited early and significant event-related potentials and gamma-band activity in the contralateral motor cortex, consistent with DTC pathway engagement. We propose that LCN-targeted stimulation engages the DTC pathway through modulation of neuronal excitability, while concurrent auditory inputs account for global cortical activation. These results are consistent with a hybrid mechanism in which tFUS modulates neuronal dynamics, converging both direct and indirect components depending on the stimulation site. Proposed framework reconciles competing views of tFUS as either a direct or indirect modulator and clarifies how ultrasound can differentially influence cortical circuits depending on the stimulation target.",

    "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "The impact of unemployment on dream content.",
    "content": "This study examines the relationship between employment status and dream content using a data set of 6,478 dream reports collected from Reddit. We used machine learning to analyze thematic differences between unemployed individuals and a control group. The results revealed that the dreams of unemployed individuals demonstrated an underrepresentation of surprise and visual observations alongside an overrepresentation of work-related topics. These patterns suggest that unemployment is associated with distinct alterations in dream content, reflecting reduced cognitive engagement and heightened preoccupation with occupational concerns. This study establishes the feasibility of leveraging large-scale, publicly available data to explore the dream content of subpopulations.

    "content": "Previous theory suggested a relationship between fragmentation of the self-structure and nightmares. This article examines this possibility by providing an overview of the theoretical rationale for their relationship and a preliminary empirical study exploring the relationships between a brief measure of fragmentation proneness, distress, and nightmares among 307 undergraduate students. The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares. The results and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Anatomical connectivity-based parcellation of the human orbitofrontal cortex.",
    "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

    "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I'm building a VSCode extension that helps with understanding your codebase, particularly at a higher level where you need to figure out complex relationships between multiple files and modules.</p> <p>It helps you quickly get an overview of the area of the codebase you're interested in, and lets you see how files and folders relate to each other based on dependency.</p> <p>Kinda like a dependency graph, but it's the actual code files as the nodes, so you can see the actual code, you can ctrl+click on tokens like functions and variables to see their dependencies throughout the codebase, you can see the diffs for the local changes, and much more.</p> <p>Python support was the most requested feature so far and I just recently added it to the extension.</p> <p>I'm not a python dev, so I'm still learning how the language works, and would love any feedback from actual python devs if this type of visualisation is useful for you or if something else would be better. I'm using it for JS and I think it's really useful to see relationships between imports/exports, function usage and be able to follow props being passed down multiple levels, or a complex non-linear flow between multiple files.</p> <p>You can get it on the vscode marketplace by looking for 'code canvas app'.</p> <p>Or get it from this link <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alex-c.code-canvas-app\">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alex-c.code-canvas-app</a></p> <p>It uses VSCode's LSP for creating the edges between tokens so you need to have the python/pylance vscode extension installed as well.</p> <p>For the imports/exports edges and symbol outlines in the files when zooming out it uses ast-grep, which was just added recently and I've had a lot of issues with it, especially getting it to work on windows, but I think it should be fine now. Let me know if you encounter any issues.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Standard_Ant4378\"> /u/Standard_Ant4378 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxw0gf/added_python_support_for_my_vscode_extension_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxw0gf/added_python_support_for_my_vscode_extension_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Trial-Level Sequence Modeling Reveals Hidden Dynamics of Dual-Task Interference",
    "content": "Theories of dual-task interference assume that the same cognitive operations underlie multitasking regardless of stimulus timing, yet this core assumption has remained untested due to methodological limitations of behavioral averaging. Here, we combine hidden multivariate pattern (HMP) analysis with deep spatiotemporal sequence modeling of single-trial EEG to uncover the neural dynamics of multitasking in the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm. Using a deep spatiotemporal sequence model trained on Long stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) trials, we identify Encoding, Central, and Response operations and show that these same operations occur in the Short SOA condition, demonstrating shared cognitive processes across interference conditions. Additionally, trial-level decoding reveals multiple distinct sequences of cognitive operations across both tasks during interference, varying both within and across individuals. These sequences predict behavioral differences in reaction time and accuracy, revealing how interference timing within the cognitive operation sequence influences performance. In other words, we found trial-by-trial variability related to individual strategies directly affecting accuracy and reaction time (RT). Our findings challenge static bottleneck accounts and establish trial-level sequence modeling as a powerful tool to investigate the hidden dynamics of multitasking.",

    "title": "Fixel-Based Analysis reveals microstructural visual pathway changes associated with retinal remodeling in retinitis pigmentosa",
    "content": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy, traditionally considered a photoreceptor degenerative disorder. However, the relationship between retinal degeneration and structural alterations along central visual pathways remains poorly understood. We investigated possible structural links across the retinocortical pathway in 15 genetically characterized RP patients (RHO, PDE6A, PDE6B mutations) compared with 22 healthy controls, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) combined with diffusion-weighted MRI and fixel-based analysis (FBA). Retinal segmentation revealed marked outer layer thinning (outer nuclear layer: -55% foveal, -77% parafoveal) with significant inner layer thickening at the fovea (inner plexiform layer +29%, inner nuclear layer +40%). Parafoveal regions showed near-complete photoreceptor loss but inner retinal thickness approaching normal values. FBA demonstrated significant fiber density reductions in optic tracts and optic radiations, without corresponding macrostructural changes in tract cross-section, suggesting early microstructural disruption preceding atrophy. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between parafoveal inner plexiform layer thickness and fiber density in both optic tracts (r=0.856) and radiations (r=0.768), with no correlations observed at the foveal level. These findings demonstrate complex, region-specific retinal remodeling in RP, likely reflecting Muller cell gliosis rather than mechanical compensation. The fiber density reduction without tract atrophy suggests trans-synaptic degeneration along visual pathways. This multimodal framework provides insights into structural propagation in inherited retinal dystrophies and may serve as a biomarker for evaluating therapeutic interventions aimed at photoreceptor restoration.",

    "title": "Learning in nonstationary environments with minimal neuralcircuitry",
    "content": "Animals inhabit continually changing environments where it is not always possible to infer causes of relevant changes, such as the appearance of a new threat. In such nonstationary settings, learning a predictive model is challenging because a surprising observation could be due to chance, or due to systematic but uninferrable causes. This issue magnifies for short-lived animals with small nervous systems and limited opportunity to explore. To understand how the nervous system negotiates these challenges, we derived a new learning principle, Hetlearn (Heterologous Learners), based on the physiology and multi-compartmental architecture of the Drosophila mushroom body, a key associative learning circuit. Hetlearn circumvents learning full causal models of the environment, making it less fragile to nonstationarity. In stationary settings, Hetlearn is efficient and outperforms Bayesian inference when data are limited. Hetlearn predicts observed learning behaviour in Drosophila across multiple tasks and provides new, testable predictions about circuit interactions during learning.",

    "content": "In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), efficient remyelination is critical for functional recovery. Remyelination efficiency declines with age, and is linked to progressive disability. The gene regulatory network underlying remyelination, and how it is altered with aging, remains unclear. Here we present a comparative single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing analysis of remyelination in young and aged mice. We identified gene modules dynamically expressed throughout oligodendrocyte differentiation, revealing age-dependent changes in key processes related to myelination. Multi-omic analysis allowed us to map the regulatory network driving efficient remyelination within oligodendrocyte lineage cells in young mice. We highlight key transcription factors in the network dysregulated with age, and we describe similar dysregulations in MS lesions. Modifying the expression of these transcription factors in primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells impacts differentiation. These findings provide a foundational understanding of this regenerative process in the context of aging and in chronic demyelinating diseases.",

    "title": "Relative phase of membrane potential theta oscillations between individual hippocampal neurons code space",
    "content": "The timing of spikes dictates a neuron's impact on downstream circuits and behavior, and spike timing is determined by the membrane potential (Vm). However, due to technical challenges, it has been impossible to analyze the relative timing of Vm dynamics between neurons during behavior. Using large scale membrane voltage imaging, we simultaneously recorded Vm from many individual hippocampal neurons in animals engaged in a virtual spatial task. We found that relative phase of Vm theta oscillations across neurons exhibit gradual or discrete shifts depending on spatial position. This finding extends beyond previous studies showing Vm dynamics in single neurons or spiking activity in multiple neurons, revealing previously unknown evidence for consistent coding of space by spike-independent relative phase of Vm theta dynamics between neurons.",

    "title": "Context-specific configuration of orthogonal integrator dynamics for flexible foraging decisions",
    "content": "The capacity to adapt behavior across different contexts is a fundamental feature of intelligence and is crucial for animal life, yet the mechanisms by which neural circuits are contextually reconfigured to alter their function are poorly understood. As a universal, ecological behavior, foraging provides a natural window into the neural basis of decision making and cognitive flexibility. We developed complementary free-moving and virtual tasks in which mice make foraging decisions and switch between context-specific decision strategies by toggling distinct configurations of integrator dynamics for evidence accumulation. Neural recordings reveal brain-wide activity states recruited by foraging environments which organize divergent dynamics subspaces and orthogonal coding of context-specific decision variables in separate neural subpopulations. In the dorsal frontal cortex, this coding structure is preserved across experimental settings, supports rapid dynamics reconfiguration for volitional mode switching, and is functionally necessary for decision flexibility.",
