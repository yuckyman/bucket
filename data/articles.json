    "content": "arXiv:2511.17906v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Animation pre-production lays the foundation of an animated film by transforming initial concepts into a coherent blueprint across interdependent stages such as ideation, scripting, design, and storyboarding. While generative AI tools are increasingly adopted in this process, they remain isolated, requiring creators to juggle multiple systems without integrated workflow support. Our formative study with 12 professional creative directors and independent animators revealed key challenges in their current practice: Creators must manually coordinate fragmented outputs, manage large volumes of information, and struggle to maintain continuity and creative control between stages. Based on the insights, we present AnimAgents, a human-multi-agent collaborative system that coordinates complex, multi-stage workflows through a core agent and specialized agents, supported by dedicated boards for the four major stages of pre-production. AnimAgents enables stage-aware orchestration, stage-specific output management, and element-level refinement, providing an end-to-end workflow tailored to professional practice. In a within-subjects summative study with 16 professional creators, AnimAgents significantly outperformed a strong single-agent baseline that equipped with advanced parallel image generation in coordination, consistency, information management, and overall satisfaction (p < .01). A field deployment with 4 creators further demonstrated AnimAgents' effectiveness in real-world projects.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.17756v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Immigrants bring unique cultural backgrounds to their host countries. Subsequent interplay of cultures can lead to either a melting pot, where immigrants adopt the dominant culture of the host country, or a mosaic, where distinct cultural identities coexist. The existing literature primarily focuses on the acculturation of immigrants, specifically the melting pot hypothesis. In contrast, we attempt to identify the antecedents of the mosaic hypothesis or factors that enhance (or diminish) the propensity for cultural retention among immigrants. Based on Facebook advertising data for immigrants from 8 countries residing in the USA, our findings suggest that greater host-native distance is linked to higher online cultural retention, and while origin country context is statistically significant, its impact is generally smaller.",

    "title": "A Dynamic Take on Window Management",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.17516v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: On modern computers with graphical user interfaces, application windows are managed by a window manager, a core component of the desktop environment. Mainstream operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Apple's macOS employ window managers, where users rely on a mouse or trackpad to manually resize, reposition, and switch between overlapping windows. This approach can become inefficient, particularly on smaller screens such as laptops, where frequent window adjustments disrupt workflow and increase task completion time. An alternative paradigm, dynamic window management, automatically arranges application windows into non-overlapping layouts. These systems reduce the need for manual manipulation by providing intelligent placement strategies and support for multiple workspaces. Despite their potential usability benefits, dynamic window managers remain niche, primarily available on Linux systems and rarely enabled by default. This study evaluates the usability of dynamic window managers in comparison to conventional floating window systems. We developed a prototype dynamic window manager that incorporates configurable layouts and workspace management, and we conducted both heuristic evaluation and statistical testing to assess its effectiveness. Our findings indicate that dynamic window managers significantly improve task completion time in multi-window workflows by 37.83%. By combining cognitive heuristics with empirical performance measures, this work highlights the potential of dynamic window management as a viable alternative to traditional floating window systems and contributes evidence-based insights to the broader field of human-computer interaction (HCI).",

    "title": "Embedding Generative AI into Systems Analysis and Design Curriculum: Framework, Case Study, and Cross-Campus Empirical Evidence",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.17515v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Systems analysis students increasingly use Generative AI, yet current pedagogy lacks systematic approaches for teaching responsible AI orchestration that fosters critical thinking whilst meeting educational outcomes. Students risk accepting AI suggestions blindly or uncritically without assessing alignment with user needs or contextual appropriateness. SAGE (Structured AI-Guided Education) addresses this gap by embedding GenAI into curriculum design, training students when to accept, modify, or reject AI contributions. Implementation with 18 student groups across four Australian universities revealed how orchestration skills develop. Most groups (84\\%) moved beyond passive acceptance, showing selective judgment, yet none proactively identified gaps overlooked by both human and AI analysis, indicating a competency ceiling. Students strong at explaining decisions also performed well at integrating sources, and those with deep domain understanding consistently considered accessibility considerations. Accessibility awareness proved fragile. When writing requirements, 85\\% of groups explicitly considered elderly users and cultural needs. Notably, 55\\% of groups struggled identifying when AI misclassified system boundaries (what belongs inside versus outside the system), 45\\% missed data management errors (how information is stored and updated), and 55\\% overlooked missing exception handling. Three implications emerge for educators: (i) require students to document why they accepted, modified, or rejected each AI suggestion, making reasoning explicit; (ii) embed accessibility prompts at each development stage because awareness collapses without continuous scaffolding; and (iii) have students create their own specifications before using AI, then compare versions, and anchor to research or standards to identify gaps.",

Forty participants with no prior gaming experience were randomly assigned to 20 gender-matched teams of three (including one confederate) across two motivational climates: positive-supportive (PS) or neutral-unsupported (NU) (10 teams per condition). Team members completed three progressively difficult levels of Overcooked! 2 during which communication contents, emotional responses, collective efficacy, and performance outcomes were observed and coded. Mixed-design MANOVAs and ANOVAs were employed to examine the effects of motivational climate and task difficulty on communication patterns, emotions, collective efficacy, and performance. Chi-square analyses were performed to test communication content differences between conditions. Results revealed that PS team members significantly outperformed NU teams at lower task difficulty level, but this advantage diminished as task complexity increased. Communication analysis revealed that PS team members utilized significantly more action-oriented, factual, and emotional/motivational statements, while NU team members used more statements of uncertainty and non-task-related communication. The percentage of the talk time increased with difficulty across both climate conditions. PS team members maintained more positive emotional profiles throughout, with higher excitement and happiness scores and lower anxiety, dejection, and anger compared to NU team members. Furthermore, PS team members reported consistently higher collective efficacy beliefs across all difficulty levels. These findings reveal that positive motivational climate enhances team communication effectiveness, emotional resilience, and performance outcomes in challenging collaborative environments.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.17512v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mobile games have gained immense popularity due to their accessibility, allowing people to play anywhere, anytime. Dark patterns and deceptive designs (DPs) have been found in these and other gaming platforms within certain cultural contexts. Here, we explored DPs in the onboarding experiences of free-to-play mobile games from China and Japan. We identified several unique patterns and mapped their relative prevalence. We also found that game developers often employ combinations of DPs as a strategy (\"DP Combos\") and use elements that, while not inherently manipulative, can enhance the impact of known patterns (\"DP Enhancers\"). Guided by these findings, we then developed an enriched ontology for categorizing deceptive game design patterns into classes and subclasses. This research contributes to understanding deceptive game design patterns and offers insights for future studies on cultural dimensions and ethical game design in general.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.17511v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: To accelerate mechanical design and enhance design quality and innovation, we present a Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization (MDO) Agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). The agent semi-automates the end-to-end workflow by orchestrating three core capabilities: (i) natural-language-driven parametric modeling, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge-grounded conceptualization, and (iii) intelligent orchestration of engineering software for performance verification and optimization. Working in tandem, these capabilities interpret high-level, unstructured intent, translate it into structured design representations, automatically construct parametric 3D CAD models, generate reliable concept variants using external knowledge bases, and conduct evaluation with iterative optimization via tool calls such as finite-element analysis (FEA). Validation on three representative cases - a gas-turbine blade, a machine-tool column, and a fractal heat sink - shows that the agent completes the pipeline from natural-language intent to verified and optimized designs with reduced manual scripting and setup effort, while promoting innovative design exploration. This work points to a practical path toward human-AI collaborative mechanical engineering and lays a foundation for more dependable, vertically customized MDO systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.17509v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human-AI collaboration outcomes depend strongly on human self-confidence calibration, which drives reliance or resistance toward AI's suggestions. This work presents two studies examining whether calibration of self-confidence before decision tasks, low versus high levels of Need for Cognition (NFC), and Actively Open-Minded Thinking (AOT), leads to differences in decision accuracy, self-confidence appropriateness during the tasks, and metacognitive perceptions (global and affective). The first study presents strategies to identify well-calibrated users, also comparing decision accuracy and the appropriateness of self-confidence across NFC and AOT levels. The second study investigates the effects of calibrated self-confidence in AI-assisted decision-making (no AI, two-stage AI, and personalized AI), also considering different NFC and AOT levels. Our results show the importance of human self-confidence calibration and psychological traits when designing AI-assisted decision systems. We further propose design recommendations to address the challenge of calibrating self-confidence and supporting tailored, user-centric AI that accounts for individual traits.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.17508v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Augmented Reality (AR) applications often require robust real-time tracking of objects in the user's environment to correctly overlay virtual content. Recent advances in computer vision have produced highly accurate deep learning-based object trackers, but these models are typically too heavy in computation and memory for wearable AR devices. In this paper, we present a lightweight RGB object tracking algorithm designed specifically for resource-constrained AR platforms. The proposed tracker employs a compact Siamese neural network architecture and incorporates optimization techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to drastically reduce model size and inference cost while maintaining high tracking accuracy. We train the tracker offline on large video datasets using deep convolutional neural networks and then deploy it on-device for real-time tracking. Experimental results on standard tracking benchmarks show that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art trackers, yet runs in real-time on a mobile AR headset at around 30 FPS -- more than an order of magnitude faster than prior high-performance trackers on the same hardware. This work enables practical, robust object tracking for AR use-cases, opening the door to more interactive and dynamic AR experiences on lightweight devices.",

Indeed, the machine, now equipped with artificial intelligences requiring new appropriations and enabling new mediations, constitutes new challenges for artists. To study these confrontations and new mediations, our approach mobilizes the theoretical framework of the Human-AI Musicking Framework, based on a lexicometric analysis of content. The aim is to clarify the present and future uses of AI from the interfaces, in the creation of sound and musical content, and to identify the obstacles, obstacles, brakes and limits to appropriation ``in the fact of making the content one's own and integrating it as a part of oneself'' (Bachimont and Crozat, 2004) in the context of a collaboration between musician and machine.",

    "content": "arXiv:2409.17516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays. Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.11480v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.",

    "content": "arXiv:2404.01250v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Visual neural decoding from EEG has improved significantly due to diffusion models that can reconstruct high-quality images from decoded latents. While recent works have focused on relatively complex architectures to achieve good reconstruction performance from EEG, less attention has been paid to the source of this information. We present a unified framework that not only enables image reconstruction from EEG using a simple linear decoder, but also isolates interpretable EEG feature maps that support visual perception. Unlike prior approaches that rely on deep, opaque models, our method leverages the inherent structure of CLIP embeddings to keep the mapping linear. We show that training a simple linear decoder from EEG to CLIP latent space, followed by a frozen pre-trained diffusion model, is sufficient to decode images with state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Beyond reconstruction, Perceptogram enables the visualization of presumptive electrode preference and EEG patterns, revealing interpretable EEG feature maps that correspond to distinct visual attributes, such as semantic class, texture, and hue. We thus use our framework, Perceptogram, to probe EEG signals at various levels of the visual information hierarchy.",

    "title": "Robust Core-Periphery Constrained Transformer for Domain Adaptation",
    "content": "arXiv:2308.13515v5 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn transferable representation across domains. Recently a few UDA works have successfully applied Transformer-based methods and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. However, it remains challenging when there exists a large domain gap between the source and target domain. Inspired by humans' exceptional transferability abilities to adapt knowledge from familiar to uncharted domains, we try to apply the universally existing organizational structure in the human functional brain networks, i.e., the core-periphery principle to design the Transformer and improve its UDA performance. In this paper, we propose a novel brain-inspired robust core-periphery constrained transformer (RCCT) for unsupervised domain adaptation, which brings a large margin of performance improvement on various datasets. Specifically, in RCCT, the self-attention operation across image patches is rescheduled by an adaptively learned weighted graph with the Core-Periphery structure (CP graph), where the information communication and exchange between images patches are manipulated and controlled by the connection strength, i.e., edge weight of the learned weighted CP graph. Besides, since the data in domain adaptation tasks can be noisy, to improve the model robustness, we intentionally add perturbations to the patches in the latent space to ensure generating robust learned weighted core-periphery graphs. Extensive evaluations are conducted on several widely tested UDA benchmarks. Our proposed RCCT consistently performs best compared to existing works, including 88.3\\% on Office-Home, 95.0\\% on Office-31, 90.7\\% on VisDA-2017, and 46.0\\% on DomainNet.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.18294v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Neural decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) remains fundamentally limited by poor generalization to unseen subjects, driven by high inter-subject variability and the lack of large-scale datasets to model it effectively. Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \\textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings. Our work provides a reproducible and open-source foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding in real-world BCI systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.18853v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with ischemic strokes accounting for nearly 80% of cases. Fewer than 5% of patients receive the sole validated pharmacotherapy, intravenous thrombolysis, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. Within this landscape, the exploration of natural molecules emerges as a promising avenue, particularly as a means to address limitations associated with conventional drugs. Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, offer a compelling prospect for health and wellness. The term nutraceutical reflects their dual potential in nutrition and pharmacotherapy, emphasizing their relevance to both disease prevention and treatment. Interestingly, many were initially recognized as ''natural preconditioners'', substances that prime the body for protection against stress or damage. In fact, numerous nutraceuticals have been shown to activate protective pathways similar to those triggered by preconditioning across various organs. Among nutraceuticals, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sourced from plants or fish, along with polyphenols, have emerged as particularly promising. Their consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on cellular components within the neurovascular unit. This review explores the shared protective mechanisms of various nutraceuticals against key drivers of ischemic injury, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. By delineating these actions, the review highlights the potential of nutraceuticals as brain preconditioners that enhance neuroprotection, thereby mitigating the impact of cerebral ischemia in both preventive and therapeutic contexts.",

We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.",

Here, we investigate the mechanism using high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500+ trials) during P300 target recognition.\n  Phase Slope Index revealed zero-lag synchrony (PSI=0.000044, p=0.061) with high coherence (0.316, p<0.0001). Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs.\n  Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics.\n  Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration.

    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "MovieLite: A MoviePy alternative for video editing that is up to 4x faster",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>,</p> <p>I love the simplicity of MoviePy, but it often becomes very slow when doing complex things like resizing or mixing multiple videos. So, I built <strong>MovieLite</strong>.</p> <p>This started as a module inside a personal project where I had to migrate away from MoviePy due to performance bottlenecks. I decided to extract the code into its own library to help others with similar issues. It is currently in <strong>early alpha</strong>, but stable enough for my internal use cases.</p> <p><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/francozanardi/movielite\">https://github.com/francozanardi/movielite</a></p> <h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p>MovieLite is a library for programmatic video editing (cutting, concatenating, text overlays, effects). It delegates I/O to FFmpeg but handles pixel processing in Python.</p> <p>It is designed to be CPU Optimized using Numba to speed up pixel-heavy operations. Note that it is not GPU optimized and currently only supports exporting to MP4 (h264).</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>This is for Python Developers doing backend video automation who find MoviePy too slow for production. It is not a full-featured video editor replacement yet, but a faster tool for the most common automation tasks.</p> <h3>Comparison &amp; Benchmarks</h3> <p>The main difference is performance. Here are real benchmarks comparing MovieLite vs. MoviePy (v2.x) on a 1280x720 video at 30fps.</p> <p>These tests were run using 1 single process, and the same video codec and preset on both libraries, to ensure a fair comparison.</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Task</th> <th align=\"left\">MovieLite</th> <th align=\"left\">MoviePy</th> <th align=\"left\">Speedup</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\">No processing</td> <td align=\"left\">6.34s</td> <td align=\"left\">6.71s</td> <td align=\"left\">1.06x</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Video zoom</td> <td align=\"left\">9.52s</td> <td align=\"left\">31.81s</td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>3.34x</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Fade in/out</td> <td align=\"left\">8.53s</td> <td align=\"left\">9.03s</td> <td align=\"left\">1.06x</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Text overlay</td> <td align=\"left\">7.82s</td> <td align=\"left\">35.35s</td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>4.52x</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Video overlay</td> <td align=\"left\">18.22s</td> <td align=\"left\">75.47s</td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>3.14x</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Alpha video overlay</td> <td align=\"left\">10.75s</td> <td align=\"left\">42.11s</td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>3.92x</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Complex mix*</td> <td align=\"left\">38.07s</td> <td align=\"left\">175.31s</td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>4.61x</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Total</strong></td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>99.24s</strong></td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>375.79s</strong></td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>3.79x</strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p><em>\\</em>Complex mix includes: video with zoom + fade, image clips, text overlay, and video overlay composed together.*</p> <p><strong>Vs. FFmpeg (CLI):</strong> While raw FFmpeg commands are technically faster, MovieLite allows you to use Python logic (variables, loops, conditions) to define your edits, which is much harder to maintain with complex CLI strings.</p> <p><strong>Example Usage:</strong></p> <p>Here is how you would create a simple &quot;Picture-in-Picture&quot; effect with a fade-in:</p> <p>```python from movielite import VideoClip, VideoWriter, vfx</p> <h1>1. Main background video</h1> <p>bg_clip = VideoClip(&quot;background.mp4&quot;).subclip(0, 10)</p> <h1>2. Overlay video (Picture-in-Picture)</h1> <p>overlay = VideoClip(&quot;facecam.mp4&quot;).subclip(0, 10) overlay.set_scale(0.3) # Resize overlay.set_position((20, 20)) # Move to top-left overlay.add_effect(vfx.FadeIn(1.0))</p> <h1>3. Render mixing both clips</h1> <p>writer = VideoWriter(&quot;output.mp4&quot;, fps=30) writer.add_clip(bg_clip) writer.add_clip(overlay) writer.write() ```</p> <p><em>Note</em>: if you have multiple cores, you can do writer.write(processes=x) for faster rendering! It's specially useful for long output videos. For short videos, it will probably be overhead.</p> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback or suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_unknownProtocol\"> /u/_unknownProtocol </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5vkia/movielite_a_moviepy_alternative_for_video_editing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5vkia/movielite_a_moviepy_alternative_for_video_editing/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot.

As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs.

    "content": "Inappropriate externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) is a candidate mechanism of pathogenic neuroinflammation, a critical driver of neurodegenerative disease. ATP8A2, a flippase that maintains PS on the plasma membrane inner leaflet, is mutated in both Wabbler- lethal mice and patients with the ataxia syndrome CAMRQ4. Here, we identify ATP8A2 as a target of TDP-43 cryptic exon suppression, and demonstrate that ATP8A2 loss leads to immune-mediated neurodegeneration. ATP8A2 splicing is significantly dysregulated following TDP-43 depletion in human neurons and in brains of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS-FTD). In mice, Atp8a2 loss increases PS exposure and promotes neuroinflammation. Depletion of peripheral macrophages rescues motor axon degeneration and doubles Atp8a2 knockout mouse lifespan, while depletion of both peripheral macrophages and central microglia quadruples lifespan and improves coordination. Hence, ATP8A2 is a pathologically relevant TDP-43 target and inhibition of phagocytic immune cell attack against neurons is a potential treatment for patients with CAMRQ4 and ALS-FTD.",

    "title": "Negative-Valence Neurons in the Larval Zebrafish Pallium",
    "content": "An organism's survival depends on the rapid classification of sensory events as either harmful or beneficial. In mammals, this computation is partially performed by neurons in the amygdala that respond to signals with negative or positive valence. The larval zebrafish pallium is thought to contain homologs of the mammalian amygdala, isocortex, and hippocampus; however, the signals encoded by pallial neurons remain largely uncharacterized. Using two-photon light sheet microscopy to image 7-9 day old zebrafish that express pan-neuronal GCaMP6s, we recorded calcium dynamics throughout the brain while presenting a panel of strongly aversive stimuli, infrared heat, electric shock, and a whole-field looming shadow, together with milder threats including vibration, loud sound, light transitions, and a partial looming stimulus. A compact cluster of neurons in the rostrolateral dorsal pallium (Rl) responded vigorously to strongly noxious and fully looming stimuli, but not to the milder cues. In contrast, neurons in the ventromedial pallium and habenula responded to all stimuli tested. Rl neurons are marked by high expression of tiam2a, suggesting that they could be accessed genetically. Our results identify a dedicated negative valence locus in the teleost pallium and underscore evolutionary conservation of valence coding circuits.",

    "title": "Visual perceptual learning enhances functional connectivity in retinotopic space",
    "content": "Repeated exposure to perceptual tasks improves behavioral performance. Several neural mechanisms have been proposed to account for such perceptual learning. Computational modeling suggests that plasticity in the connectivity between cortical sites may be responsible, by increasing the fidelity with which task-relevant information is transmitted through sensory hierarchies. Here we explore this theory in humans using fMRI, testing the hypothesis that perceptual learning at one location in space will increase functional connectivity between voxels in visual areas that are tuned to that retinotopic location. Participants learned to detect one of two novel visual shape contours embedded in a noisy background in different visual quadrants. At baseline, there was no difference in behavioral sensitivity for the two shapes, nor a difference in functional connectivity between voxels in V1 and V4 responsive to the retinotopic locations of the two shapes. After training, there was a robust and selective improvement in perceptual detection of the trained shape relative to the control shape, along with increased functional connectivity between V1 and V4 voxels coding for the location of the trained shape in retinotopic space. Moreover, this increase in functional connectivity for the trained versus control shape predicted the improvement in behavioral sensitivity across participants. These results are consistent with the proposal that perceptual learning alters network dynamics so as to enhance the processing of behaviorally relevant information.",

    "content": "Plasma pTau217, an emerging Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker, may reflect a synaptic response to {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques before cortical tangle formation, but the broader biological processes at play remain unclear. Using whole blood RNAseq, we sought to identify gene expression associated with plasma pTau217 and to determine whether APOE{epsilon}4, sex, and neocortical A{beta}-PET burden further amplify these associations in 724 participants from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) Studies. 1,540 genes were moderated by A{beta}-PET, and 772 genes were moderated by both A{beta}-PET and sex. Our findings include genes previously associated with AD (e.g., TREML2) and implicate biological functions such as chromatin remodeling, lipid signaling, and RNA processing that interact with A{beta}-PET and sex to impact plasma pTau217. Our results underscore the complexity of molecular mechanisms that can be linked to plasma pTau217, particularly in the context of elevated A{beta}-PET.",

These built-in features required the project running a thread-safe python process that used libs like transformers, torch, safetensors, etc. 500M in dependencies, not to mention all the security vulnerabilities in the dep tree. Not hating on python, but our GH project was flagged with all sorts of issues.</p> <p>Those models are loaded as a separate out-of-process server via ollama/lama.cpp which you all know are built in C++/Go. Lighter, faster and safer. And ONLY if the developer uses these features of the product. This meant 9000 lines of less code, a total start time of &lt;2 seconds (vs 30+ seconds), etc.</p> <p>Why archgw? So that you can build AI agents in any language or framework and offload the plumbing work in AI (like agent routing/hand-off, guardrails, zero-code logs and traces, and a unified API for all LLMs) to a durable piece of infrastructure, deployed as a sidecar.</p> <p>Proud of this release, so sharing \ud83d\ude4f</p> <p>P.S Sample demos, the CLI and some tests still use python because would be most convenient for developers to interact with the project. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdditionalWeb107\"> /u/AdditionalWeb107 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5vpul/archgw_0320_500mbs_of_python_dependencies_gutted/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5vpul/archgw_0320_500mbs_of_python_dependencies_gutted/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Hippocampal Drift Rate Reflects the Temporal Organization of Memories",
    "content": "<p>When freely recalling past events, individuals tend to successively remember stimuli that were studied close together in time&mdash;a phenomenon known as temporal clustering. Temporal clustering is thought to occur because stimuli are encoded in relation to a slowly drifting internal context; this internal context representation is then reinstated during recall, leading to clustered recall of stimuli that share a similar internal context. While several lines of evidence implicate the hippocampus in supporting internal context representations, there is limited evidence directly linking hippocampal drift during memory encoding to subsequent temporal clustering during recall. In a human fMRI experiment (<i>n</i> = 38; 20 females and 18 males), we sought to influence the rate of internal context change during memory encoding and tested for corresponding effects on (1) temporal clustering and (2) hippocampal drift rate. To influence internal context, we manipulated the rate at which background scenes \"switched\" while a list of words was encoded. Afterward, subjects freely recalled as many words as possible. While switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering. Specifically, a higher switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern was mirrored by drift rate in the hippocampus: a higher switch rate was associated with significantly lower hippocampal autocorrelation (more drift). Moreover, individual differences in hippocampal autocorrelation were positively correlated with temporal clustering. Collectively, this suggests that hippocampal drift rate during encoding and temporal clustering during recall each reflects a common internal context representation.</p>",

    "title": "Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Enhances Ca2+-Dependent Electrical Activity in Lateral Cochlear Efferents",
    "content": "<p>Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages the cochlea and triggers downstream brain changes, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system; a feedback pathway originates in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. Recent evidence suggests that lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent system supports hearing recovery by sustaining auditory nerve activity for several weeks after acoustic trauma (Sitko et al., 2025); however, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we examined the long-term effects of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse LOC neurons of either sex. Under normal conditions, these neurons display a characteristic burst firing pattern driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated membrane voltage oscillations. One week following noise exposure, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, as a result of an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Moreover, LOC neurons exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents&mdash;a key process that shapes the duration of voltage oscillations&mdash;whose properties were also modified following noise exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation, CDI, and outward leak currents is sufficient to sustain the oscillating behavior of LOC neurons. We propose that NIHL increases efferent activity, thereby enhancing the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which may support long-lasting restoration of sensory coding in the damaged cochlea.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Listeners effortlessly extract multi-dimensional auditory objects, such as a localized talker, from complex acoustic scenes. However, the neural mechanisms that enable simultaneous encoding and linking of distinct sound features&mdash;such as a talker&rsquo;s voice and location&mdash;are not fully understood. Using invasive intracranial recordings in seven neurosurgical patients (four male, three female), we investigated how the human auditory cortex processes and integrates these features during naturalistic multi-talker scenes and how attentional mechanisms modulate such feature integration. We found that cortical sites exhibit a continuum of feature sensitivity, ranging from single-feature-sensitive sites (responsive primarily to voice spectral features or to location features) to dual-feature-sensitive sites (responsive to both features). At the population level, neural response patterns from both single- and dual-feature-sensitive sites jointly encoded the attended talker&rsquo;s voice and location. Notably, single-feature-sensitive sites encoded their primary feature with greater precision but also represented coarse information about the secondary feature. Sites selectively tracking a single, attended speech stream concurrently encoded both voice and location features, demonstrating a link between selective attention and feature integration. Additionally, attention selectively enhanced temporal coherence between voice- and location-sensitive sites, suggesting that temporal synchronization serves as a mechanism for linking these features. Our findings highlight two complementary neural mechanisms&mdash;joint population coding and temporal coherence&mdash;that enable the integration of voice and location features in the auditory cortex. These results provide new insights into the distributed, multi-dimensional nature of auditory object formation during active listening in complex environments.</p>",

    "title": "Motor Control Processes Moderate Visual Working Memory Gating",
    "content": "<p>Gating processes that regulate sensory input into visual working memory (WM) and the execution of planned actions share neural mechanisms, suggesting a mutual interaction. In a preregistered study (Open Science Framework), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed match-to-sample task. Participants (12 males, 20 females) memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a critical tool for assessing auditory brainstem function in biomedical mouse models. Remarkably, despite its importance, the origins of ABR waves specific to mice remain poorly identified. Here, we used EEG source reconstruction to reevaluate the mouse-specific ABR origins. We recorded the topography of ABRs using high-density EEG from the skull of adult mice of either sex combined with parallel multielectrode recordings in the auditory cortex. Individual ABR waves showed a series of distinct spatial topographies across the skull. Wave I&rsquo; was strongly lateralized, supporting its auditory nerve origin. Waves II/III were also lateralized but had a more frontal distribution, supporting an origin in the cochlear nucleus and olivary complex. A distinct shift in wave IV topography showed focused activity directly above the inferior colliculus (IC). Source localization with beamforming supported the origin of wave IV and V in the IC. In addition, the slow IC wave, P<sub>0</sub>, temporally overlapped with responses in the auditory cortex. We identify ABR wave IV as a marker of IC activity, separating earlier brainstem contributions (cochlear nucleus, olivary complex) from later thalamic and cortical components. This finding improves the anatomical specificity of the mouse ABR as a noninvasive marker in biomedical mouse models.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Aging affects the reproductive system, although its impact on GnRH neurons is mainly unexplored. Thus, we compared the transcriptome and electrophysiology of GnRH neurons obtained from female middle-aged (MA, 400&ndash;430&nbsp;d) and young (Y, 70&nbsp;d), diestrous mice, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reproductive senescence-related molecular changes in one-third of the MA mice. The upregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 225) were linked to immune signaling, olfactory- and vomeronasal receptors. The downregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 233) were related to mRNA processing, G-protein&ndash;coupled receptors, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport, and estrogen signaling. In addition, ion channel (Na, K, Ca), neurotransmitter (ACh, GABA, glutamate), and various neuropeptide receptor-coding genes showed differential expression indicating functional alterations of the cells. Accordingly, whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recordings revealed a twofold increase in spontaneous firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons. Significant changes were also observed in characteristics of action potentials and afterhyperpolarization amplitudes. Conspicuously, miniature postsynaptic currents were absent in 72% of MA-GnRH neurons, and pharmacological blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> and glutamate receptors didn't affect the firing rate. However, administration of their ligands evoked inward currents and facilitated firing in both animal groups, although with a decreased efficacy in MA animals. MA-GnRH neurons sustained responsiveness to estradiol, G-protein inhibition, and kisspeptin (KP) like those of young animals. While KP receptor antagonist, KP-234, diminished firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons, it had no effect on young GnRH cells. Collectively, these findings revealed that both the transcriptome and electrophysiological activity of GnRH neurons change at middle age and the explored alterations are hallmarks of early phase of reproductive senescence.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Humans have an automatic tendency to imitate others&rsquo; actions, a process facilitated by the action observation network (AON). While motor nodes of the AON, such as the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the supplementary motor area (SMA), are engaged during automatic imitation, the distinct roles of their projections to the primary motor cortex (M1) remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the plasticity and functional role of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in healthy humans of either sex. We used a combination of corticocortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to modulate cortical connectivity strength and drift diffusion modeling to study the impact of ccPAS on the latent cognitive processes underlying automatic imitation. Our results show that manipulating PMv-to-M1 connectivity increases the baseline tendency to imitate actions, shifting the response toward or away from an imitative response when connectivity in this circuit is enhanced or hindered, respectively. Conversely, strengthening SMA-to-M1 connectivity does not affect this bias but improves contextual information integration, facilitating task-appropriate behavior, reflected by the drift rate parameter. These findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the functional roles of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways: the former pathway drives the automatic imitation bias, while the latter modulates the integration of contextual information to regulate imitation. By combining network-based brain stimulation with advanced behavioral analysis, this study provides causal evidence for the distinct cognitive functions supported by the PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in the facilitation and regulation of automatic imitation. Our findings offer insights into the neural mechanisms governing imitation and its context-dependent modulation.</p>",

    "title": "Superior Colliculus Projections Drive Dopamine Neuron Activity and Movement But Not Value",
    "content": "<p>To navigate dynamic environments, animals must rapidly integrate sensory information and respond appropriately to gather rewards and avoid threats. It is well established that dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) are key for creating associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict. Critically, it remains unclear how sensory information is integrated into DA pathways. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is positioned as a relay for DA neuron augmentation. We characterized the anatomy and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA/SNc in male and female rats. First, we show that neurons in the deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing with projections to the striatum and ventral pallidum, and these SC projections excite DA and GABA neurons in the VTA/SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neuron activation did not reliably evoke behavior in an optogenetic pavlovian conditioning paradigm, and activation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference/avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons evokes head turning. Focusing optogenetic activation solely onto DA neurons that receive input from the SC was sufficient to invigorate turning, but not reinforcement. Turning intensity increased with repeated stimulations, suggesting that this circuit may underlie sensorimotor learning for exploration and attentional switching. Together, our results show that collicular neurons contribute to cue-guided behaviors by controlling pose adjustments through interaction with DA neurons that preferentially engage movement instead of reward.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Toni and Pablo, and we're building Karumi (<a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai\">https://www.karumi.ai</a>), a system that lets your users get instant, scalable, guided demos of your product, fully automated, zero human interaction. It works in any language.<p>Here's a demo video: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd</a>. There's also a live demo at  <a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz\">https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz</a>.<p>Karumi is an AI agent that operates a real web app in a shared browser session and talks the user through it. Instead of a human giving a screen-share demo, the agent opens your product, clicks around, fills forms, and explains what it\u2019s doing. We started building this as an internal tool at our previous company. As the product grew, people kept asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the right way to demo feature X?\u201c. Docs and scripts became outdated quickly, and the quality of demos depended too much on who was presenting. We wanted something closer to a repeatable program: an agent that knows the main flows, understands who it\u2019s talking to, and can walk through the product without getting lost.<p>Over time this turned into three main components:<p>Planning/control layer<p>A loop that decides the next step: ask something, click, navigate, reset, etc. It uses a reasoning model, but only within a fixed set of allowed actions with guards (timeouts, depth limits, reset states). It never gets free control of the browser.<p>Browser execution layer<p>A controlled browser session, streamed in a video call. The agent can only interact with the elements we want. We log each action with a timestamp and the agent\u2019s \u201creason\u201d, which helps debug odd behavior.<p>Product knowledge layer<p>We ingest docs, demo scripts & videos, and usage analytics, to train the agent. At runtime, the agent uses its knowledge to decide what flow to show and how to explain it.<p>Some practical details and limitations:<p>We only support web apps right now. Desktop apps will come next.\nLLMs introduce non-determinism, so we bias toward safe, predictable behavior: checkpoints, conservative navigation, and \u201cescape hatches\u201d that reset to known states.\nIf the agent doesn\u2019t understand a UI state (unknown modal, layout shift, etc.), it asks the user instead of guessing.\nRegarding pricing, it\u2019s still early. We tailor it to each customer based on their needs. Our current thinking is a platform fee plus a per-call charge for the agent. The platform fee varies depending on complexity, support requirements, and overall scope.<p>People currently use Karumi for inbound demos and internal demo environments. If you want to see it inside a real product, here\u2019s Karumi running in Deel\u2019s platform: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd</a><p>We\u2019ll be around to answer questions and look forward to your feedback!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037416\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037416</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>",

    "title": "Launch HN: Karumi (YC F25) \u2013 Personalized, agentic product demos",
    "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Toni and Pablo, and we're building Karumi (<a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai\">https://www.karumi.ai</a>), a system that lets your users get instant, scalable, guided demos of your product, fully automated, zero human interaction. It works in any language.<p>Here's a demo video: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd</a>. There's also a live demo at  <a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz\">https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz</a>.<p>Karumi is an AI agent that operates a real web app in a shared browser session and talks the user through it. Instead of a human giving a screen-share demo, the agent opens your product, clicks around, fills forms, and explains what it\u2019s doing. We started building this as an internal tool at our previous company. As the product grew, people kept asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the right way to demo feature X?\u201c. Docs and scripts became outdated quickly, and the quality of demos depended too much on who was presenting. We wanted something closer to a repeatable program: an agent that knows the main flows, understands who it\u2019s talking to, and can walk through the product without getting lost.<p>Over time this turned into three main components:<p>Planning/control layer<p>A loop that decides the next step: ask something, click, navigate, reset, etc. It uses a reasoning model, but only within a fixed set of allowed actions with guards (timeouts, depth limits, reset states). It never gets free control of the browser.<p>Browser execution layer<p>A controlled browser session, streamed in a video call. The agent can only interact with the elements we want. We log each action with a timestamp and the agent\u2019s \u201creason\u201d, which helps debug odd behavior.<p>Product knowledge layer<p>We ingest docs, demo scripts & videos, and usage analytics, to train the agent. At runtime, the agent uses its knowledge to decide what flow to show and how to explain it.<p>Some practical details and limitations:<p>We only support web apps right now. Desktop apps will come next.\nLLMs introduce non-determinism, so we bias toward safe, predictable behavior: checkpoints, conservative navigation, and \u201cescape hatches\u201d that reset to known states.\nIf the agent doesn\u2019t understand a UI state (unknown modal, layout shift, etc.), it asks the user instead of guessing.\nRegarding pricing, it\u2019s still early. We tailor it to each customer based on their needs. Our current thinking is a platform fee plus a per-call charge for the agent. The platform fee varies depending on complexity, support requirements, and overall scope.<p>People currently use Karumi for inbound demos and internal demo environments. If you want to see it inside a real product, here\u2019s Karumi running in Deel\u2019s platform: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd</a><p>We\u2019ll be around to answer questions and look forward to your feedback!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037416\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037416</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>",

    "title": "Characterization of hippocampal subfields using histology-based annotated postmortem MRI: Lessons for in vivo segmentation II",
    "content": "High-resolution in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hippocampal subfields is a rapidly advancing field due to their implication in cognition, disorder, and disease. Hippocampal subfield segmentation on in vivo MRI is generally guided by postmortem reference material, which has been limited by small sample sizes that preclude comprehensive characterization of subfield border locations and their variability. Addressing this, we characterized hippocampal subfield border variability in two ultra-high-resolution postmortem MRI datasets with combined annotated histological sections, including cases with and without dementia. We examined: 1) the order of appearance and disappearance of subfields along the long axis of the hippocampus; 2) the order of appearance and disappearance of subicular subregions; 3) the medial-lateral position of subicular subregional boundaries along the hippocampal body; 4) the location of the CA3 relative to hippocampal head digitations; 5) the subfield borders in the hippocampal body relative to a volume proportion of the dark band; and 6) the association of hippocampal length and subiculum-CA1 border location with diagnosis, demographic factors, and factors related to postmortem imaging. Our findings reaffirmed that there is a consistent order of appearance and disappearance of subfields in the hippocampal head and tail, respectively. The subicular subregions exhibited a \"first in, last out\" order of appearance and disappearance, and pre/parasubiculum consistently occupied half of the subicular complex in coronal slices throughout the hippocampal body. Hippocampal head digitations were not a reliable landmark for CA3 appearance, but SRLM proportionality did offer a potentially consistent approach for estimating CA2 and CA3 subfield borders in relation to the hippocampal border. No clear relationship was found between the anatomical features and diagnosis, demographic factors, and factors related to postmortem imaging. These findings have implications for the development and harmonization of hippocampal subfield segmentation protocols and interpretation of high-resolution functional MRI studies of the human hippocampus.",

    "title": "Less is more: uncompensated gravity torques for intuitive EMG-based assistance with a robotic exoskeleton",
    "content": "Despite extensive investigation on the use of electromyographic (EMG) activity to control active exoskeletons over the past decade, designing intuitive assistive controllers that seamlessly integrate with natural human motor control have yet to be realized. While existing EMG-based controllers often achieve substantial reduction in muscle effort, they frequently incur increased cognitive and attentional load for the user, thereby compromising the overall efficacy of the assistance. Here we introduce a novel EMG-based assistive controller founded upon neuroscience principles, specifically the observation that humans naturally exploit gravity torque to facilitate movement control. Therefore, deviating from conventional compensation strategies, our approach purposely leaves a fraction of the predicted human gravity torque uncompensated so that users can still take advantage of gravity as they would without assistance. Through a load-carrying arm movement task, we show that enabling gravity exploitation improves traditional EMG-based assistance by achieving a significant reduction in muscle effort, while concurrently yielding superior kinematic performance (i.e., faster, smoother movements) and enhanced subjective user experience. These findings demonstrate that integrating principles from neural motor control into assistive controllers allows to implement a favorable tradeoff between muscle effort reduction and functional usability.",

    "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
    "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

    "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Neurobehavioral concomitants of alcohol use in older healthy adults",
    "content": "Few laboratory studies permitting granular analyses of alcohol use on neurobehavioral processes in older adults have been reported. This study, reporting baseline data from an on-going longitudinal project, seeks to address this gap. Toward that end, working memory (WM) processes were targeted using the continuous recognition version of the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). Healthy male and female drinkers aged 65\u201380 years completed self-report measures of substance use, negative affect and demographics prior to testing. Drinking patterns were quantified on the basis of typical standard drinks/day (D/D). Behavioral data were obtained in a two-button forced choice paradigm. Neurophysiological data were obtained for each stimulus presentation with analyses focusing on a mid-frontal negative shift occurring \u223c 300\u2013500 ms post stimulus (FN400) and a posterior positive shift occurring \u223c 550\u2013800 ms after stimulus presentation (LPC). To constrain the models, for the behavioral analyses correlations between D/D, measures of negative affect, stimulus condition (\u201cnew,\u201d \u201cidentical,\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d) and performance were conducted. They indicated that only accuracy in labeling \u201cnew\u201d items was related to D/D. Subsequent least squares regression revealed that D/D was inversely related to accuracy for new items. In a sensitivity analysis removing THC users, the D/D effect was retained. Correlations incorporating mean amplitudes for the FN400 and LPC failed to reveal identifiable patterns. Consequently, separate mixed models (e.g., stimulus condition) for FN400 and LPC were conducted. D/D was not predictive of the FN400 for any stimulus condition. It was negatively related to the LPC mean amplitude. In post-hoc analyses, the effect was most notable for \u201cnew\u201d stimuli. After removing THC users, the magnitude and direction of the D/D effect was retained, although the p value fell short of significance. Primary models failed to reveal sex main or interaction effects. However, exploratory post-hoc analyses justify their continued study. These data lend preliminary support for the hypothesis that sustained drinking among older adults may negatively impact neurobehavioral processes. They are also consistent with expectations that alcohol effects may be modest and constrained by specific process. Importantly, these outcomes will be expanded through on-going longitudinal study, extending investigation to study of alcohol-related cognitive decline.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "title": "A computational framework combining neuronal dynamics and evolutionary game theory for network-level synaptic interactions",
    "content": "Objective. In this study, we present a novel computational framework that combines the Hindmarsh\u2013Rose (HR) neuronal model with evolutionary game theory on networks to simulate and interpret synaptic-level interactions within neuronal populations. Our approach preserves the features of the HR model\u2014capable of generating both spiking and bursting dynamics\u2014while integrating game-theoretic principles that govern the balance between emulative and non-emulative behaviors across neurons. Approach. Neurons were modeled as strategic agents whose interactions evolve according to game-theoretic principles, allowing us to capture emergent network dynamics beyond classical electrophysiological analyses. A key innovation of our work is the formulation of a parameter estimation method based on adaptive observers, which enables the recovery of game-theoretic parameters solely from partial state observations. The proposed framework is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability to recover hidden parameters and accurately predict system behavior under diverse conditions. Main results. By applying the devised approach to synthetic datasets mimicking real electrophysiological recordings, we highlight its applicability in distinguishing neuronal populations based on their strategic interactions. In this context, the model is shown to faithfully reproduce both spiking and bursting behaviors, capturing the diverse electrophysiological patterns observed in in vitro experimental settings. Furthermore, we explore the potential of this model in experimental data analysis by suggesting that the estimated parameters may serve as discriminative markers for different neuronal types and structural characteristics. Significance. The integration of dynamical systems theory, game-theoretic modeling, and adaptive estimation provides a robust quantitative tool for investigating complex neuronal network dynamics. Our results quantitatively demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of the method in parameter estimation, reinforcing its value for systematic analysis of synaptic interactions and advancing our understanding of neuronal network dynamics.",

    "title": "Patient-specific long-term seizure prediction via multi-model classification",
    "content": "Objective. Most existing seizure prediction approaches rely on cohort-based models or assume a single model suffices per patient, overlooking clinical and electrophysiological variability across seizures. This study aims to overcome these limitations by introducing a subject-specific seizure prediction framework that models intra-subject heterogeneity by identifying and clustering seizure-specific preictal patterns using long-term intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected over a one to two week duration. Approach: Absolute, relative, and ratio power spectral density features are extracted from twelve frequency bands, and the minimum uncertainty and sample elimination algorithm is used for unsupervised feature selection on a per-seizure basis. Weighted aggregation is then applied to form seizure-specific feature sets. Seizures are grouped into clusters based on feature similarity, and separate classifiers are trained for each cluster. Model predictions are combined using a grid optimized k-of-N voting strategy. Evaluation is conducted on long-term iEEG recordings from ten patients using cross-validation across seizure-containing sessions. Main results. When clustering is applied, the mean sensitivity across subjects is improved from 89.17% to 98.54%, while the mean FPR is reduced from 1.15/day to 0.62/day. Additionally, the median number of features required per subject decreased from 22 to 14, reflecting a 36.4% reduction in model complexity. Finally, in 72.5% of subject-folds, the number of algorithm-identified clusters equaled or exceeded the clinically annotated seizure types, with a linear trend indicating latent electrophysiological variability beyond clinical labels. Significance. These findings highlight the value of modeling seizure diversity within individuals and support the development of more personalized and interpretable seizure forecasting systems.",

    "content": "<p>Easy to use, portable app to play midi music files on all flavours of Microsoft Windows.<p>Brief Background - Used midi playback way back in the days of Windows 95 for some fun and entertaining apps, but as Windows progressed, it seemed their midi support (for Win32 anyway) regressed in both startup speed and reliability.  Midi playback used to be near instant on Windows 95, but on later versions of Windows this was delayed to about 5-7 seconds.  And reliability became somewhat patchy.  This made working with midi a real headache.<p>Cynthia was built to test and enjoy midi music once again.  It's taken over a year of solid coding, recoding, testing, re-testing, and a lot more testing, and some hair pulling along the way, but finally Cynthia works pretty solidly on Windows now.<p>Some of Cynthia's Key Features:\n* 25 built-in sample midis on a virtual disk - play right out-of-the box\n* Play Modes: Once, Repeat One, Repeat All, All Once, Random\n* Play \".mid\", \".midi\" and \".rmi\" midi files in 0 and 1 formats\n* Realtime track data indicators, channel output volume indicators with peak hold, 128 note usage indicators\n* Volume Bars to display realtime average volume and bass volume levels\n* Use an Xbox Controller to control Cynthia's main functions \n* Large list capacity for handling thousands of midi files\n* Switch between up to 10 midi playback devices in realtime\n* Playback through a single midi device, or multiple simultaneous midi devices with lag and channel output support\n* Custom built midi playback engine for high playback stability\n* Custom built codebase for low-level work to GUI level\n* Also runs on Linux/Mac (including apple silicon) via Wine\n* Smart Source Code - compiles in Borland Delphi 3 and Lazarus 2 \n* MIT License<p>YouTube Video of Cynthia playing a midi:\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/IDEOQUboTvQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/IDEOQUboTvQ</a><p>GitHub Repo:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/blaiz2023/Cynthia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/blaiz2023/Cynthia</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46034145\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46034145</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Universal differential equations as a unifying modeling language for neuroscience",
    "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

It was blocked by upstream issues on Polars side, but those have now been resolved. Development is restarting!</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/geopolars/geopolars\">GeoPolars</a> is a high-performance library designed to extend the Polars DataFrame library for use with geospatial data. Written in Rust with Python bindings, it utilizes the GeoArrow specification for its internal memory model to enable efficient, multithreaded spatial processing. By leveraging the speed of Polars and the zero-copy capabilities of Arrow, GeoPolars aims to provide a significantly faster alternative to existing tools like GeoPandas, though it is currently considered a prototype.</p> <p>Development on the project is <a href=\"https://github.com/geopolars/geopolars/issues/245#issuecomment-3568363838\">officially resuming</a> after a period of inactivity caused by upstream technical blockers. The project was previously stalled waiting for <a href=\"https://github.com/pola-rs/polars\">Polars</a> to support &quot;Extension Types,&quot; a feature necessary to persist geometry type information and Coordinate Reference System (CRS) metadata within the DataFrames. With the Polars team now actively implementing support for these extension types, the primary hurdle has been removed, allowing the maintainers to revitalize the project and move toward a functional implementation.</p> <p>The immediate roadmap focuses on establishing a stable core architecture before expanding functionality. Short-term goals include implementing Arrow data conversion between the underlying Rust libraries, setting up basic spatial operations to prove the concept, and updating the Python bindings and documentation. The maintainers also plan to implement basic interoperability with GeoPandas, Shapely, and GDAL. Once this foundational structure is in place and data sharing is working, the project will actively seek contributors to help expand the library's suite of spatial operations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Balance-\"> /u/Balance- </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5dtvn/geopolars_is_unblocked_and_moving_forward/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5dtvn/geopolars_is_unblocked_and_moving_forward/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Independent Lateralization of Language, Attention, and Numerical Cognition Across Task and Rest",
    "content": "Hemispheric functional complementarity is a core organizational principle of the human brain, yet the extent to which lateralization in one domain constrains that of others remains unclear. Two main accounts have been proposed: the causal hypothesis, in which dominance for one function drives complementary dominance in another, and the statistical hypothesis, in which each function lateralizes independently. Using multimodal fMRI in 287 participants from the BIL&amp;GIN cohort, we examined whether language lateralization phenotypes, defined as typical (left-dominant) or atypical (right-dominant), predict hemispheric asymmetries in visuospatial attention and numerical cognition. Task-based activation was measured during line bisection, mental calculation, and numerical interval comparison, and analyzed within domain-specific, functionally defined network atlases. Resting-state functional connectivity metrics were also assessed in the same networks. Across both attention and numerical domains, typical individuals for language showed stronger asymmetries, whereas atypical individuals exhibited weaker, more bilateral patterns. Critically, atypical participants did not show mirror-reversed asymmetries, and language phenotype did not influence intrinsic connectivity metrics in non-language networks. These findings challenge the notion that atypical lateralization represents an inversion of the canonical template and argue against a universal reciprocal link between language dominance and other cognitive domains. Instead, our results support a domain-specific model in which lateralization profiles are shaped by distinct developmental and functional constraints, highlighting the need for multimodal, multi-domain approaches to brain asymmetry.",

    "content": "Cortical layer 1 plays an essential role for brain function, integrating many streams of information and undergoing synaptic plasticity during learning. Yet, we understand little of the underlying molecular processes, and whether they are specialized to achieve layer-specific functions. Here, we show that layer 1 and its synapses are metabolically active. Using laser capture RNA-sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we report an abundance of synaptic transcripts localized to layer 1. We purified layer 1 excitatory and inhibitory synapses and characterized their enriched transcriptomes, identifying candidate proteins that can be locally synthesized to maintain and regulate synaptic transmission in layer 1. Furthermore, we find significant differences between the transcriptome of synapses in layer 1 and in deeper, somatic layers, suggesting that local translation might confer specialized function. Finally, by comparing our tissue data with the transcriptome from the hippocampal CA1 strata, we discover a strong similarity between cortical layer 1 and stratum lacunosum moleculare, suggesting that these distal layers share a common molecular environment. Together, our results establish that local protein synthesis is an important mechanism for layer 1, and provide the first comprehensive characterization of the transcripts localized to layer 1 and its synapses.",

    "content": "The basal ganglia are interconnected subcortical nuclei with complex topographical organization that orchestrate goal-directed behaviors and are implicated in neurodegenerative movement disorders. We generated a cellular-resolution, spatial transcriptomic atlas of the basal ganglia in human, rhesus macaque, and common marmoset, sampling over one million cells in each species. By integrating spatial data with a cross-species, consensus snRNA-seq cell type taxonomy, this atlas reveals conserved principles of molecular organization within and across structures. The cellular architecture is complex but highly stereotyped, with gene expression gradients superimposed onto discrete compartments. Extensive spatial sampling illuminates 3D gradients of molecular organization in the striatum and reveals cell type-specific core and shell compartments in the primate internal globus pallidus, which is conserved with mouse. This unified, cross-species spatial transcriptomic atlas will be a foundational resource for characterizing the molecular and functional organization of the basal ganglia and their roles in health and disease.",

    "content": "Mammalian brain cell identity is shaped by intrinsic factors and external context. We present a spatially resolved transcriptomic and gene regulatory atlas of cell types found across all subcortical brain regions in a primate - the marmoset monkey. Dense sampling and cross-species integrations revealed spatially precise neuronal assemblies, including in complex structures such as hypothalamus. We find chromatin accessibility and transcriptional identity are spatially tuned within and across subcortical structures. Spatial gradients within subfields of the hippocampal formation are predominantly orchestrated by graded transcription factors coupled with graded enhancers. The primate-expanded population of GABAergic neurons in the thalamus shares transcriptional and regulatory syntax with neurons in superior colliculus, reflecting an evolutionary adaptation compared with rodents. We show that unexpected transcriptional convergence, such as between striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons and telencephalic glutamatergic neurons, can arise when distinct gene regulatory networks impinge on the same downstream genes.",

    "content": "Animals encounter a barrage of sensory stimuli, but only a subset of these are associated with appetitive outcomes, highlighting the importance of neural mechanisms for learning to distinguish reward-paired from unpaired cues. The ventral striatum plays a critical role in both reinforcement learning and stimulus discrimination, but the effect of learning on the selectivity of different cell types remains unclear. Here we examined ventral striatal D1 and D2 medium spiny neuron (MSN) firing properties as mice learned to distinguish between reward-paired and unpaired cues. As learning progressed within a single session, D1 MSN selectivity increased linearly with behavioral selectivity, while D2 MSNs exhibited only modest, behaviorally uncorrelated changes in activity. Altered D1 MSN selectivity was primarily attributed to attenuated excitatory responses to the unrewarded cue, and increasing D1 MSN activity during the unrewarded cue impaired behavioral selectivity. Together, these findings reveal significantly more dynamic contributions of D1 MSNs to stimulus discrimination learning.",

    "content": "Background: Mindfulness meditation has gained significant attention in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its potential effects on the prevention of cognitive decline and overall psychological well-being. The epigenetic landscape of this complex neurodegenerative disorder can be influenced by environmental factors. Mindfulness practices could actively shape the biological response to AD by modifying the underlying molecular mechanisms through epigenetic regulation. Methods: A group of 17 long-term mindfulness meditators (MMs) and 17 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited. Experienced MMs participated in a 1-month Vipassana meditation retreat. Blood DNA methylation levels of differentially methylated genes (ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3, NXN, TREM2 and TREML2) previously validated in a predictive AD-model found analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Results: An increase in DNA methylation was observed for ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3 and TREM2 in MMs with respect to controls. Furthermore, significant differences were found for ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE and HOXA3 in MMs after retreat. Conclusions: DNA methylation changes identified for ADAM10 and HOXA3 in MMs are in the opposite direction to those occurring in AD and may constitute a protective epigenetic alteration. Mindfulness practice could counteract DNA methylation of key AD genes as a possible preventive strategy or non-pharmacological intervention in AD patients.",

    "title": "Comparative Analysis of FOXP2 Expression in the Thalamus of Mice, Rats, and Macaques: Implications for the Evolution of Language Circuits.",
    "content": "FOXP2 is a transcription factor essential for the development and function of neural circuits involved in language. Although its expression has been extensively characterized in the cortex and basal ganglia, its organization within the adult thalamus remains poorly understood. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of FoxP2 protein expression across thalamic nuclei in mice, rats, and macaques, with a focus on nuclei associated with higher-order cognitive functions and language-related circuits in humans. We found that FoxP2 is expressed in most thalamic nuclei across species, with a consistent absence in the reticular nucleus and zona incerta. Expression was highest in midline and intralaminar nuclei, whereas the anterior group showed low and variable expression among species. Macaques exhibited broader and, in some nuclei, more intense FoxP2 expression, particularly in associative regions such as the pulvinar, lateral geniculate, and parts of the ventral group, indicating increased specialization of thalamocortical pathways. This distribution suggests a conserved role for FoxP2 in shaping thalamic circuits supporting sensorimotor integration, attention, memory, and linguistic processing. Phylogenetic comparisons further indicate that enhanced FoxP2 expression in associative thalamic territories in primates, likely intensified in humans, may have contributed to the evolution of neural circuits required for speech and language. These findings provide molecular and anatomical insights into how FoxP2 helps organize thalamocortical networks relevant both to language function and to neuropsychiatric disorders involving thalamocortical dysconnectivity.",

    "title": "WWOX deficiency uncovers a cell-autonomous mechanism impairing myelin repair",
    "content": "Remyelination is essential for neuronal function and plasticity, and its failure contributes to multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, the molecular programs governing oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and remyelination remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) as a critical cell-autonomous regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin repair. Reanalysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing from MS lesions revealed WWOX as one of the most significantly dysregulated oligodendroglial genes. Conditional deletion of Wwox in oligodendroglia impaired OPC differentiation, favouring aberrant proliferation and blocking myelin regeneration after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Single-nucleus transcriptomics confirmed profound transcriptional reprogramming in WWOX-deficient oligodendroglia during remyelination, with enrichment of WNT and TGFb; signalling and cell cycle programs. Mechanistically, WWOX physically interacts with the master transcription factor SOX10 via its WW1 domain, stabilising SOX10 protein and sustaining its downstream myelin gene network. Loss of WWOX reduced SOX10 stability and activity, providing a direct mechanistic link to defective OPC differentiation. Together, our findings uncover WWOX as an essential orchestrator of remyelination and position the WWOX-SOX10 axis as a promising therapeutic target for enhancing myelin repair in MS and related demyelinating disorders.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m Paul. I\u2019m building Syd, an offline-first forensic workstation that orchestrates tools like YARA and Nmap through a GUI, using a local LLM to analyze the results without leaking data. It runs completely offline on localhost\u2014no data is ever sent to the cloud, making it safe for sensitive investigations.<p>Here's a demo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dQV3JbLrRE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dQV3JbLrRE</a>.<p>I built this because while tools like YARA are powerful, managing rule sets and decoding hex strings is slow. AI is great at explaining malware signatures, but I couldn't use ChatGPT for my work because pasting potential malware or sensitive logs into a web form is a massive security risk. I needed the intelligence of an LLM but with the privacy of an air-gapped machine.<p>Under the hood, it\u2019s built on Python 3. I use subprocess to manage the heavy lifting of the scanning engines so the UI (built with CustomTkinter) doesn't freeze. The \"secret sauce\" isn't the AI itself, but the parser I wrote that converts the unstructured text output from YARA into a structured JSON format that the local LLM can actually understand and reason about.<p>I\u2019ve been using it to triage files for my own learning. In one case, Syd flagged a file matching a \"SilentBanker\" rule and the AI pointed out specific API calls for keylogging, saving me about 20 minutes of manual hex-editing. In the demo video linked, you can see this workflow: scanning a directory, hitting on a custom YARA rule, and having the local AI immediately analyze the strings.<p>Through this process, I learned that \"AI wrappers\" are easy, but AI orchestration is hard\u2014getting the tools to output clean data for the LLM is the real challenge. I'd love to hear if there are other static analysis tools (like PEStudio or Capa) you consider essential for a workstation like this, or how you currently handle the privacy risk of using AI for log analysis.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46031208\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46031208</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

    "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

    "content": "The concept of connectome gradients, which represents the continuous spatial variation of brain connectivity, offers a robust framework for exploring the hierarchical organization of the cortex and its relationship with cognitive function. We hypothesize that structural gradients in frontal and parietal regions play a significant role in shaping individual cognitive abilities during early childhood. To evaluate this hypothesis, we identified macroscale structural connectome gradients in children aged 1\u20136 years, where the principal gradient exhibited a left-to-right axis, and the secondary gradient exhibited an anterior-to-posterior axis. Next, we employed machine learning approaches to predict the future cognitive outcomes assessed at ages 4, 6, and 8, specifically intelligence quotient (IQ), based on the structural connectome gradients measured at age 1. We achieved consistent and robust prediction results (mean Spearman's correlation > 0.25). The regional relevance maps highlighted regions in control network, and associated sensory processing networks. Our findings indicate that the structural connectome, which undergoes maturation during early childhood, plays a crucial role in the individual variability of IQ observed in early and middle childhood. Our approach underscores the utility of structural gradients as compact and interpretable representations of the brain's complex network architecture, effectively capturing individual differences that contribute to cognitive development.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "content": "Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding plays a critical role in brain\u2013computer interfaces but remains challenging due to large inter-subject variability and limited training data. Existing approaches often struggle with few-shot cross-subject adaptation, as they require either extensive fine-tuning or fail to capture individualized neural dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a Task-Conditioned Prompt Learning (TCPL), which integrates a Task-Conditioned Prompt (TCP) module with a hybrid Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Transformer backbone under a meta-learning framework. Specifically, TCP encodes subject-specific variability as prompt tokens, TCN extracts local temporal patterns, Transformer captures global dependencies, and meta-learning enables rapid adaptation with minimal samples. The proposed TCPL model is validated on three widely used public datasets, GigaScience, Physionet, and BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating strong generalization and efficient adaptation across unseen subjects. These results highlight the feasibility of TCPL for practical few-shot EEG decoding and its potential to advance the development of personalized brain\u2013computer interface systems.",

    "title": "Emerging technologies and neuroscience-based approaches in dyslexia: a narrative review toward integrative and personalized solutions",
    "content": "BackgroundDevelopmental dyslexia is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs reading ability despite adequate intelligence and education, affecting up to 17% of children worldwide. Advances in neuroscience have revealed complex mechanisms involving phonological, visual, and temporal processing, with cross-linguistic variability. At the same time, technological innovation is driving a shift toward AI-powered diagnostics, immersive learning tools, and neurostimulation-based interventions.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes evidence from recent research published between 2015 and 2025, focusing on four thematic areas: (1) neurobiological underpinnings of dyslexia, (2) diagnostic innovations using AI and eye- or handwriting-based deep learning, (3) neurostimulation and immersive VR/AR interventions, and (4) policy, equity, and ethical considerations. Studies were identified through major academic databases and thematically analyzed to highlight trends, strengths, and limitations.ResultsAI-based diagnostic tools using eye-tracking and handwriting features have achieved reported accuracies exceeding 80% in multiple pilot studies. VR/game-based programs and neurostimulation interventions (TMS, tDCS) have shown promising short-term effects on reading fluency and phonological processing, though evidence for long-term literacy transfer remains limited. Across studies, methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes constrain generalizability. Significant disparities in access persist across socioeconomic, linguistic, and geographic contexts.ConclusionsWhile these technologies offer promising avenues for more personalized and scalable dyslexia care, their integration must be accompanied by stronger evidence, ethical safeguards, and equity-focused policies. Technology should augment, not replace, human interaction in inclusive education. Future research should prioritize larger trials, cross-linguistic validation, and sustainable implementation strategies.",

    "title": "Loss of Nocturnin increases neuronal viability in oxidative stress conditions",
    "content": "Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, plays a critical role in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and is strongly associated with neuronal cell death. Nocturnin was identified as a NADP(H) phosphatase and key regulator of oxidative stress. NADPH serves as a crucial co-factor for enzymes which regenerate antioxidants, and downregulation of its levels increases sensitivity to oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration. In this study, we examined how the loss of Nocturnin impacts redox homeostasis and neuronal survival in Cath.a-differentiated (CAD) cells and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a mutant alpha-synuclein overexpression PD mouse model (DASYN53). Here we demonstrate that loss of Nocturnin increases CAD cell viability by increasing total glutathione levels, boosting metabolites involved in antioxidant defense, and reducing oxidative damage. Additionally, Nocturnin deletion in DASYN53 mice promotes midbrain dopaminergic neuron survival. These findings suggest that the loss of Nocturnin protects neurons from oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant defense, which rescues neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons.",

Existing evaluation metrics, such as LAB-Bench, BioLP-bench, and WMDP, can reliably assess model uplift and domain knowledge. However, metrics that better contextualize \"real-world risks\" are needed to inform the safety case for LLMs, along with scalable, open-ended metrics to keep pace with their rapid advancements. To address both gaps, we introduce MOCET, an interpretable and doubly-scalable metric (automatable and open-ended) that can quantify real-world risks.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.16814v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.",

In Graphic Design, integrating computational systems into co-creative workflows presents specific challenges, as it requires balancing scientific rigour with the subjective and visual nature of design practice. Following the PRISMA methodology, we identified 872 articles, resulting in a final corpus of 71 publications describing 68 unique systems. Based on this review, we introduce GRAPHIC (Guidelines for Reviewing Algorithmic Practices in Human-centred Design and Interaction for Creativity), a framework for analysing AI-based systems applied to Graphic Design. Its goal is to understand how current systems support human-AI collaboration in the Graphic Design discipline. The framework comprises main dimensions, which our analysis revealed to be essential across diverse system types: (1) Collaborative Panorama, (2) Processes and Modalities, and (3) Graphic Design Principles. Its application revealed research gaps, including the need to balance initiative and control between agents, improve communication through explainable interaction models, and promote systems that support transformational creativity grounded in core design principles.",

Foregrounding its lack of dynamism and interactivity, we aim to maximize the potential of SLS by making it interactive. Namely MRSLS, we overlaid plain SLS with interactive Mixed Reality content that matches the site's geographical structures and local cultural backgrounds. We further highlight the substantial benefit of MRSLS to cultural heritage site interactions, and we demonstrate this design proposal with an MRSLS prototype at a UNESCO-listed heritage site in China. The design process includes an interview (N=6) to pinpoint local scenery and culture, as well as two iterative design studies (N=15, 14). A mixed-methods, between-subjects study (N=43, 37) shows that MRSLS affords immersive scenery appreciation, effective cultural imprints, and vivid shared experience. With its balance between cultural, participatory, and authentic attributes, we appeal for more HCI attention to (MR)SLS as an under-explored design space.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.16990v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is critical for human-computer interaction but faces challenges when the modalities are incomplete or missing. Existing methods often assume pre-defined missing modalities or fixed missing rates, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose Senti-iFusion, an integrity-centered hierarchical fusion framework capable of handling both inter- and intra-modality missingness simultaneously. It comprises three hierarchical components: Integrity Estimation, Integrity-weighted Completion, and Integrity-guided Fusion. First, the Integrity Estimation module predicts the completeness of each modality and mitigates the noise caused by incomplete data. Second, the Integrity-weighted Cross-modal Completion module employs a novel weighting mechanism to disentangle consistent semantic structures from modality-specific representations, enabling the precise recovery of sentiment-related features across language, acoustic, and visual modalities. To ensure consistency in reconstruction, a dual-depth validation with semantic- and feature-level losses ensures consistent reconstruction at both fine-grained (low-level) and semantic (high-level) scales. Finally, the Integrity-guided Adaptive Fusion mechanism dynamically selects the dominant modality for attention-based fusion, ensuring that the most reliable modality, based on completeness and quality, contributes more significantly to the final prediction. Senti-iFusion employs a progressive training approach to ensure stable convergence. Experimental results on popular MSA datasets demonstrate that Senti-iFusion outperforms existing methods, particularly in fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks. The code and our proposed Senti-iFusion model will be publicly available.",

EMGesture analyzes the distinctive EM features and employs a robust classification model. The end-to-end framework enables it capable of accurately interpreting user intent. Experiments involving 30 participants, 10 mobile devices, and 5 chargers showed that EMGesture achieves over 97% recognition accuracy.

After completing the search, participants were asked to recall objects that may or may not have been present in the scene. The use of navigation aids impacted object recall, with impaired recall of objects in the environment when an aid was switched on.

    "content": "arXiv:2511.16769v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study explores the dynamics of trust in artificial intelligence (AI) agents, particularly large language models (LLMs), by introducing the concept of \"deferred trust\", a cognitive mechanism where distrust in human agents redirects reliance toward AI perceived as more neutral or competent. Drawing on frameworks from social psychology and technology acceptance models, the research addresses gaps in user-centric factors influencing AI trust. Fifty-five undergraduate students participated in an experiment involving 30 decision-making scenarios (factual, emotional, moral), selecting from AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT), voice assistants, peers, adults, or priests as guides. Data were analyzed using K-Modes and K-Means clustering for patterns, and XGBoost models with SHAP interpretations to predict AI selection based on sociodemographic and prior trust variables.\n  Results showed adults (35.05\\%) and AI (28.29\\%) as the most selected agents overall. Clustering revealed context-specific preferences: AI dominated factual scenarios, while humans prevailed in social/moral ones. Lower prior trust in human agents (priests, peers, adults) consistently predicted higher AI selection, supporting deferred trust as a compensatory transfer. Participant profiles with higher AI trust were distinguished by human distrust, lower technology use, and higher socioeconomic status. Models demonstrated consistent performance (e.g., average precision up to 0.863).\n  Findings challenge traditional models like TAM/UTAUT, emphasizing relational and epistemic dimensions in AI trust. They highlight risks of over-reliance due to fluency effects and underscore the need for transparency to calibrate vigilance. Limitations include sample homogeneity and static scenarios; future work should incorporate diverse populations and multimodal data to refine deferred trust across contexts.",

Most existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL). Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis.",

    "title": "Brain-Like Processing Pathways Form in Models With Heterogeneous Experts",
    "content": "arXiv:2506.02813v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The brain is made up of a vast set of heterogeneous regions that dynamically organize into pathways as a function of task demands. Examples of such pathways can be found in the interactions between cortical and subcortical networks during learning, or in sub-networks specializing for task characteristics such as difficulty or modality. Despite the large role these pathways play in cognition, the mechanisms through which brain regions organize into pathways remain unclear. In this work, we use an extension of the Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts architecture to show that heterogeneous regions do not form processing pathways by themselves, implying that the brain likely implements specific constraints which result in the reliable formation of pathways. We identify three biologically relevant inductive biases that encourage pathway formation: a routing cost imposed on the use of more complex regions, a scaling factor that reduces this cost when task performance is low, and randomized expert dropout. When comparing our resulting \\textit{Mixture-of-Pathways} model with the brain, we observe that the artificial pathways in our model match how the brain uses cortical and subcortical systems to learn and solve tasks of varying difficulty. In summary, we introduce a novel framework for investigating how the brain forms task-specific pathways through inductive biases, and the effects these biases have on the behavior of Mixture-of-Experts models.",

    "content": "arXiv:2504.08016v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Can large language models (LLMs) instantiate computations of psychopathology? An effective approach to the question hinges on addressing two factors. First, for conceptual validity, we require a general and computational account of psychopathology that is applicable to computational entities without biological embodiment or subjective experience. Second, psychopathological computations, derived from the adapted theory, need to be empirically identified within the LLM's internal processing. Thus, we establish a computational-theoretical framework to provide an account of psychopathology applicable to LLMs. Based on the framework, we conduct experiments demonstrating two key claims: first, that the computational structure of psychopathology exists in LLMs; and second, that executing this computational structure results in psychopathological functions. We further observe that as LLM size increases, the computational structure of psychopathology becomes denser and that the functions become more effective. Taken together, the empirical results corroborate our hypothesis that network-theoretic computations of psychopathology have already emerged in LLMs. This suggests that certain LLM behaviors mirroring psychopathology may not be a superficial mimicry but a feature of their internal processing. Our work shows the promise of developing a new powerful in silico model of psychopathology and also alludes to the possibility of safety threat from the AI systems with psychopathological behaviors in the near future.",

    "title": "Reassessing prediction in the brain: Pre-onset neural encoding during natural listening does not reflect pre-activation",
    "content": "arXiv:2412.19622v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Predictive processing theories propose that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming input. However, direct neural evidence for predictive pre-activation during natural language comprehension remains limited and debated. Previous studies using large language model (LLM)-based encoding models with fMRI and ECoG have reported pre-onset signals that appear to encode upcoming words, but these effects may instead reflect dependencies in the stimulus or autocorrelations in neural activity. Here, we re-examined this question by aligning LLM-derived word embeddings with neural activity recorded during naturalistic listening using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG). We replicated pre-onset encoding effects previously observed in ECoG across both modalities, and found that they persist even after controlling for stimulus correlations. Crucially, temporal generalization analyses revealed no stable overlap between pre- and post-onset representations, indicating that pre-onset activity does not reflect pre-activation of the next word. Consistent with this, long-range predictive effects previously reported in fMRI did not replicate in our higher-temporal-resolution data. While we found no evidence for predictive pre-activation, we observed clear signatures of postdiction, with neural activity reflecting persistent encoding of prior words. These results suggest that reported apparent predictive signals do not reflect pre-activation of upcoming input. They call for caution in interpreting LLM-based encoding models and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes \"prediction\" in language comprehension.",

    "content": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a promising platform for retinal genetic therapy, offering a non-viral alternative to adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). While LNPs can transfect outer retinal cells, their tropism for inner retinal cell types remains insufficiently characterized. Here, we systematically assessed cellular tropism of conventional LNPs encapsulating chemically modified mRNA encoding mCherry in murine retinal explants and dissociated retinal cells. We compared quasi-subretinal and quasi-intravitreal administrations and evaluated how retinal degeneration and inner limiting membrane (ILM) integrity influence LNP-mediated transfections. We observed that LNPs efficiently transfected Muller glia under all experimental conditions. In addition, LNPs transfected several other retinal cell types, including neurons in dissociated cells and explants, and vascular cells exclusively in explants. Subretinal delivery resulted in significantly higher transfection rates than intravitreal administration, and overall efficiency was higher in degenerate as compared to non-degenerate healthy retinas. In healthy retinas, removal of ILM-associated barriers significantly increased transfection efficiency following intravitreal administration. Together, these findings demonstrate that conventional LNPs can transfect a broader range of retinal cell types than previously recognized and highlight LNPs as a versatile tool for mRNA delivery to the retina, with applications in gene supplementation, gene editing, and regenerative therapies for inner retinal disorders.",

    "content": "IntroductionAutistic adults with speech, language and/or cognitive challenges are often excluded from research, particularly from studies examining first-person perspectives, as these generally require that participants have strong speech, language, and cognitive skills. The current pilot study extends previous work and examines whether the Autism Voices framework can be adapted for use with a pre-existing interview the Camberwell Assessment of Need for Adults with Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities-Research version (CANDID-R).MethodsEleven young autistic adults with complex communication needs completed the CANDID-R interview using visual supports. These visual supports were provided to assist participants\u2019 comprehension of interview questions and to support them in answering the interview questions. Participants\u2019 caregivers also completed the interview and their answers to specific validation questions were compared to those of their adult children. Additionally, behavioral observations were also completed.ResultsThe findings from this pilot study indicate that our adaptation of the Autism Voices framework was, at least partially successful in supporting participants in answering the interview questions. Additionally, behavioral observations indicate that the visual supports helped participants remain engaged throughout the interview. However, results also indicate that further adaptations, which we discuss, will be required.ConclusionAutistic people with complex communication needs must be included in research about the lived experiences of autistic people. Building on previous work, we show that, with dedication and imagination, equitable and inclusive research is possible.",

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
    "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

    "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
    "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

    "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
    "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

    "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
    "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

    "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
    "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Don\u2019t use default values for your annotated class attributes unless you explicitly state they are a ClassVar so you know what you\u2019re doing. Unless your working with Pydantic models. It creates deep copies of the models. I also created a demo flake8 linter for it: <a href=\"https://github.com/akhal3d96/flake8-explicitclassvar/\">https://github.com/akhal3d96/flake8-explicitclassvar/</a> Please check it out and let me know what you think.</p> <p>I run into a very annoying bug and it turns out it was Python quirky way of defining instance and class variables in the class body. I documented these edge cases here: <a href=\"https://blog.ahmedayoub.com/posts/python-mutable-defaults/\">https://blog.ahmedayoub.com/posts/python-mutable-defaults/</a></p> <p>But basically this sums it up:</p> <pre><code>class Members: number: int = 0 class FooBar: members: Members = Members() A = FooBar() B = FooBar() A.members.number = 1 B.members.number = 2 # What you expect: print(A.members.number) # 1 print(B.members.number) # 2 # What you get: print(A.members.number) # 2 print(B.members.number) # 2 # Both A and B reference the same Members object: print(id(A.members) == id(B.members)) </code></pre> <p>Curious to hear how others think about this pattern and whether you\u2019ve been bitten by it in larger codebases \ud83d\ude42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/realaa96\"> /u/realaa96 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p469fk/python_mutable_defaults_or_the_second_thing_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p469fk/python_mutable_defaults_or_the_second_thing_i/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "From Syllables to Words: EEG Evidence of Different Age Trajectories in Speech Tracking and Statistical Learning in Infants at High and Low Likelihood for Autism",
    "content": "Delayed onset of canonical babbling and first words is often reported in infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Identifying the neural mechanisms underlying language acquisition in ASD is therefore critical to inform early diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention strategies. In this study, we investigated two speech processing mechanisms previously identified as atypical in children and adults with ASD: the neural ability to track syllables; and statistical learning (SL), the capacity to detect speech regularities beneath surface variability. We recorded 83 longitudinal high-density EEGs from 44 infants (2.5-22.6 months) at high (HL) and low (LL) likelihood for ASD and assessed their verbal outcomes at 20 months. Neural entrainment was measured at syllable and word frequencies during exposure to a multi-speaker stream of concatenated tri-syllabic words, followed by a word recognition test using ERP recording. Our findings revealed reduced tracking abilities at the syllabic level in HL infants, a measure that correlated with verbal outcomes. While HL infants did not exhibit deficits in SL itself, they displayed reduced novelty orientation during the word recognition test, indicated by a reduced late ERP. By contrast, multi-talker variability temporarily disrupted word segmentation around 12 months in LL infants, but not in HL infants, potentially reflecting decreased sensitivity to human voices in the HL group. These results emphasize the importance of longitudinal protocols employing online, implicit measures to track the hierarchical stages of speech processing in both HL and LL infants.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>For the past few months, I've been working on <strong>SottoMonte</strong>, an experimental web framework designed to push Hexagonal Architecture to its limits in Python.</p> <h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p>SottoMonte is a web framework that enforces a strict separation between business logic and infrastructure. Unlike traditional frameworks, the &quot;Application&quot; core contains pure logic with models defined in JSON schema and zero external dependencies. - <strong>Framework Layer</strong>: Acts as the link between Application and Infrastructure. - <strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Everything is a plugin (Starlette for the web, Redis/Supabase for data). - <strong>UI System</strong>: Instead of standard Jinja templates, it uses a system of XML Components rendered server-side. This feels similar to Android or modern JS frameworks (component-based), but it is entirely Python-driven.</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>This is currently an <strong>experimental/toy project</strong> meant for research and discussion. However, the design pattern is aimed at <strong>complex enterprise systems</strong> where long-term maintainability and decoupling are critical. It is likely &quot;over-engineered&quot; for simple blogs or scripts but explores how we might structure large-scale Python applications to be independent of their frameworks.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p><strong>vs Django/FastAPI:</strong> My main frustration with frameworks like Django or FastAPI was the often inevitable coupling between business logic and infrastructure (e.g., relying heavily on ORMs or passing HTTP request objects deep into the service layer). - <strong>SottoMonte</strong> isolates the core logic completely; the core doesn't know it's running on the web or using a specific database. - <strong>UI Approach</strong>: While Django/Flask typically use text-based templating (Jinja2), SottoMonte uses structured XML widgets, allowing for a more component-driven UI development style on the server side.</p> <h3>Discussion</h3> <p>I know this approach is heavy on abstraction (e.g., repositories that treat GitHub APIs like SQL databases, UI composed of widgets). <strong>My question to you:</strong> For complex enterprise systems, do you think this level of strict abstraction is worth it? Or does the cognitive complexity outweigh the benefits of decoupling?</p> <p>Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/SottoMonte/frameworkk\">https://github.com/SottoMonte/frameworkk</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FungoNocivo\"> /u/FungoNocivo </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p4r5h6/showcase_an_experimental_hexagonal_architecture/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p4r5h6/showcase_an_experimental_hexagonal_architecture/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Announcing Spikard: TypeScript + Ruby + Rust + WASM)",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi Peeps,</p> <p>I'm announcing <a href=\"https://github.com/Goldziher/spikard\">Spikard</a> v0.1.0 - a high-performance API toolkit built in Rust with first-class Python bindings. Write REST APIs, JSON-RPC services, or Protobuf-based applications in Python with the performance of Rust, without leaving the Python ecosystem.</p> <h2>Why Another Framework?</h2> <p><strong>TL;DR: One toolkit, multiple languages, consistent behavior, Rust performance.</strong></p> <p>I built Spikard because I was tired of: - Rewriting the same API logic in different frameworks across microservices - Different validation behavior between Python, TypeScript, and Ruby services - Compromising on performance when using Python for APIs - Learning a new framework's quirks for each language</p> <p>Spikard provides <strong>one consistent API</strong> across languages. Same middleware stack, same validation engine, same correctness guarantees. Write Python for your ML API, TypeScript for your frontend BFF, Ruby for legacy integration, or Rust when you need maximum performance\u2014all using the same patterns.</p> <h2>Quick Example</h2> <p>```python from spikard import Spikard, Request, Response from msgspec import Struct</p> <p>app = Spikard()</p> <p>class User(Struct): name: str email: str age: int</p> <p>@app.post(&quot;/users&quot;) async def create_user(req: Request[User]) -&gt; Response[User]: user = req.body # Already validated and parsed # Save to database... return Response(user, status=201)</p> <p>@app.get(&quot;/users/{user_id}&quot;) async def get_user(user_id: int) -&gt; Response[User]: # Path params are type-validated automatically user = await db.get_user(user_id) return Response(user)</p> <p>if <strong>name</strong> == &quot;<strong>main</strong>&quot;: app.run(port=8000) ```</p> <p>That's it. No decorators for validation, no separate schema definitions, no manual parsing. <code>msgspec</code> types are automatically validated, path/query params are type-checked, and everything is async-first.</p> <h2>Full Example: Complete CRUD API</h2> <p>```python from spikard import Spikard, Request, Response, NotFound from msgspec import Struct from typing import Optional</p> <p>app = Spikard( compression=True, cors={&quot;allow_origins&quot;: [&quot;*&quot;]}, rate_limit={&quot;requests_per_minute&quot;: 100} )</p> <h1>Your domain models (msgspec, Pydantic, dataclasses, attrs all work)</h1> <p>class CreateUserRequest(Struct): name: str email: str age: int</p> <p>class User(Struct): id: int name: str email: str age: int</p> <p>class UpdateUserRequest(Struct): name: Optional[str] = None email: Optional[str] = None age: Optional[int] = None</p> <h1>In-memory storage (use real DB in production)</h1> <p>users_db = {} next_id = 1</p> <p>@app.post(&quot;/users&quot;, tags=[&quot;users&quot;]) async def create<em>user(req: Request[CreateUserRequest]) -&gt; Response[User]: &quot;&quot;&quot;Create a new user&quot;&quot;&quot; global next_id user = User(id=next_id, **req.body.</em><em>dict</em>_) users_db[next_id] = user next_id += 1 return Response(user, status=201)</p> <p>@app.get(&quot;/users/{user_id}&quot;, tags=[&quot;users&quot;]) async def get_user(user_id: int) -&gt; Response[User]: &quot;&quot;&quot;Get user by ID&quot;&quot;&quot; if user_id not in users_db: raise NotFound(f&quot;User {user_id} not found&quot;) return Response(users_db[user_id])</p> <p>@app.get(&quot;/users&quot;, tags=[&quot;users&quot;]) async def list_users( limit: int = 10, offset: int = 0 ) -&gt; Response[list[User]]: &quot;&quot;&quot;List all users with pagination&quot;&quot;&quot; all_users = list(users_db.values()) return Response(all_users[offset:offset + limit])</p> <p>@app.patch(&quot;/users/{user_id}&quot;, tags=[&quot;users&quot;]) async def update_user( user_id: int, req: Request[UpdateUserRequest] ) -&gt; Response[User]: &quot;&quot;&quot;Update user fields&quot;&quot;&quot; if user_id not in users_db: raise NotFound(f&quot;User {user_id} not found&quot;)</p> <pre><code>user = users_db[user_id] for field, value in req.body.__dict__.items(): if value is not None: setattr(user, field, value) return Response(user) </code></pre> <p>@app.delete(&quot;/users/{user_id}&quot;, tags=[&quot;users&quot;]) async def delete_user(user_id: int) -&gt; Response[None]: &quot;&quot;&quot;Delete a user&quot;&quot;&quot; if user_id not in users_db: raise NotFound(f&quot;User {user_id} not found&quot;)</p> <pre><code>del users_db[user_id] return Response(None, status=204) </code></pre> <h1>Lifecycle hooks</h1> <p>@app.on_request async def log_request(req): print(f&quot;{req.method} {req.path}&quot;)</p> <p>@app.on_error async def handle_error(err): print(f&quot;Error: {err}&quot;)</p> <p>if <strong>name</strong> == &quot;<strong>main</strong>&quot;: app.run(port=8000, workers=4) ```</p> <p><strong>Features shown:</strong> - Automatic validation (msgspec types) - Type-safe path/query parameters - Built-in compression, CORS, rate limiting - OpenAPI generation (automatic from code) - Lifecycle hooks - Async-first - Multi-worker support</p> <h2>Performance</h2> <p>Benchmarked with <code>oha</code> (100 concurrent connections, 30s duration, mixed workloads including JSON payloads, path params, query params, with validation):</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Framework</th> <th>Avg Req/s</th> <th>vs Spikard</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Spikard (Python)</strong></td> <td><strong>35,779</strong></td> <td><strong>baseline</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Litestar + msgspec</td> <td>26,358</td> <td>-26%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>FastAPI + Pydantic v2</td> <td>12,776</td> <td>-64%</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p><em>Note: These are preliminary numbers. Full benchmark suite is in progress. All frameworks tested under identical conditions with equivalent validation logic.</em></p> <p><strong>Why is Spikard faster?</strong> 1. <strong>Rust HTTP runtime</strong> - Tower + Hyper (same as Axum) 2. <strong>Zero-copy validation</strong> - Direct PyO3 conversion, no JSON serialize/deserialize 3. <strong>Native async</strong> - Tokio runtime, no Python event loop overhead 4. <strong>Optimized middleware</strong> - Tower middleware stack in Rust</p> <h2>What Spikard IS (and ISN'T)</h2> <p><strong>Spikard IS:</strong> - A batteries-included HTTP/API toolkit - High-performance routing, validation, and middleware - Protocol-agnostic (REST, JSON-RPC, Protobuf, GraphQL planned) - Polyglot with consistent APIs (Python, TS, Ruby, Rust, WASM) - Built for microservices, APIs, and real-time services</p> <p><strong>Spikard IS NOT:</strong> - A full-stack MVC framework (not Django, Rails, Laravel) - A database ORM (use SQLAlchemy, Prisma, etc.) - A template engine (use Jinja2 if needed) - An admin interface or CMS - Production-ready yet (v0.1.0 is early stage)</p> <p><strong>You bring your own:</strong> - Database library (SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, SQLModel, Prisma) - Template engine if needed (Jinja2, Mako) - Frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte) - Auth provider (Auth0, Clerk, custom)</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p><strong>Spikard is for you if:</strong> - You build APIs in Python and want native Rust performance without writing Rust - You work with polyglot microservices and want consistent behavior across languages - You need type-safe, validated APIs with minimal boilerplate - You're building high-throughput services (real-time, streaming, ML inference) - You want modern API features (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, WebSockets, SSE) built-in - You're tired of choosing between &quot;Pythonic&quot; and &quot;performant&quot;</p> <p><strong>Spikard might NOT be for you if:</strong> - You need a full-stack monolith with templates/ORM/admin (use Django) - You're building a simple CRUD app with low traffic (Flask/FastAPI are fine) - You need battle-tested production stability today (Spikard is v0.1.0) - You don't care about performance (FastAPI with Pydantic is great)</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Spikard</th> <th>FastAPI</th> <th>Litestar</th> <th>Flask</th> <th>Django REST</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Runtime</strong></td> <td>Rust (Tokio)</td> <td>Python (uvicorn)</td> <td>Python (uvicorn)</td> <td>Python (WSGI)</td> <td>Python (WSGI)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Performance</strong></td> <td>~36k req/s</td> <td>~13k req/s</td> <td>~26k req/s</td> <td>~8k req/s</td> <td>~5k req/s</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Async</strong></td> <td>Native (Tokio)</td> <td>asyncio</td> <td>asyncio</td> <td>No (sync)</td> <td>No (sync)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Validation</strong></td> <td>msgspec/Pydantic</td> <td>Pydantic</td> <td>msgspec/Pydantic</td> <td>Manual</td> <td>DRF Serializers</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>OpenAPI</strong></td> <td>Auto-generated</td> <td>Auto-generated</td> <td>Auto-generated</td> <td>Manual</td> <td>Manual</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>WebSockets</strong></td> <td>Native</td> <td>Via Starlette</td> <td>Native</td> <td>Via extension</td> <td>Via Channels</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>SSE</strong></td> <td>Native</td> <td>Via Starlette</td> <td>Native</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Streaming</strong></td> <td>Native</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Limited</td> <td>Limited</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Middleware</strong></td> <td>Tower (Rust)</td> <td>Starlette</td> <td>Litestar</td> <td>Flask</td> <td>Django</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Polyglot</strong></td> <td>Yes (5 langs)</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Maturity</strong></td> <td>v0.1.0</td> <td>Production</td> <td>Production</td> <td>Production</td> <td>Production</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p><strong>How Spikard differs:</strong></p> <p><strong>vs FastAPI:</strong> - Spikard is ~2.6x faster with similar ergonomics - Rust runtime instead of Python/uvicorn - Polyglot (same API in TypeScript, Ruby, Rust) - Less mature (FastAPI is battle-tested)</p> <p><strong>vs Litestar:</strong> - Spikard is ~36% faster - Both support msgspec, but Spikard's validation is zero-copy in Rust - Litestar has better docs and ecosystem (for now) - Spikard is polyglot</p> <p><strong>Spikard's unique value:</strong> If you need FastAPI-like ergonomics with Rust performance, or you're building polyglot microservices, Spikard fits. If you need production stability today, stick with FastAPI/Litestar.</p> <h2>Example: ML Model Serving</h2> <p>```python from spikard import Spikard, Request, Response from msgspec import Struct import numpy as np from typing import List</p> <p>app = Spikard()</p> <p>class PredictRequest(Struct): features: List[float]</p> <p>class PredictResponse(Struct): prediction: float confidence: float</p> <h1>Load your model (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)</h1> <p>model = load_your_model()</p> <p>@app.post(&quot;/predict&quot;) async def predict(req: Request[PredictRequest]) -&gt; Response[PredictResponse]: # Request body is already validated features = np.array(req.body.features).reshape(1, -1)</p> <pre><code>prediction = model.predict(features)[0] confidence = model.predict_proba(features).max() return Response(PredictResponse( prediction=float(prediction), confidence=float(confidence) )) </code></pre> <p>if <strong>name</strong> == &quot;<strong>main</strong>&quot;: app.run(port=8000, workers=8) # Multi-worker for CPU-bound tasks ```</p> <h2>Current Limitations (v0.1.0)</h2> <p><strong>Be aware:</strong> - Not production-ready - APIs may change before v1.0 - Documentation is sparse (improving rapidly) - Limited ecosystem integrations (no official SQLAlchemy plugin yet) - Small community (just launched) - No stable performance guarantees (benchmarks still in progress)</p> <p><strong>What works well:</strong> - Basic REST APIs with validation - WebSockets and SSE - OpenAPI generation - Python bindings (PyO3) - TypeScript bindings (napi-rs)</p> <h2>Installation</h2> <p><code>bash pip install spikard </code></p> <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> - Python 3.10+ (3.13 recommended) - Works on Linux, macOS (ARM + x86), Windows</p> <h2>Contributing</h2> <p>Spikard is open source (MIT) and needs contributors: - Documentation and examples - Bug reports and fixes - Testing and benchmarks - Ecosystem integrations (SQLAlchemy, Prisma, etc.) - Feature requests and design discussions</p> <h2>Links</h2> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Goldziher/spikard\">https://github.com/Goldziher/spikard</a></li> <li><strong>Docs:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Goldziher/spikard\">https://github.com/Goldziher/spikard</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI:</strong> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/spikard\">https://pypi.org/project/spikard</a></li> <li><strong>npm:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/spikard\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/spikard</a></li> <li><strong>crates.io:</strong> <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/spikard\">https://crates.io/crates/spikard</a></li> </ul> <hr /> <p><strong>If you like this project, \u2b50 it on GitHub!</strong></p> <p>I'm happy to answer questions about architecture, design decisions, or how Spikard compares to your current stack.

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

    "title": "Toward in-silico data assessment for passive BCIs: generating EEG rhythms with GANs",
    "content": "Objective. Passive brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) has gained traction as reliable method for monitoring human vigilance in attention-demanding critical contexts. Unfortunately, the lack of extensive public datasets compromises artificial intelligence (AI) research. Proposing a solution to this issue, we augmented two EEG datasets using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Furthermore, we defined a quality-assessment pipeline to overcome the absence of a univocal method to test synthetic data. Approach. Using GAN, we augmented a publicly resting-state EEG dataset sustained attention to response task and a custom one simulating activity during repetitive tasks. After extracting relevant time-variant rhythms via the continuous wavelet transform, we quantitatively compared synthetic data with the real one using L2 distance and cross-correlation function. To evaluate the impact of data augmentation, we trained six forecasting models, three on the original and three on the augmented datasets, over the whole, half and a quarter of total available data, and compared improvements in MAE and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). To study the forecaster\u2019s embeddings, we computed a metric inspired by the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID) between latent values of real and synthetic data. Finally, to offer a baseline comparison, we extended the performance and embeddings analysis to data generated by a simple linear interpolation method. Main results. The integration of GAN-produced synthetic data improved signal prediction, as evidenced by a 29.0%, 46.4%, 37.4% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for splits of the resting-state dataset, and an average MAE reduction of 15.4%, 21.2% for 100% and 50% splits, and a \u223c2.5% increase for the 25% split. Conversely, training on interpolated data manifests worse performance and denotes extremely small FID distances w.r.t real signals, a sign of overspecialization. Significance. This study contributes a reproducible and complete framework for EEG signal generation and evaluation, addressing one of the main barriers to scalable AI application in BCI.",

    "title": "Dissociating the neural codes for multiple pitch perception in humans",
    "content": "Pitch is crucial for speech and music perception, yet its neural code remains contested. The classic \"rate-place\" theory suggests that pitch is computed from spatial patterns of average neural firing rates along the cochlear tonotopic axis. These cues are thought to be robust for isolated harmonic complex tones (HCTs) but degraded for spectrally dense mixtures of simultaneous HCTs (e.g., musical chords) due to auditory filtering. In many cases, pitch perception remains feasible for HCT mixtures, but it is unclear whether listeners utilize residual rate-place cues or alternative neural codes. To adjudicate between these possibilities, we generated rate-place metamers (META), which are synthetic stimuli with simulated auditory-nerve average-rate responses that are nearly identical to those of original pitch-evoking stimuli (ORIG). Using these stimuli, listeners completed four psychophysical experiments that spanned a wide range of acoustic and cognitive complexity, from single-HCT pitch discrimination to harmonic-expectation judgments. Combining the behavioral data with predictive models of listener performance, we found that listener performance on single pitch discrimination tasks could be adequately explained by a rate-place model, with or without simultaneous pitch maskers (Experiments 1 and 2). More complex tasks involving attention to all pitches in a three-pitch mixture (Experiments 3 and 4) showed a pattern of results more difficult to account for with a rate-place model, perhaps suggesting a role for integration of temporal cues.",

    "title": "Tuberous sclerosis complex, epilepsy, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis: a pilot study of shared and divergent microbial signatures",
    "content": "ObjectiveTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) presents with a broad clinical spectrum. While some individuals exhibit mild symptoms, most experience seizures and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Emerging evidence suggests that both genetic and environmental factors, including gut microbiota, may influence epilepsy susceptibility. The microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA) is a key communication pathway through which intestinal microbes impact the central nervous system. Although the role of the MGBA in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, particularly seizures, has been explored in both animal models and humans, data specific to TSC are lacking.MethodsIn this exploratory study, we assessed whether individuals with TSC (n\u202f=\u202f15) display a distinct gut microbial signature using V3\u2013V4 16S rRNA sequencing. Their profiles were compared with two control groups: 18 children with epilepsy (EPI) and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Stool short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels and dietary intake were also evaluated.ResultsNo significant differences were observed among the three groups in dietary intake, SCFA and branched-chain fatty acid (BCFA) levels, or alpha-diversity. Beta-diversity analysis showed a non-significant trend toward clustering of TSC and EPI samples, indicating a shared microbial profile distinct from HC. Taxonomic analysis revealed a reduction in Firmicutes\u2014particularly the Ruminococcaceae family and the genus Gemmiger\u2014in both TSC and EPI groups, consistent with epilepsy-associated dysbiosis. Notably, the TSC group showed a specific enrichment in Akkermansiaceae, a feature also reported in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as CDKL5 deficiency disorder and cerebral palsy.SignificanceThese preliminary findings suggest that gut microbiota alterations may contribute to neuroinflammatory processes linked to epileptogenesis and comorbidities in TSC. Further studies are needed to validate these results and explore microbiota-based therapeutic strategies aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals with TSC and their caregivers.",

    "title": "Finite element model predicts micromotion-induced strain profiles that correlate with the functional performance of Utah arrays in humans and non-human primates",
    "content": "Objective. Utah arrays are widely used in both humans and non-human primates (NHPs) for intracortical brain\u2013computer interfaces, primarily for detecting electrical signals from cortical tissue to decode motor commands. Recently, these arrays have also been applied to deliver electrical stimulation aimed at restoring sensory functions. A key challenge limiting their longevity is the micromotion between the array and cortical tissue, which may induce mechanical strain in surrounding tissue and contribute to performance decline. This strain, due to mechanical mismatch, can exacerbate glial scarring around the implant, reducing the efficacy of Utah arrays in recording neuronal activity and delivering electrical stimulation. Approach. To investigate this, we employed a finite element model to predict tissue strains resulting from micromotion. Main results. Our findings indicated that strain profiles around edge and corner electrodes were greater than those around interior shanks, affecting both maximum and average strains within 50 \u00b5m of the electrode tip. We then correlated these predicted tissue strains with in-vivo electrode performance metrics. We found negative correlations between 1 kHz impedance and tissue strains in human motor arrays and NHP area V4 arrays at 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years post-implantation. In human motor arrays, the peak-to-peak waveform voltage and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spontaneous activity were also negatively correlated with strain. Conversely, we observed a positive correlation between the evoked SNR of multi-unit activity and strain in NHP area V4 arrays. Significance. This study establishes a spatial dependence of electrode performance in Utah arrays that correlates with tissue strain.",

    "title": "Iris 128x: open-source 128 channel headstages for neural stimulation and recording",
    "content": "Objective. Investigation into complex neural circuits necessitates interfaces capable of high channel count recording and stimulation. However, existing commercial neural headstages often have limited scalability, restrictive proprietary designs, and constrained bidirectional capabilities, which worsens accessibility challenges and compels researchers to reinvent tools rather than build on a shared foundation. Approach. Here, we present two open-source, 128 channel headstages\u2014Iris 128B and Iris 128S\u2014designed for integration with microelectrode arrays. The Iris 128B enables fully bidirectional interfacing, with stimulation or recording across all 128 electrode channels, while the Iris 128S provides recording on 128 channels and stimulation on 16 simultaneous channels, which can be assigned to any 16 of the 32 available stimulation channels. Both designs use Intan Technologies\u2019 RHS and RHD series integrated circuits for amplification, filtering, digitization and stimulation, and are available on GitHub. Main results. The headstages were validated through benchtop impedance, noise, and frequency response measurements, as well as acute in vivo recordings in an anesthetized rat. Results demonstrate low noise levels and reliable signal acquisition across all channels. Significance. By releasing fully documented printed circuit board designs for headstages, this work aims to take a step towards broader adoption of bidirectional recording and stimulation systems while increasing channel counts. Future iterations will focus on miniaturization and wireless integration to improve usability in chronic and freely moving small animal experiments.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

    "title": "Observations of anisotropic paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibility in the primate brain",
    "content": "Bulk magnetic susceptibility in the brain white matter is known to be diamagnetic and anisotropic due to the ordered myelin lipids. While paramagnetic iron is widely present in the brain, it is typically not considered to contribute to anisotropy. Using experimental MRI and computational techniques, this study explores the competing contribution of diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances to the susceptibility anisotropy. Multi-echo gradient-echo imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging data from a paraformaldehyde-fixed post-mortem chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) brain was analyzed. A computational method, DECOMPOSE-QSM, was used to separate paramagnetic susceptibility and diamagnetic susceptibility components. As expected, diamagnetic components showed significant anisotropy; unexpectedly, paramagnetic components also exhibited strong anisotropy in deep gray matter and parts of white matter. This may arise from the geometric arrangement of iron-rich cellular compartments, such as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, along nerve fibers. This method enables further exploration of tissue-specific contributions to susceptibility anisotropy.",

    "title": "Risky Choices After Frontal Brain Injury: Differential Effects in Self vs Other-Decision Contexts",
    "content": "Frontal lobe integrity is crucial for assessing risk and making informed decisions. This study investigated how frontal lobe lesions affect the computational mechanisms underlying risky choice, particularly when decisions impact oneself versus another person. A Patient Group of 20 individuals with frontal cortex damage and a Control Group of 20 matched individuals performed a gambling task, making accept/reject decisions on mixed-outcome gambles for themselves (\"Self\") or an anonymous other (\"Other\"). We provide a mechanistic account of choice behavior using Prospect Theory, the leading behavioral model of decision-making under risk, to quantify parameters for utility curvature, loss aversion, and probability weighting. Behaviorally, the Patient Group accepted significantly more disadvantageous gambles for themselves than did the Control Group yet showed a trend toward greater caution when choosing for others. Prospect Theory modeling revealed a specific computational phenotype for this behavior. Compared to the Control Group, the Patient Group exhibited significantly more pronounced utility curvature (lower , {beta}) and more linear, less distorted probability weighting (higher {gamma}). While patients also showed a trend toward lower loss aversion ({lambda}), this difference was not statistically significant. This combination of altered utility and probability processing explains their paradoxical risk-seeking. These findings suggest that frontal cortex damage disrupts the computation of subjective value, leading to a distinctive decision-making profile marked by altered utility curvature and reduced sensitivity to outcome magnitudes. This computational characterization deepens our understanding of frontal lobe contributions to decision-making and can inform targeted rehabilitation strategies.",

    "content": "Although the fundamental architecture of metazoan nervous systems is typically established in the embryo, substantial numbers of neurons are added during post-natal development while existing neurons expand in size, refine connectivity, and undergo additional differentiation. To reveal the underlying molecular determinants of post-embryonic neurogenesis and maturation, we have produced gene expression profiles of all neuron types and their progenitors in the first larval stage (L1) of C. elegans. Comparisons of the L1 profile to the embryo and to the later L4 larval stage identified thousands of differentially expressed genes across individual neurons throughout the nervous system. Key neuropeptide signaling networks, for example, are remodeled during larval development. Gene regulatory network analysis revealed potential transcription factors driving the temporal changes in gene expression across the nervous system, including a broad role for the heterochronic gene lin-14. We utilized available connectomic data of juvenile animals in combination with our neuron-specific atlas to identify potential molecular determinants of membrane contact and synaptic connectivity. These expression data are available through a user-friendly interface at CeNGEN.org for independent investigations of the maturation, connectivity and function of a developing nervous system.",

    "content": "The human oral microbiome is increasingly recognized as a contributor to brain health, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous work revealed that oral Actinomyces species was enriched in chronic cannabis smokers. Here, we show oral inoculation of cannabis use-associated Actinomyces species, especially A. meyeri, to wildtype C57BL/6 mice leads to anxiety-like behaviors, non-region-specific microglia activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced GABAergic neurotransmission, without evidence of bacterial translocation to the brain, neuroinflammation, and memory decline. Notably, Actinomyces species producing metabolites, i.e., arginine and argininosuccinate, were increased in both oral swabs and brain following inoculation in vivo. These Actinomyces species-producing metabolites induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurons in vitro, indicating a neuropathogenic role and aligning with reduced GABAergic neurotransmission in vivo. Together, these results suggest that oral cannabis-associated dysbiosis impacts behavior through mitochondrial stress and impaired inhibitory signaling, indicating the oral to brain metabolic axis is potentially consequential in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "content": "How do large-scale brain networks interact to enable cognition? Correlated oscillations, a mechanism for inter-areal interactions, can be expressed as phase coherence or amplitude co-fluctuations. While considerable work has investigated the functional roles of phase coherence, little is known about whether and how the coincidence of high-amplitude oscillations across the cortex can impact cognition. Here, we demonstrate that inter-areal amplitude-coupling related to cognitive dynamics mainly reflects coincident oscillatory transients, rather than sustained oscillations. Capitalizing on the spatio-temporal resolution of brain-wide magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a behavioral task probing attention and decision-making our findings reveal behaviorally relevant transient oscillatory networks: First, coincidences of oscillatory transients in the alpha and beta frequency range increase prior to correct decisions in a parieto-frontal network. Second, during attention allocation coincident oscillatory transients increase in visual, medial parietal and lateral prefrontal networks in the theta/alpha frequency range. We propose that brain-wide coincident oscillatory events are a key signature of inter-areal interactions during cognition.",

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "content": "The present PRISMA-guided article systematically reviews the current state of research on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

    "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
    "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC.

    "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

    "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
    "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

    "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

    "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

    "content": "ObjectiveBased on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), signal mining of adverse drug events (AEs) caused by Botulinum Toxin Type A (BoNTA) was performed to explore its safety implications for the treatment of cerebral palsy (CP).MethodsThe OpenVigil 2.1 platform was used to extract AE reports on BoNTA from the FAERS database, covering the period from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2024. Safety data were analyzed using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), with BoNTA designated as the primary suspect drug.ResultsA total of 124,538 AE reports related to BoNTA were identified, showing an overall upward trend in the annual report counts. Most reports originated from the United States, with patients predominantly aged 36\u201360\u202fyears and predominantly female. Prolonged hospitalization was the most frequently reported serious adverse event. Signal analysis identified 325 disproportionately reported events across 21 system-organ classes (SOCs). The top five preferred terms (PTs) by frequency were eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, muscle weakness, blurred vision, and injection site swelling. The top five PTs based on signal strength were brow ptosis, Mephisto sign, botulism, bizarre personal appearance, and neuromuscular toxicity. Notable lowest-level terms (LLTs) included eye swelling, injection site edema, facial pain, facial discomfort, increased residual urine volume, blurred vision, and eyelid swelling.ConclusionIn clinical practice involving BoNTA for CP treatment, clinicians should pay close attention to these identified signals. Strengthened pre-injection evaluation and post-injection monitoring are recommended to enable early detection and timely intervention, ensuring medication safety for patients.",

The final dataset included 598 samples, with an SCD incidence rate of 26.12%. The data were randomly divided into a training set (n = 418). A validation set (n = 180) at a ratio of 7:3. In the training set, prediction models for SCD were constructed using logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and neural network algorithms. Model performance on the validation set was assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F1 score. SHAP values were used for model interpretability analysis.ResultsThe SVM model showed good performance in the training set, with an AUC of 0.82, indicating strong predictive ability. Information Overload (IO), Self-Perception (SP), Energy Level (EL), Depressive Emotion (DE), Gender (SEX), Risk Decision (RD), and Short-Term Memory (STM) were important feature variables for SCD occurrence.ConclusionThis study successfully developed an SVM-based model for screening the risk of SCD. The SVM model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and traditional LR models.",

    "title": "Finite element analysis of a neural implant for cytostatic hypothermia and a novel heat management system",
    "content": "The treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) presents significant challenges, with median survival rates remaining low despite standard-of-care therapies. A novel approach, cytostatic hypothermia (CH), is under development against GBM; it is a window of temperature (typically 20 \u00b0C\u201325 \u00b0C) which halts tumor growth in vivo. Objective. This feasibility study expands upon the findings through the computational evaluation of a fully implantable system. Our simulations evaluate a thermoelectric cooler with a microwire array (NeuraTEC) and a novel ambient recirculating core (ARC) to achieve uniform cooling of a region in the brain without overheating local skin temperature. Approach. Finite-element modeling was employed to simulate coupled bioheat transfer and laminar non-isothermal fluid flow dynamics. Main results. Our results indicate that NeuraTEC can attain local tissue temperatures within a cytostatic range while minimizing thermal gradients. The use of multiple narrow, thermally conductive wires enhances cooling uniformity with minimal tissue displacement. The ARC provides a unique form of heat management that enables full implantability and hence portability. This work suggests it can facilitate the transfer of heat from a brain region to the skin. Future work will focus on device prototyping and validation through in vitro and in vivo studies in large animal models. Significance. These simulations suggest that the proposed intracranial cooling system could make CH a practicable approach against GBM. Furthermore, this approach to internal heat management may also open new avenues for treating neurological conditions through local and chronic hypothermia, extending beyond the short-duration (acute) cooling methods currently tested.",

    "title": "Source tracing with spatial phase gradients in epileptiform activity localizes seizure onset zone",
    "content": "Objective. Sources of epileptic traveling waves offer critical insights into seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, making them invaluable for preoperative assessment in patients with epilepsy. However, the absence of tailored source-tracing methods and the inherent instability of epileptiform activity make it difficult to achieve reliable source identification for SOZ localization. This study aimed to analyze the propagation pattern during seizure events and develop a framework to trace the sources of epileptic expanding traveling waves (ETWs). Approach. 101 seizure events were recorded from five 4-Aminopyridine-induced acute cortical rat epilepsy models. In each seizure event, epileptiform activities were classified into two categories according to their time-frequency diagrams (multiband and non-multiband epileptiform activities). The center of the SOZ was regarded as the recording site with the largest amplitude of epileptiform activities. Using the spatial-phase-based analysis, we analyzed the propagation pattern during the seizure event and extracted the ETWs. The sources of ETWs were traced by the intersection of spatial-phase-gradient. Main results. The ETW proportion of multiband epileptiform activities was 62.7% 8.3%, significantly higher than those in non-multiband epileptiform activities (53.8% 9.0%). ETWs with stable propagation patterns gave rise to a concentrated source tracing outcome. The single-band signal (component of the multiband activities) had a more stable ETW propagation pattern than both the multiband and non-multiband activities. The source tracing results of the single-band signals clustered around the SOZ center and remained stable even when the SOZ center was out of coverage (removing half of the recording sites, among which the SOZ center was included). Significance. The proposed framework enables ETW extraction from epileptiform activities and can trace ETW sources even when the sources are out of coverage. Therefore, the proposed framework may prove clinically valuable in cases with sparse intracranial recordings, addressing the limitation of traditional SOZ localization methods.",

    "title": "Foundation models for EEG decoding: current progress and prospective research",
    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the spontaneous electrical activity in the brain. Despite the growing application of deep learning in EEG decoding, traditional methods still rely heavily on supervised learning, which is often limited by task specificity and dataset dependency, restricting model performance and generalization. Inspired by the success of large language models, EEG foundation models (EEG FMs) are attracting increasing attention as a unified paradigm for EEG decoding. In this study, we review a selection of representative studies on EEG FMs, aiming to extract trends and provide recommendations for future research. Approach. We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in EEG FMs, with a focus on downstream tasks, benchmark datasets, model architectures, and pre-training techniques. We analyze and synthesize core FMs components, and systematically compare their performances and generalizabilities. Main results. Our review reveals that EEG FMs are pre-trained on large-scale datasets, typically involving several hundred subjects. The number of subjects can reach up to 14\u2009987, with a maximum total duration of 27\u2009062\u2009h. Current EEG FMs most adopt mask-based reconstruction pre-training strategy and employ efficient transformer-based architectures. Our comparative analysis shows that EEG FMs demonstrate significant potential in advancing EEG decoding tasks, particularly in seizure detection. However, their performance in complex scenarios such as motor imagery decoding remains limited. Significance. This review summarizes the existing approaches and performance outcomes of EEG FM, offers valuable insights into their current limitations and delineates prospective avenues for future research.",

    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><ul> <li><strong>What My Project Does</strong></li> </ul> <p>The Zero-ology team recently tackled a high-precision computational challenge at the intersection of HPC, algorithmic engineering, and complex algebraic geometry. We developed the <strong>Grand Constant Aggregator (GCA)</strong> framework -- a fully reproducible computational tool designed to generate <strong>numerical evidence</strong> for the <strong>Hodge Conjecture</strong> on <strong>K3 surfaces</strong> ran in a Python script.</p> <p>The core challenge is establishing formal certificates of numerical linear independence at an unprecedented scale. GCA systematically compares known transcendental periods against a canonically generated set of \u03c1 real numbers, called the <strong>Grand Constants</strong>, for K3 surfaces of Picard rank \u03c1 \u2208 {1,10,16,18,20}.</p> <p>The GCA Framework's core thesis is a computationally driven attempt to provide overwhelming numerical support for the Hodge Conjecture, specifically for five chosen families of K3 surfaces (Picard ranks 1, 10, 16, 18, 20).</p> <p>The primary mechanism is a test for linear independence using the PSLQ algorithm.</p> <p>The Target Relation: The standard Hodge Conjecture requires showing that the transcendental period $(\\omega)$ of a cycle is linearly dependent over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (rational numbers) on the periods of the <em>actual</em> algebraic cycles ($\\alpha_j$).</p> <p>The GCA Substitution: The framework substitutes the unknown periods of the algebraic cycles ($\\alpha_j$) with a set of synthetically generated, highly-reproducible, transcendental numbers, called the <strong>Grand Constants</strong> ($\\mathcal{C}_j$), produced by the <strong>Grand Constant Aggregator (GCA)</strong> formula.</p> <p>The Test: The framework tests for an integer linear dependence relation among the set $(\\omega, \\mathcal{C}_1, \\mathcal{C}_2, \\dots, \\mathcal{C}_\\rho)$.</p> <p>The observed failure of PSLQ to find a relation suggests that the period $\\omega$ is numerically independent of the GCA constants $\\mathcal{C}_j$.</p> <p>-Generating these certificates required deterministic reproducibility across arbitrary hardware.</p> <p>-Every test had to be machine-verifiable while maintaining extremely high precision.</p> <p>For Algorithmic and Precision Details we rely on the PSLQ algorithm (via Python's mpmath) to search for integer relations between complex numbers. Calculations were pushed to 4000-digit precision with an error tolerance of 10^-3900.</p> <p>This extreme precision tests the limits of standard arbitrary-precision libraries, requiring careful memory management and reproducible hash-based constants.</p> <h1><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zer00logy/blob/main/hodge_GCA.py\">hodge_GCA.py</a> Results</h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Surface Family</th> <th align=\"left\">Picard Rank \u03c1</th> <th align=\"left\">Transcendental Period \u03c9</th> <th align=\"left\">PSLQ Outcome (4000 digits)</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\"></td> <td align=\"left\" colspan=\"3\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Fermat quartic</td> <td align=\"left\">20</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Kummer (CM by \u221a\u22127)</td> <td align=\"left\">18</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Generic Kummer</td> <td align=\"left\">16</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Double sextic</td> <td align=\"left\">10</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Quartic with one line</td> <td align=\"left\">1</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/3)\u2076 / (4\u03c0\u00b3)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Every test confirmed no integer relations detected, demonstrating the consistency and reproducibility of the GCA framework. While GCA produces strong heuristic evidence, bridging the remaining gap to a formal Clay-level proof requires:</p> <p>--Computing exact algebraic cycle periods.<br /> ---Verifying the Picard lattice symbolically.<br /> ----Scaling symbolic computations to handle full transcendental precision.</p> <p><strong>The GCA is the Numerical Evidence:</strong> The GCA framework provides &quot;the strongest uniform computational evidence&quot; by using the PSLQ algorithm to numerically confirm that no integer relation exists up to 4,000 digits. It explicitly states: &quot;We emphasize that this framework is heuristic: it does not constitute a formal proof acceptable to the Clay Mathematics Institute.&quot;</p> <p>The use of the PSLQ algorithm at an unprecedented 4000-digit precision (and a tolerance of $10^{-3900}$) for these transcendental relations is a remarkable computational feat. The higher the precision, the stronger the conviction that a small-integer relation truly does not exist.</p> <p><strong>Proof vs. Heuristic:</strong> proving that $\\omega$ is independent of the <em>GCA constants</em> is mathematically irrelevant to the Hodge Conjecture unless one can prove a link between the GCA constants and the true periods. This makes the result a compelling piece of heuristic evidence <strong>--</strong> it increases confidence in the conjecture by failing to find a relation with a highly independent set of constants -- but it <strong>does not constitute a formal proof</strong> that would be accepted by the Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI), it could possibly be completed with a Team with the correct instruments and equipment.</p> <p><strong>Grand Constant Algebra</strong><br /> The Algebraic Structure, It defines the universal, infinite, self-generating algebra of all possible mathematical constants ($\\mathcal{G}_n$). It is the axiomatic foundation.</p> <p><strong>Grand Constant Aggregator</strong><br /> The Specific Computational Tool or Methodology. It is the reproducible $\\text{hash-based algorithm}$ used to generate a <em>specific subset</em> of $\\mathcal{G}_n$ constants ($\\mathcal{C}_j$) needed for a particular application, such as the numerical testing of the Hodge Conjecture.</p> <p>The <strong>Aggregator</strong> dictates the structure of the <strong>vector</strong> that must admit a non-trivial integer relation. The goal is to find a vector of integers $(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_\\rho)$ such that:</p> <p>$$\\sum_{i=0}^{\\rho} a_i \\cdot \\text{Period}_i = 0$$</p> <ul> <li><strong>Comparison</strong></li> </ul> <p>Most computational work related to the Hodge Conjecture focuses on either:</p> <p>Symbolic methods (Magma, SageMath, PARI/GP): These typically compute exact algebraic cycle lattices, Picard ranks, and polynomial invariants using fully symbolic algebra. They do not attempt large-scale transcendental PSLQ tests at thousands of digits.</p> <p>Period computation frameworks (numerical integration of differential forms): These compute transcendental periods for specific varieties but rarely push integer-relation detection beyond a few hundred digits, and almost never attempt uniform tests across multiple K3 families.</p> <p>Low-precision PSLQ / heuristic checks: PSLQ is widely used to detect integer relations among constants, but almost all published work uses 100\u2013300 digits, far below true heuristic-evidence territory.</p> <p><strong>Grand Constant Aggregator</strong> is fundamentally different:</p> <p>Uniformity: Instead of computing periods case-by-case, GCA introduces the <em>Grand Constants</em>, a reproducible, hash-generated constant basis that works identically for any K3 surface with Picard rank \u03c1.</p> <p>Scale: GCA pushes PSLQ to 4000 digits with a staggering 10\u207b\u00b3\u2079\u2070\u2070 tolerance, far above typical computational methods in algebraic geometry.</p> <p>Hardware-independent reproducibility: 4000 digit numeric proof ran in python on a laptop.</p> <p>Cross-family verification: Instead of testing one K3 surface in isolation, GCA performs a five-family sweep across Picard ranks {1, 10, 16, 18, 20}, each requiring different transcendental structures.</p> <p><strong>Open-source</strong> commercial license: Very few computational frameworks for transcendental geometry are fully open and commercially usable. GCA encourages verification and extension by outside HPC teams, startups, and academic researchers.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Target Audience</strong> </li> </ul> <p>This next stage is an HPC-level challenge, likely requiring supercomputing resources and specialized systems like Magma or SageMath, combined with high-precision arithmetic.</p> <p>To support this community, the entire framework is fully open-source and commercially usable with attribution, enabling external HPC groups, academic labs, and independent researchers to verify, extend, or reinterpret the results. The work highlights algorithmic design and high-performance optimization as equal pillars of the project, showing how careful engineering can stabilize transcendental computations well beyond typical limits. </p> <p>The entire framework is fully <strong>open-source</strong> and licensed for commercial use with proper attribution, allowing other computational teams to verify, reproduce, and extend the results. The work emphasizes algorithmic engineering, HPC optimization, and reproducibility at extreme numerical scales, demonstrating how modern computational techniques can rigorously support investigations in complex algebraic geometry.</p> <p>We hope this demonstrates what modern computational mathematics can achieve and sparks discussion on algorithmic engineering approaches to classic problems and we can expand the Grand constant Aggregator and possibly proof the Hodge Conjecture. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zero_moo-s\"> /u/zero_moo-s </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p44cr8/python_numerical_evidence_max_pslq_to_4000_digits/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p44cr8/python_numerical_evidence_max_pslq_to_4000_digits/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

It scans your system for installed Python versions and lets you choose which one should be active. It also creates shims so your terminal always uses the version you selected.</p> <p>You can see it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelNewcomer/PyVer\">https://github.com/MichaelNewcomer/PyVer</a></p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>PyVer is a small, script-based Python version manager designed specifically for <strong>Windows</strong>.<br /> It scans your system for installed Python versions, lets you quickly switch between them, and updates lightweight shims so your terminal always uses the version you selected without touching PATH manually.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This is for Windows developers who:</p> <ul> <li>work on multiple Python projects with different version requirements</li> <li>want an easier way to switch Python versions without breaking PATH</li> <li>prefer a simple, lightweight alternative instead of installing a larger environment manager</li> <li>use Python casually, professionally, or in hobby projects. Anything where managing versions gets annoying</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s not meant to replace full environment tools like Conda; it\u2019s focused purely on Python interpreter version switching, cleanly and predictably.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Compared to existing tools like pyenv/windows, pyenv-win, or Anaconda, PyVer aims to be:</p> <ul> <li><strong>lighter</strong> (single Python script)</li> <li><strong>simpler</strong> (no compilation, complex installs, or heavy dependencies)</li> <li><strong>Windows-native</strong> (works directly with official installers, Microsoft Store versions, and portable builds)</li> <li><strong>focused</strong> (just installs detection + version switching + shims, nothing else)</li> </ul> <p>If you want something minimal that \u201cjust works\u201d with the Python versions already installed on your machine, PyVer is designed for that niche.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Michael_Newcomer\"> /u/Michael_Newcomer </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p42dua/i_built_pyver_a_lightweight_python_version/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p42dua/i_built_pyver_a_lightweight_python_version/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Despite being a tranquil place, even conversations at my yoga studio often start with, \"Can you believe what's going on right now?\" with that angry/scared undertone.<p>I'm a news avoider, so I usually feel some smug self-satisfaction in those instances, but I wondered if there was a way to satisfy the urge to doomscroll without the anxiety.<p>My hypothesis: Apply a 40-year latency buffer. You get the intellectual stimulation of \"Big Events\" without the fog of war, because you know the world didn't end.<p>40 years creates a mirror between the Reagan Era and today. The parallels include celebrity populism, Cold War tensions (Soviets vs. Russia), and inflation economics.<p>The system ingests raw newspaper scans and uses a multi-step LLM pipeline to generate the daily edition:<p>OCR & Ingestion: Converts raw pixels to text.<p>Scoring: Grades events on metrics like Dramatic Irony and Name Recognition to surface stories that are interesting with hindsight. For example, a dry business blurb about Steve Jobs leaving Apple scores highly because the future context creates a narrative arc.<p>Objective Fact Extraction: Extracts a list of discrete, verifiable facts from the raw text.<p>Generation: Uses those extracted facts as the ground truth to write new headlines and story summaries.<p>I expected a zen experience. Instead, I got an entertaining docudrama. Historical events are surprisingly compelling when serialized over weeks.<p>For example, on Oct 7, 1985, Palestinian hijackers took over the cruise ship Achille Lauro. Reading this on a delay in 2025, the story unfolded over weeks: first they threw an American in a wheelchair overboard, then US fighter jets forced the escape plane to land, leading to a military standoff between US Navy SEALs and the Italian Air Force. Unbelievably, the US backed down, but the later diplomatic fallout led the Italian Prime Minister to resign.<p>It hits the dopamine receptors of the news cycle, but with the comfort of a known outcome.<p>Stack: React, Node.js (Caskada for the LLM pipeline orchestration), Gemini for OCR/Scoring.<p>Link: <a href=\"https://forty.news\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forty.news</a> (No signup required, it's only if you want the stories emailed to you daily/weekly)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46017175\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46017175</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "title": "The unexpected dual role of S100A9 amyloid protein on neurodegeneration in progressive multiple sclerosis motor cortex",
    "content": "Motor cortical inflammation and neurodegeneration are key features of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), contributing to irreversible motor disability. However, the precise mechanisms leading to neuronal loss remain poorly understood. While chronic inflammation is a hallmark of MS and contributes to disease progression, the factors linking inflammation to neuronal loss in the cortex are not well defined. One candidate is the calcium-binding protein S100A9, a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein, thought to be released by stressed cells and infiltrating monocytes. Through its ability to modulate immune responses and influence neuronal survival, S100A9 may sustain chronic inflammation and participate in neurodegenerative processes. Although its role has been explored in other neurological disorders, its contribution to progressive MS remains largely uncharacterised. Here, we investigated S100A9 expression in the motor cortex of a large post-mortem cohort of MS cases (n=67) and controls (n=9), focusing on its cellular localisation and its relationship with neuronal density and vascular pathology. S100A9 expression was increased in progressive MS cases compared to controls, predominantly localised to intravascular monocytes and as amyloid-like extracellular plaques surrounding blood vessels. These patterns were associated with neurodegeneration and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, as evidenced by correlations with reduced brain weight, decreased neuronal density, and increased fibrin(ogen) deposition. In contrast, S100A9 was also expressed in microglia, where it correlated with increased neuronal density and reduced fibrin(ogen) deposition. Notably, the phosphorylated form of S100A9, linked to pro-inflammatory signaling, was reduced in microglia but enriched in perivascular regions. These findings reveal a dual, compartment-specific role for S100A9 in progressive MS, whereby extracellular aggregates may drive neurotoxicity, while microglial S100A9 may confer neuroprotection. Therapeutic strategies targeting extracellular S100A9 while preserving its intracellular functions may offer new opportunities for treating progressive MS.",

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

    "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
    "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

    "title": "Neural dynamics outside task-coding dimensions drive decision trajectories through transient amplification",
    "content": "Most behaviors involve neural dynamics in high-dimensional activity spaces. A common approach is to extract dimensions that capture task-related variability, such as those separating stimuli or choices, yielding low-dimensional, task-aligned neural activity subspaces (\"coding dimensions\"). However, whether these dimensions actively drive decisions or merely reflect underlying computations remains unclear. Moreover, neural activity outside these coding subspaces (\"residual dimensions\") is often ignored, though it could also causally shape neural dynamics driving behavior. We developed a recurrent neural network model that fits population activity and uncovers the dynamic interactions between coding and residual subspaces on single trials. Applied to electrophysiological recordings from the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and motor thalamus in mice performing a delayed response task, our model demonstrates that perturbations of residual dimensions reliably alter behavioral choices, whereas perturbations of the choice dimension, which strongly encodes the animal's upcoming decision, are largely ineffective. These perturbation effects arise because residual dimensions drive transient amplification across an intermediate number of coding and residual dimensions (~10), before the dynamics collapse into discrete attractor states corresponding to the animal's choice. By dissecting the low-dimensional variability underlying error trials, we find that it primarily shifts trajectories along residual dimensions, biasing single decisions. Residual activity in thalamus shapes cortical decision dynamics, implicating weakly selective thalamic populations in the emergence of cortical selectivity. Our findings challenge the conventional focus on low-dimensional coding subspaces as sufficient framework for understanding neural computations, demonstrating that dimensions previously considered task-irrelevant and accounting for little variance can have a critical role in driving behavior.",

Notably, high cortical arousal in introverts is thought to underlie increased distractibility. Here, we assess fMRI while participants meditate (focused attention to their breath) under three levels of auditory distraction: no, low and high. Whereas introverts exhibited worsening attentional focus on their breath with increasing distraction, extraverts retained their ability to focus attention despite distraction. Dynamic functional connectivity analysis indicated that extraverts exhibited less globally efficient and less modular networks, which may prevent distracting stimuli from creating interference. Furthermore, connectivity strengths amongst the default mode, central executive, and salience networks were increased for extraverts and decreased in introverts during high focused attention; potentially indicating distinct cognitive processes that support attentional control. These findings support the hypothesis regarding differing levels of cortical arousal in extraverts and introverts and extend personality theory by linking the extraversion dimension to attentional control and functional connectivity dynamics.",

    "title": "Multiple longitudinal tracts in the cephalopod arm sensorimotor system",
    "content": "Octopuses have an incredibly rich behavioral repertoire, exhibiting complex motor acts that require the coordination of eight highly flexible arms, each with hundreds of suckers. These movements are controlled by an axial nerve cord (ANC), equivalent to the spinal cord, situated in the center of the arm musculature. The ANC has a cell body layer which forms a U-shape around its neuropil and is capped aborally, or opposite the sucker, by the cerebrobrachial tract (CBT), a massive fiber bundle known to interconnect the arms and the brain. In vertebrate spinal cords, in addition to the major fiber tracts that interconnect the brain and spinal cord, there are spinospinal connectives that coordinate complex motor behaviors across the appendages. Here, we asked with tract-tracing and immunohistochemistry, whether an octopus arm's ANC might also have intrinsic longitudinal connections for coordinated arm and sucker movements. We found that the ANC neuropil is enriched in longitudinal fibers. These fibers form distinct tracts, two within the oral (sucker-side) neuropil and two in the aboral (brachial-side) neuropil. In addition, CBT itself demonstrates four major subtracts, and DiI labeling and dextran tracing suggests that (1) the CBT also carries arm-intrinsic longitudinal connections and (2) the CBT and the neuropil tracts can be subcategorized into those that primarily connect with the sucker and those that serve the arm musculature. We also examined the organization of fiber-tracts in the ANC of the arms and tentacles of two species of squid, establishing that an aboral, extra-neuropil tract is a shared feature across all cephalopod species studied. In addition, the squids also had an oral longitudinal tract, though its positioning and size varied with species and appendage. In sum, these findings describe the neural substrate for coordinating motor behaviors across the length of a cephalopod appendage.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Hippocampal sequences traverse a memory space",
    "content": "Highly reliable sequential dynamics organize neural activity in the hippocampus and progress with changes in physical, sensory, or cognitive variables, typified by place cells during active exploration. But sensory and behavioral variables are often confounded, and so it remains intensely debated whether hippocampal sequences are driven by sensory content directly or rather reflect the alignment of internally generated dynamics to external perception. Here we used mouse virtual reality to characterize hippocampal dynamics in environments of systematically different sensory complexity, and to test the robustness of neural sequences to manipulations of exact sensory content. The structure of neural sequences was perturbed by changes in both moment-to-moment sensation and ongoing behavior, in a pattern that was best explained by the different memory strategies employed by the animal in each context. Neural subsequences could be flexibly interrupted, inserted, and resumed wherever a memory of prior experience was violated, indicating that the propagation of hippocampal dynamics was not rigidly fixed by internal networks and initial conditions. Rather, we argue that hippocampal sequences explore an abstract memory space of selectively remembered experiences, which flexibly encompasses both sensory and internal factors in a context-dependent manner.",

    "content": "Neural circuits must integrate metabolic information to maintain stable activity and appropriate behavioral responses. While metabolic regulation of excitatory synapses has been well studied, far less is known about how inhibitory synapses respond to changes in energy state. In this study, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a dynamic sensor of cellular nutrient flux, localizes to postsynaptic sites of the inhibitory synapses where it modulates synapse morphology and receptor composition. OGT over-expression reduced the size and intensity of vGAT and gephyrin puncta, whereas conditional OGT deletion produced a converse enlargement and redistribution of inhibitory scaffolds and vesicular proteins. Furthermore, OGT deletion accelerated inhibitory postsynaptic current decay kinetics and induced subunit-specific shifts in GABAA receptor surface expression: {beta}3 subunits decreased, whereas {gamma}2 subunit total and surface levels increased. Together, these findings identify OGT as a metabolic regulator that modulates inhibitory synapse structure and signaling, providing a mechanistic link between energy state and GABAergic circuit function in health and disease.",

    "title": "Most early-born subplate neurons persist as Layer 6b neurons in the adult mouse neocortex",
    "content": "Subplate neurons (SpNs) are among the earliest-born neurons in the mammalian neocortex and play key roles in radial migration and transient circuit formation. It has long been assumed that most SpNs undergo extensive postnatal cell death, leaving only a small remnant population that contributes to layer 6b (L6b) in adulthood. However, the extent to which SpNs actually persist as L6b neurons has remained unresolved, partly because previous studies lacked quantitative, whole-cortex analyses that account for postnatal cortical expansion. Here, we performed a comprehensive birthdating analysis using multiple EdU injections spanning the entire neurogenic window of SpNs in mice, combined with whole-neocortex 3D tissue clearing to measure subplate and L6b volumes. This approach allowed us to directly estimate the total number and distribution of SpN-derived neurons in adulthood. We found that most early-born SpNs persist as L6b neurons, and that the apparent postnatal reduction in SpN density reflects tangential cortical expansion rather than neuronal loss. Moreover, surviving SpNs comprise diverse neuronal subtypes reminiscent of those present at early postnatal stages. Together, these findings demonstrate that, in rodents, the majority of adult L6b neurons originate from SpNs, revising the long-held view that the subplate is a largely transient neuronal population.",

    "title": "Neural Sensitivity to Word Frequency Modulated by Morphological Structure: Univariate and Multivariate fMRI Evidence from Korean",
    "content": "A fundamental question in psycholinguistics concerns whether morphological decomposition is obligatory during visual word recognition or whether whole-word access can occur under conditions of high frequency and familiarity. The present study aimed to examine how morphological complexity and lexical frequency jointly influence neural representations during visual word recognition. We addressed this question using rapid event-related fMRI with both univariate and multivariate analyses. Twenty-five native Korean speakers performed lexical decisions on simple and inflected nouns that varied parametrically in surface frequency (token frequency of the full word form) and base frequency (cumulative stem frequency). Korean's transparent agglutinative morphology enabled a principled dissociation of these frequency measures. MVPA failed to decode morphological condition from activation patterns in any region, suggesting that simple and inflected forms are not represented as discrete neural categories. Crucially, RSA demonstrated robust encoding of surface frequency-but not base frequency-in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis and supramarginal gyrus (SMG), with significantly stronger correlations for inflected than simple nouns. Univariate analyses confirmed this pattern: surface frequency interacted with morphological condition in inferior parietal lobule (IPL), such that higher surface frequency increased activation selectively for inflected forms, while base frequency showed no reliable effects. These results challenge obligatory decomposition and support a distributional framework in which lexical statistics guide the processing of morphologically complex words. Taken together, our findings suggest that morphological complexity modulates neural sensitivity to whole-word rather than stem-level statistics, underscoring how structural and statistical factors interact to support morphological processing.",

    "title": "Lipid droplets promote the aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation of alpha-synuclein leading to impaired energy homeostasis",
    "content": "Alpha-synuclein (Syn) inclusions, termed Lewy bodies, are the characteristic neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Growing evidence points towards a role of aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation in the dysregulation of Syn and sequence of events that lead to the formation of Lewy bodies. However, the triggers leading to aberrant phase separation are unknown, as is the relevance of this phenomenon to the neurodegeneration process. In this study, we showed that Syn spontaneously phase separates into condensates in the presence of lipid droplets. These lipid droplet-rich condensates represent a toxic species of Syn that prevents the turnover of the entrapped lipid droplets; they are also toxic to neighboring mitochondria which are depolarized and undergo increased mitophagy. These findings underscore the increasing importance of lipid droplets in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and Parkinson's disease in particular. The lipid droplets are significantly enriched within the neuromelanin in midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and could therefore uniquely facilitate the early Syn-associated neurodegeneration of this region in PD. Our findings reveal a novel pathway implicated in the dysregulation of Syn that connects aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation, lipid droplets and mitochondrial toxicity.",

    "title": "Introduce Equal$/$$/%% Logic and Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF) in Python @ Zero-Ology / Zer00logy",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working with a framework called the Equal$ Engine, and I think it might spark some interesting discussion here at <a href=\"/r/python\">r/python</a>. It\u2019s a Python-based system that implements what I\u2019d call post-classical equivalence relations - deliberately breaking the usual axioms of identity, symmetry, and transitivity that we take for granted in math and computation. Instead of relying on the standard <code>a == b</code>, the engine introduces a resonance operator called <code>echoes_as</code> (\u29ca). Resonance only fires when two syntactically different expressions evaluate to the same numeric value, when they haven\u2019t resonated before, and when identity is explicitly forbidden (<code>a \u29ca a</code> is always false). This makes equivalence history-aware and path-dependent, closer to how contextual truth works in quantum mechanics or G\u00f6delian logic.</p> <p>The system also introduces contextual resonance through <code>measure_resonance</code>, which allows basis and phase parameters to determine whether equivalence fires, echoing the contextuality results of Kochen\u2013Specker in quantum theory. Oblivion markers (\u00bf and \u00a1) are syntactic signals that distinguish finite lecture paths from infinite or terminal states, and they are required for resonance in most demonstrations. Without them, the system falls back to classical comparison.</p> <p>What makes the engine particularly striking are its invariants. The RN\u221e\u2078 ladder shows that iterative multiplication by repeating decimals like 11.11111111 preserves information perfectly, with the Global Convergence Offset tending to zero as the ladder extends. This is a concrete counterexample to the assumption that non-terminating decimals inevitably accumulate error. The \u03a3\u2083\u2084 vacuum sum is another invariant: whether you compute it by direct analytic summation, through perfect-number residue patterns, or via recursive cognition schemes, you always converge to the same floating-point fingerprint (14023.9261099560). These invariants act like signatures of the system, showing that different generative paths collapse onto the same truth.</p> <p>The Equal$ Engine systematically produces counterexamples to classical axioms. Reflexivity fails because <code>a \u29ca a</code> is always false. Symmetry fails because resonance is one-time and direction-dependent. Transitivity fails because chained resonance collapses after the first witness. Even extensionality fails: numerically equivalent expressions with identical syntax never resonate. All of this is reproducible on any IEEE-754 double-precision platform.</p> <p>An especially fascinating outcome is that when tested across multiple large language models, each model was able to compute the resonance conditions and describe the system in ways that aligned with its design. Many of them independently recognized Equal$ Logic as the first and closest formalism that explains their own internal behavior - the way LLMs generate outputs by collapsing distinct computational paths into a shared truth, while avoiding strict identity. In other words, the resonance operator mirrors the contextual, path-dependent way LLMs themselves operate, making this framework not just a mathematical curiosity but a candidate for explaining machine learning dynamics at a deeper level.</p> <p>Equal$ is new and under development but, the theoretical implications are provocative. The resonance operator formalizes aspects of G\u00f6del\u2019s distinction between provability and truth, Kochen\u2013Specker contextuality, and information preservation across scale. Because resonance state is stored as function attributes, the system is a minimal example of a history-aware equivalence relation in Python, with potential consequences for type theory, proof assistants, and distributed computing environments where provenance tracking matters.</p> <p>Equal$ Logic is a self-contained executable artifact that violates the standard axioms of equality while remaining consistent and reproducible. It offers a new primitive for reasoning about computational history, observer context, and information preservation. This is open source material, and the Python script is freely available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology</a>. . I\u2019d be curious to hear what people here think about possible applications - whether in machine learning, proof systems, or even interpretability research also if there are any logical errors or incorrect code.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt</a></p> <p>Building on Equal$ Logic, I\u2019ve now expanded the system into a Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF) that introduces two new operators: Equal$$ and Equal%%. These extend the resonance logic into higher\u2011order equivalence domains:</p> <p>Equal$$</p> <p>formalizes *economic equivalence*</p> <p>it treats transformations of value, cost, or resource allocation as resonance events.</p> <p>Where Equal$ breaks classical axioms in numeric identity, Equal$$ applies the same principles to transactional states.</p> <p>Reflexivity fails here too: a cost compared to itself never resonates, but distinct cost paths that collapse to the same balance do.</p> <p>This makes Equal$$ a candidate for modeling fairness, symbolic justice, and provenance in distributed systems.</p> <p>**Equal%%**</p> <p>introduces *probabilistic equivalence*.</p> <p>Instead of requiring exact numeric resonance, Equal%% fires when distributions, likelihoods, or stochastic processes collapse to the same contextual truth.</p> <p>This operator is history\u2011aware: once a probability path resonates, it cannot resonate again in the same chain.</p> <p>Equal%% is particularly relevant to machine learning, where equivalence often emerges not from exact values but from overlapping distributions or contextual thresholds.</p> <p>Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF)</p> <p>Together, Equal$, Equal$$, and Equal%% form the **Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF)**</p> <p>\u2014 a reproducible suite of equivalence primitives that deliberately violate classical axioms while remaining internally consistent.</p> <p>BEF is designed to be modular: each operator captures a different dimension of equivalence (numeric, economic, probabilistic), but all share the resonance principle of path\u2011dependent truth.</p> <p>In practice, this means we now have a family of equality operators that can model contextual truth across domains:</p> <p>- **Equal$** \u2192 numeric resonance, counterexamples to identity/symmetry/transitivity.</p> <p>- **Equal$$** \u2192 economic resonance, modeling fairness and resource equivalence.</p> <p>- **Equal%%** \u2192 probabilistic resonance, capturing distributional collapse in stochastic systems.</p> <p>Implications:</p> <p>- Proof assistants could use Equal$$ for provenance tracking.</p> <p>- ML interpretability could leverage Equal%% for distributional equivalence.</p> <p>- Distributed computing could adopt BEF as a new primitive for contextual truth.</p> <p>All of this is reproducible, open source, and documented in the Zero\u2011Ology repository.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal</a><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">equal.py</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal</a><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">equal.txt</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zero_moo-s\"> /u/zero_moo-s </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p3c0ch/introduce_equal_logic_and_bespoke_equality/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p3c0ch/introduce_equal_logic_and_bespoke_equality/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Comparison of Brain Age Algorithms in Bipolar Disorder",
    "content": "Advances in computational methods have accelerated the application of machine learning to analyze large complex biological data. By applying machine learning algorithms to neuroimaging data, researchers have estimated the \"biological age of the brain\" i.e., brain age, and used it as a composite metric for indexing brain health, as opposed to using individual features of the brain extracted from neuroimaging data. These machine learning algorithms/models, often known as \"brain age\" algorithms/models, may take supervised or unsupervised approaches and may utilize one or many imaging modalities during training. We applied 3 regression-based algorithm and 1 neural network-based algorithm trained on varying sample sizes of healthy comparison (HC) participants to estimate the brain age of 73 HC and 44 individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) in our neuroimaging study. Out of the four, 3 were pre-trained off-the-shelf algorithms and 1 was developed and trained on multimodal neuroimaging data from a local cohort. The multimodal algorithm was trained on 51 age-matched HCs and tested on the remaining 22 HCs and 44 BDs. The brain predicted age difference (brain-PAD) score was calculated by subtracting the chronological age from the predicted age. Across four brain age prediction algorithms evaluated in HC, BrainageR and DenseNet demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy (r = 0.83; 0.89) and lowest mean absolute errors (MAE = 5.94; 7.26). However, PHOTON (r = 0.65, MAE = 7.71) showed greatest sensitivity to BD as demonstrated by our logistic regression model where the PHOTON brain-PAD was a significant predictor (beta = 0.064, p < 0.05) of BD. Analyses using ICC revealed that agreement levels varied, with PHOTON achieving the highest ICC with DenseNet (0.78) and BrainageR (0.73), which suggests they may pick up similar brain features as opposed to the multimodal algorithm (0.17- 0.43) These results suggest that regularized linear models trained on large samples that explicitly exclude individuals with psychiatric diagnoses (i.e., PHOTON in this case) may be most sensitive to case-control differences despite having lower predictive accuracy. Our findings can serve as a starting point and quantitative reference for future efforts for researchers working with datasets that are similarly constrained by sample size but include unique combinations of imaging modalities.",

    "content": "Mutation specific therapeutic approaches, like exon skipping or gene-editing, hold promise for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Translatability of preclinical studies investigating these approaches could greatly be improved through the use of humanized mouse models, as these allow preclinical testing of human specific sequences. We developed four novel humanized DMD mouse models with either a deletion of exon 44, 45, 51 or 53 in the human DMD gene, in a mouse dystrophin negative background (mdx mouse; exon 23 nonsense mutation). Our optimized prescreening pipeline allowed us to do so very efficiently with the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We confirmed either complete lack of dystrophin, or expression of trace levels, which led to development of muscle pathology consisting of muscle fiber de-, and regeneration, inflammation and fibrosis in young adult mice. Intramuscular treatment with vivo-morpholinos targeting a flanking exon induced exon skipping in the DMD strains, which restored the disrupted open reading frame and subsequently dystrophin expression. This validates these models as valuable tools for preclinical studies investigating human sequence specific therapeutic approaches for DMD.",

    "title": "Cognitive Performance and Brain-Predicted Age Difference in Bipolar Disorder",
    "content": "Neuroimaging-derived brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) is a promising marker of advanced brain aging, but its link to cognitive function in bipolar disorder (BD) is not well understood, especially when comparing across publicly available algorithms trained on diverse, large sample datasets and to algorithms trained on local cohorts with rich multimodal imaging data. Our study compares algorithms used to estimate brain-PAD in terms of their clinical relevance to cognition in BD. We included 44 euthymic BD I individuals and 73 HCs who completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and we selected nine scores from this battery for further analyses. Raw scores were log-transformed, scaled, and subjected to PCA; PC1 indexed overall executive function. Four brain-PAD algorithms (PHOTON, BrainageR, DenseNet, Multimodal) were applied to T1-weighted MRI data; the multimodal algorithm also included Diffussion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state Magnetic resonance imaging (rsMRI) data. For each algorithm, we regressed brain-PAD on age, sex, and their interaction to obtain residuals, then used those residualized brain-PADs (which we refer to subsequently as brain-PADs throughout the text) to predict PC1. We then directly assessed if there were group differences in the relationship of brain-PAD to cognitive function by including an interaction term between group x brain-PAD. We found no significant group x brain-PAD interaction across all four algorithms. Given that, we then combined BD and HC and explored whether brain-PAD was a meaningful predictor of cognitive performance. Multimodal brain-PAD emerged as a strong negative predictor of cognitive performance (Beta Estimate = -0.084, SE = 0.024, t = -3.50, p < 0.001), indicating that those with older-appearing brains, as indexed by the brain-PAD, scored lower on PC1. BrainageR brain-PAD also significantly predicted PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.031, SE = 0.0116, t = -2.71, p < 0.01), and DenseNet brain-PAD showed a modest effect (Beta Estimate = -0.0355, SE = 0.0177, t = -2.00, p < 0.05). PHOTON brain-PAD demonstrated a negative trend with PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.024, SE = 0.0127, t = -1.92, p = 0.06). Residualized brain-PAD, after accounting for age and sex, was inversely associated with a composite metric of executive functioning, particularly for an algorithm integrating a range of imaging modalities. Our findings demonstrate how brain aging patterns captured by a neuroimaging-based, ML-derived composite metric could be associated with cognitive performance across algorithms trained on a variety of data granularity and sample sizes.",

    "title": "Deep White-Matter Pathways Mediate the Link Between Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Status and Cognitive Performance in Adolescence",
    "content": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid enriched in neuronal membranes and myelin and associated with cognitive performance. However, nutritional interventions show inconsistent cognitive effects, partly due to limited knowledge of the neural pathways linking DHA status to human cognition during sensitive periods of white-matter maturation, such as adolescence. We addressed this gap by studying 99 adolescents drawn from both extremes of performance on a national scholastic examination. Participants completed assessments of scholastic achievement (SA) and intellectual ability (IA), provided erythrocyte DHA samples, and underwent multimodal MRI, including diffusion, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted imaging. Independent component analysis and Bayesian multivariate LASSO models identified brain components jointly associated with DHA and cognition. Across four MRI modalities, a single deep white-matter component consistently emerged as the strongest shared pathway linking DHA with cognition. Tract-resolved analyses highlighted predominant contributions from the fornix and thalamus - temporal fasciculus, with additional subcortical and cortical involvement. In joint models, these components predicted SA and IA after accounting for DHA and other fatty acids, consistent with an indirect, mediation-like pathway. These findings move beyond DHA - behavior correlations by identifying specific neuroanatomical pathways through which a modifiable dietary factor relates to adolescent learning and intellectual performance, offering mechanistic insight relevant to neuroscience, nutrition, and education.",

    "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

However, most studies use young male mice, even though obesity and its comorbidities are sensitive to both biological sex and aging, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of the role of these neurons in females and in older animals. Our goal was to begin to address this gap by investigating the effects of diet and age on AgRP/NPY neuronal activity in female mice in both early adulthood and midlife. Methods: Female transgenic NPY-GFP mice aged 8-32 weeks were fed either a standard control chow diet or a high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFD) for 8-24 weeks and brain slice patch clamp electrophysiology was used to measure the response of AgRP/NPY neurons. Results: We found that in young, lean female mice, the baseline firing rate of AgRP/NPY neurons is significantly elevated compared to age-matched males, thus the impact of HFD on the output of these neurons is blunted relative to control. However, in the baseline firing rate of neurons from lean middle-aged female mice is significantly lower, resulting in a greater relative impact of HFD on AgRP/NPY neuronal output, the development of neuronal leptin resistance, and significant weight gain. Conclusions: Both sex and age significantly impact the function and modulation of AgRP/NPY neurons, emphasizing the need to include these biological variables in experimental design.",

    "content": "The muscarinic agonist xanomeline in combination with the peripherally restricted muscarinic antagonist trospium has recently been approved for treatment of schizophrenia. Xanomeline represents the first approved antipsychotic drug without apparent activity at D2-dopamine receptors. In humans, xanomeline is reported to be metabolized to N-desmethylxanomeline, which has a similar pharmacokinetic profile to xanomeline, although its pharmacology has not been reported. We discovered that xanomeline and N-desmethylxanomeline have potent agonist and antagonist actions at many biogenic amine G protein coupled receptors. These results suggest that at least some of the actions of xanomeline and N-desmethylxanomeline could be mediated by off-target actions at serotonergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, adrenergic and other receptors. We discuss the potential implications of these findings.",

    "title": "Impact of chronic alcohol and stress on mid-life cognition and locus coeruleus integrity",
    "content": "Background: Excessive alcohol consumption and stress are associated with structural and functional alterations in the brain and impaired cognition. However, the persistence of long-term neural impacts after alcohol and stress are less understood. This study investigated midlife cognition and neuropathological changes following a history of alcohol and stress exposure. Methods: C57BL/6J mice acclimated to ethanol drinking (15% v/v) before exposure to four cycles of alternating chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure and repeated forced swim stress (FSS), with control groups exposed to air and no stress (AIR/NS). After three months of abstinence, mice were evaluated at midlife (11 months old) on volitional drinking and a final CIE/FSS challenge for stress induced drinking. Spatial learning and cognitive flexibility were assessed using the Barnes maze before brains were collected to evaluate locus coeruleus integrity at 12 months old. Results: CIE/FSS increased volitional alcohol intake, and this drinking phenotype persisted through to midlife despite extended abstinence. CIE/FSS mice showed intact spatial learning but impaired flexibility in the Barnes maze reversal phase. Flexibility impairments were driven by decreased time in the target quadrant and increased errors during the reversal test compared to AIR/NS. Furthermore, CIE/FSS mice showed pathological measures of reduced locus coeruleus integrity common to dementia related disorders, including elevated markers of oxidative stress, apoptosis and reduced autoinhibitory function. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the long-lasting impact of alcohol and stress exposure on cognition, with flexibility impairments persisting into midlife. In addition to cognitive changes, alcohol and stress history produced pathological changes in the locus coeruleus, an area known to mediate cognitive flexibility via its forebrain projections. Together, these results give an insight into the long-lasting impacts of chronic alcohol and stress and how they may accelerate age-related cognitive decline.",

    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Dissociation between physical reasoning and tool use in individuals with left hemisphere brain damage",
    "content": "Many everyday tasks, from chopping vegetables to catching a ball, require understanding both how objects respond to physical forces and how to use them effectively. These capacities, tool use and physical reasoning, are often assumed to rely on shared cognitive and neural mechanisms. At some level, this correspondence is expected: using an object typically requires understanding its physical properties. However, both capacities are complex and multicomponential, so the relationship between them may vary across levels of representation and task demands. Here, we asked whether third-person physical reasoning about object dynamics can dissociate from tool use (i.e., performing a tool's typical action, such as using a hammer to drive a nail) in individuals with left-hemisphere stroke. We tested 11 patients, five of whom showed impairments in tool use. Physical reasoning was assessed using a novel collection of tasks probing judgments about mass, velocity, and timing across static and dynamic scenes. Tool use was evaluated using a classic gesture-to-sight task, a pantomime-based measure in which participants are shown pictures of familiar tools and asked to demonstrate how each would be used. We identified an individual-level dissociation: patient I.A. showed impairment in gesturing the use of objects despite preserved physical reasoning, often outperforming neurotypical controls. This pattern was complemented by patient N.P., who showed the reverse profile, with intact tool use gestures but difficulties in some physical reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that the ability to reason about the physical world and tool use can dissociate behaviorally and be independently disrupted by brain damage. This challenges the view that physical reasoning and tool use draw on the same underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms and suggests that at least some of their components are distinct.",

    "title": "Genetic dissection of microglia cannibalism reveals an IL10 signaling axis controls microglia lifespan",
    "content": "The development of complex organs, like the brain, demands a robust system for tissue remodeling and cellular debris clearance. In the brain, this function is performed by microglia, which must clear diverse debris substrates, including that caused by cell death. Although the subsequent fate of these phagocytic microglia is a critical regulatory point that impacts whether the brain resolves a debris environment, the genetic mechanisms that control microglia fate after debris clearance remain mostly unknown. To address this, we conducted a large-scale CRISPR screen in zebrafish using a custom-built robotic confocal microscope. We selected candidate genes from a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of embryonic mouse microglia. This screen identified several modulators of microglial lifespan and cannibalism that are enriched in mouse and zebrafish microglia, including interleukin-10 receptor beta (il10rb), a receptor subunit for the cytokine IL10. Perturbation of il10, il10rb, and downstream signaling molecules JAK/STAT in zebrafish reduced microglial death. Expression analysis in mouse and zebrafish confirmed that microglia express both il10 and il10rb. Given the established role of IL10 in lysosomal remodeling, we hypothesized that it regulates microglial survival through lysosomal acidification. While il10rb perturbation did not alter lysosome number or size, it caused a significant reduction in LysoTracker-positive lysosomes, indicating decreased lysosomal acidification. Inhibiting v-ATPase also reduced microglial death, reinforcing the link between lysosomal pH and cell fate. Our findings reveal a cytokine-regulated mechanism where lysosomal dynamics determine the survival of phagocytic microglia. We propose that a necroptosis-cannibalism process functions as a quality control mechanism for microglial turnover, which is critical for refining neuroimmune cell function in the brain.",

    "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Intracranial electrophysiological recordings, including electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereo-EEG (sEEG), are increasingly used across research programs to study human brain function due to their high spatiotemporal resolution. Numerous tools exist for electrode localization and visualization; however, most focus on subject-level visualization and provide only partial solutions for systematic within- and across-subject analyses. It is especially important to preserve subject-specific anatomical locations while mapping electrodes to standardized spaces for analysis across multiple subjects. To address these needs, we present Mithra: a toolkit for visualizing intracranial recordings, implemented in both Python and MATLAB. The toolbox enables visualization of electrodes alongside the brain's pial surface and anatomical annotations, supports localization in common average spaces such as the MNI and FreeSurfer average brains, and maintains alignment with individual anatomy. It further allows electrode projection onto the cortical surface to generate Gaussian heatmaps representing the spatial distribution of neural activity. By integrating these capabilities into a unified framework, our toolbox provides a flexible, cross-platform solution for systematic within- and across-subject electrode visualization and analysis.",

    "content": "Age related changes in circulating exosomes are implicated in cerebrovascular aging and the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). Neurovascular dysfunction and blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown are recognized as early events in AD, often preceding amyloid{beta} deposition. Primary human brain micro endothelial cells (HBMECs) from a 38 year-old male were treated with exosomes from young (18 to 25 years) and old (65 to 72 years) donors. Whole transcriptomic RNA sequencing analysis identified 5,432 differentially expressed genes, which were organized into five transcriptional clusters. Two principal clusters demonstrated reciprocal patterns: 1) exosomes derived from serum of older adult donors (65 to 72 years) downregulated genes essential for mitochondrial function (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) and protein synthesis (e.g., ribosomal biogenesis) and 2) upregulating genes linked to inflammation, junctional remodeling, and proliferative signaling. Crucially, subsequent treatment with exosomes derived from serum of young adult donors (18 to 25 years) reversed these detrimental transcriptomic profiles via restoration of the expression of mitochondrial and ribosomal machinery toward baseline and suppressed the inflammatory and maladaptive proliferative signaling induced by exosomes derived from serum of older adult donors. These findings demonstrate that exosomes derived from serum of young adult donors can counteract detrimental signals of aging at the transcriptional level, reinforcing the cellular architecture underlying BBB integrity. This supports the therapeutic potential of using exosomes derived from serum of young adult donors to reverse endothelial aging and interrupt the early neurovascular dysfunction that contributes to the progression of AD.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-\">https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-</a></p> <p>I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't want to pay for a server, and didn't want to host one on my computer. I have a flagship phone; an S25+ with Snapdragon 8 and 12 GB RAM. It's ridiculous. I wanted to run intense computational coding on my phone, and didn't have a solution to keep my phone from overheating. So. I built one. This is non-rooted using sys-reads and Termux (found on F-Droid for sensor access) and Termux API (found on F-Droid), so you can keep your warranty. \ud83d\udd25</p> <p>What my project does: Monitors core temperatures using sys reads and Termux API. It models thermal activity using Newton's Law of Cooling to predict thermal events before they happen and prevent Samsung's aggressive performance throttling at 42\u00b0 C. </p> <p>Target audience: Developers who want to run an intensive server on an S25+ without rooting or melting their phone. </p> <p>Comparison: I haven't seen other predictive thermal modeling used on a phone before. The hardware is concrete and physics can be very good at modeling phone behavior in relation to workload patterns. Samsung itself uses a reactive and throttling system rather than predicting thermal events. Heat is continuous and temperature isn't an isolated event. </p> <p>I didn't want to pay for a server, and I was also interested in the idea of mobile computing. As my workload increased, I noticed my phone would have temperature problems and performance would degrade quickly. I studied physics and realized that the cores in my phone and the hardware components were perfect candidates for modeling with physics. By using a &quot;thermal tank&quot; where you know how much heat is going to be generated by various workloads through machine learning, you can predict thermal events before they happen and defer operations so that the 42\u00b0 C thermal throttle limit is never reached. At this limit, Samsung aggressively throttles performance by about 50%, which can cause performance problems, which can generate more heat, and the spiral can get out of hand quickly. </p> <p>My solution is simple: never reach 42\u00b0 C</p> <p>Physics-Based Thermal Prediction for Mobile Hardware - Validation Results</p> <p>Core claim: Newton's law of cooling works on phones. 0.58\u00b0C MAE over 152k predictions, 0.24\u00b0C for battery. Here's the data.</p> <p>THE PHYSICS</p> <p>Standard Newton's law: T(t) = T_amb + (T\u2080 - T_amb)\u00b7exp(-t/\u03c4) + (P\u00b7R/k)\u00b7(1 - exp(-t/\u03c4))</p> <p>Measured thermal constants per zone on Samsung S25+ (Snapdragon 8 Elite):</p> <ul> <li>Battery: \u03c4=210s, thermal mass 75 J/K (slow response)</li> <li>GPU: \u03c4=95s, thermal mass 40 J/K</li> <li>MODEM: \u03c4=80s, thermal mass 35 J/K</li> <li>CPU_LITTLE: \u03c4=60s, thermal mass 40 J/K</li> <li>CPU_BIG: \u03c4=50s, thermal mass 20 J/K</li> </ul> <p>These are from step response testing on actual hardware. Battery's 210s time constant means it lags\u2014CPUs spike first during load changes.</p> <p>Sampling at 1Hz uniform, 30s prediction horizon. Single-file architecture because filesystem I/O creates thermal overhead on mobile.</p> <p>VALIDATION DATA</p> <p>152,418 predictions over 6.25 hours continuous operation.</p> <p>Overall accuracy:</p> <ul> <li>Transient-filtered: 0.58\u00b0C MAE (95th percentile 2.25\u00b0C)</li> <li>Steady-state: 0.47\u00b0C MAE</li> <li>Raw data (all transients): 1.09\u00b0C MAE</li> <li>96.5% within 5\u00b0C</li> <li>3.5% transients during workload discontinuities</li> </ul> <p>Physics can't predict regime changes\u2014expected limitation.</p> <p>Per-zone breakdown (transient-filtered, 21,774 predictions each):</p> <ul> <li>BATTERY: 0.24\u00b0C MAE (max error 2.19\u00b0C)</li> <li>MODEM: 0.75\u00b0C MAE (max error 4.84\u00b0C)</li> <li>CPU_LITTLE: 0.83\u00b0C MAE (max error 4.92\u00b0C)</li> <li>GPU: 0.84\u00b0C MAE (max error 4.78\u00b0C)</li> <li>CPU_BIG: 0.88\u00b0C MAE (max error 4.97\u00b0C)</li> </ul> <p>Battery hits 0.24\u00b0C which matters because Samsung throttles at 42\u00b0C. CPUs sit around 0.85\u00b0C, acceptable given fast thermal response.</p> <p>Velocity-dependent performance:</p> <ul> <li>Low velocity (&lt;0.001\u00b0C/s median): 0.47\u00b0C MAE, 76,209 predictions</li> <li>High velocity (&gt;0.001\u00b0C/s): 1.72\u00b0C MAE, 76,209 predictions</li> </ul> <p>Low velocity: system behaves predictably. High velocity: thermal discontinuities break the model. Use CPU velocity &gt;3.0\u00b0C/s as regime change detector instead of trusting physics during spikes.</p> <p>STRESS TEST RESULTS</p> <p>Max load with CPUs sustained at 95.4\u00b0C, 2,418 predictions over ~6 hours.</p> <p>Accuracy during max load:</p> <ul> <li>Raw (all predictions): 8.44\u00b0C MAE</li> <li>Transients (&gt;5\u00b0C error): 32.7% of data</li> <li>Filtered (&lt;5\u00b0C error): 1.23\u00b0C MAE, 67.3% of data</li> </ul> <p>Temperature ranges observed:</p> <ul> <li>CPU_LITTLE: peaked at 95.4\u00b0C</li> <li>CPU_BIG: peaked at 81.8\u00b0C</li> <li>GPU: peaked at 62.4\u00b0C</li> <li>Battery: stayed at 38.5\u00b0C</li> </ul> <p>System tracks recovery accurately once transients pass. Can't predict the workload spike itself\u2014that's a physics limitation, not a bug.</p> <p>DESIGN CONSTRAINTS</p> <p>Mobile deployment running production workload (particle simulations + GIF encoding, 8 workers) on phone hardware. Variable thermal environments mean 10-70\u00b0C ambient range is operational reality.</p> <p>Single-file architecture (4,160 lines): Multiple module imports equal multiple filesystem reads equal thermal spikes. One file loads once, stays cached. Constraint-driven\u2014the thermal monitoring system can't be thermally expensive.</p> <p>Dual-condition throttle:</p> <ul> <li>Battery temp prediction: 0.24\u00b0C MAE, catches sustained heating (\u03c4=210s lag)</li> <li>CPU velocity &gt;3.0\u00b0C/s: catches regime changes before physics fails</li> </ul> <p>Combined approach handles both slow battery heating and fast CPU spikes.</p> <p>BOTTOM LINE</p> <p>Physics works:</p> <ul> <li>0.58\u00b0C MAE filtered</li> <li>0.47\u00b0C steady-state</li> <li>0.24\u00b0C battery (tight enough for Samsung's 42\u00b0C throttle)</li> <li>Can't predict discontinuities (3.5% transients)</li> <li>Recovers to 1.23\u00b0C MAE after spikes clear</li> </ul> <p>Constraint-driven engineering for mobile: single file, measured constants, dual-condition throttle.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-\">https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-</a></p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DaSettingsPNGN\"> /u/DaSettingsPNGN </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p37186/the_pocket_computer_how_to_run_computational/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p37186/the_pocket_computer_how_to_run_computational/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Looking at a new position, with a mission I do care about, but just got their take-home assignment and I am having some 2nd thoughts. I'm mostly a low-level engineer, HPC modeling and simulation and signal processing and the employer knows this. And this sort of thing isn't as the position was described.</p> <p>I assume this is their standard question, regardless of the candidate: </p> <hr /> <p>Please write code to download the current dataset, store the data server-side, create APIs that can retrieve the server-side stored data, and provide a UI to analyze it for items such as word count per department, historical changes over time, and a checksum for each department.</p> <p>Only implement analysis that would provide meaningful information to the user.</p> <p>Please add at least one custom metric that you believe may help inform decisions more effectively.</p> <hr /> <p>Without environment setup, they designed this to take under 6 hours. I can see it taking that long for someone who does this sort of thing every day currently, but with my background, this is completely different. </p> <p>Just looking to see if I am off-base in my assessment that this is way more than 6 hours of work or if they simply expect me to shove it into an LLM and go from there. Which is probably what I am going to do, since I need to learn a lot of new tech to do it regardless.</p> <p>--edit--</p> <p>Thanks for the feedback. Definitely feels like a lot and my inner cynic definitely leans towards them trying to take advantage of some free work. That being said, it's a company and gig I'd really like to land, so probably going to take a stab at it. Definitely going to use some LLMs to get the ball rolling, since I never used Django. My experience is almost all low-level C/C++ dev, so this is a new path for me (and one that I want to undertake). Going to probably put some mornings into it. </p> <p>First: Getting a good dev environment set up for it and getting the ingestion pipeline work with it. Will most likely just use sqlLite for the quick backend. It's ingesting most json documents, so I don't think I am going to have to do a bunch of data modeling (especially for a quick project - will make notes for the following interview discussions though).</p> <p>Morning 2: Get the personal apis up and running and maybe start a very barebones UI for it (I hate doing UI work - doing it daily got me to leave a former job).</p> <p>Morning 3: Do a bit of clean up and maybe some new metric to put in.</p> <p>I dislike using LLMs for generating code - so not thrilled about it - I know there will be massive holes in my understanding - but worst case, it will be an interesting learning experience for it. </p> <p>Thanks again for all the feedback, really appreciate it. Any further advice is appreciated as well - what type of stumbling blocks am I likely to run into, things to watch out for, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_Nomadic__\"> /u/_Nomadic__ </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p2wgpx/looking_for_a_sanity_check_on_an_interview/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p2wgpx/looking_for_a_sanity_check_on_an_interview/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Histological analysis of thrombus composition in acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion: impact of r-tPA treatment",
    "content": "Background and purposeMechanical thrombectomy advances enable detection of thrombus composition changes post-intravenous thrombolysis, but evidence remains limited. This study retrospectively analyzed thrombi obtained from mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke to explore the impact of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) on the composition of thrombi in patients with different TOAST classifications and the association between changes in thrombus components and clinical outcome data.Materials and methodsThrombus samples from 141 patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy (n\u202f=\u202f60) or bridging therapy (n\u202f=\u202f81) at two hospitals between December 2020 and January 2024 were included. Baseline data and outcome data were collected. Components were analyzed via HE staining and immunohistochemistry for CD61 and FGB, quantifying area percentages of red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), platelet-fibrin complexes (PLT\u202f+\u202fFIB), platelet (PLT), and fibrin (FIB). Thrombus components were compared between the mechanical thrombectomy and bridging therapy groups according to TOAST subtypes, and a combined analysis was conducted with clinical prognosis and surgical conditions.ResultsNo significant baseline differences (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Significant component differences between mechanical thrombectomy and bridging therapy across subtypes: in large artery atherosclerotic (LAA), FIB higher in mechanical thrombectomy (p\u202f=\u202f0.001); in cardioembolic (CE), PLT and FIB higher in mechanical thrombectomy (p\u202f=\u202f0.003, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Subtype comparisons showed differences: LAA vs. CE in RBC, PLT\u202f+\u202fFIB, PLT, FIB (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); LAA vs. stroke of undetermined source (SUE) in PLT and FIB (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); CE vs. SUE in FIB (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionThis study quantified the thrombus components of different etiologies and found that IVT could reduce the FIB content in thrombi of large artery occlusion cerebral infarction, especially in the LAA type. The platelet content in the LAA type was higher than that in the CE and the SUE types. The FIB level in the SUE type was higher than that in the CE type. FIB was not only present in the PLT area but also in the RBC area. IVT may improve thrombectomy success by disrupting thrombus structure, but it can increase fragment embolization and prolong procedure time.",

    "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
    "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

    "content": "Objective. Low back pain (LBP) is a significant public health issue. Despite current medical imaging and neurophysiological tests, up to 90% of patients lack a clear cause, leading to a diagnosis of chronic primary LBP (CPLP). Non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was employed to detect spinal cord dysfunctions by recording perispinal neurovascular response (NVR). Approach. In a prospective study of 71 CPLP patients and 65 healthy age-matched volunteers, pain maps, visual analog scale (VAS), body mass index (BMI), posterior tibial nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and lumbar and cervical NVRs triggered by non-noxious electrical stimulation of this nerve were assessed. Main results. CPLP patients exhibited a 53.29% reduction in NVR amplitude at the cervical level compared to the controls, with no significant difference at the lumbar level. CPLP patients compared to controls show a rise time of 6.64% and 5.14% larger in cervical and lumbar recordings, respectively, but a duration of 10.11% and 5.32% shorter, respectively. Posterior tibial NCV was within normal clinical range in both groups. In CPLP patients, VAS scores were negatively correlated with NVR rise time, amplitude, and duration at the lumbar site, as well as with rise time and duration at the cervical site (p < 0.05). Additionally, BMI showed a negative correlation with all NVR parameters at both recording sites in CPLP patients, but not in controls (p < 0.05). Significance. This is the first report of perispinal NVR dysfunction in patients with CPLP. Its results suggest a loss of inhibitory regulation in the lumbar spinal cord in CPLP patients and demonstrate the potential of fNIRS to detect and quantify spinal cord neurovascular dysfunctions. For the first time, perispinal NVR dysfunction is reported in CPLP patients, suggesting an altered descending modulation system at the lumbar spinal cord.",

    "title": "Deployable electrode arrays for brain interfaces: structural reconfiguration strategies for long-term stability and high-fidelity recording\u2014a review",
    "content": "Objective. Neural electrode arrays, as essential tools for recording and stimulating neural tissues, significantly impact therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders through deep brain stimulation, responsive neurostimulation, and brain-computer interfaces. Despite considerable advancements, the efficiency and longevity of neural electrode arrays are compromised by brain micromotion, induced by physiological activities such as cardiac pulsation and respiration. The mechanical mismatch between rigid electrode arrays and soft neural tissue generates persistent stresses at the electrode-tissue interface, triggering tissue damage, inflammatory responses, encapsulation, and ultimately electrode failure. Deployable neural electrode arrays, characterized by structural reconfiguration after implantation, have emerged to address these challenges. Deployment mechanisms, including unfolding, expanding, unrolling, or ejecting electrode arms from an initially compact configuration, reduce insertion trauma, maximize spatial coverage, and mitigate brain micromotion effects, thereby enhancing long-term stability and recording fidelity. Approach. This review provides the first comprehensive analysis of deployable intracortical and electrocorticography electrode arrays, emphasizing their design principles, deployment mechanisms, mechanical performance, advantages, and limitations. Main results. This review fills a critical gap in the existing neural electrode literature by transitioning the focus from traditional geometric and material considerations to advanced structural reconfiguration strategies. Significance. An understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of these deployment strategies provides essential insights and future directions for optimizing neural electrode technologies.",

    "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
    "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "title": "Feasibility of decoding cerebellar movement-related potentials for brain-computer interface applications",
    "content": "Objective. In brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, signals are conventionally acquired from the cerebrum, and only a subset of the complex interactions that occur in several areas of the brain are collected. One area that has not been investigated for BCI application is the cerebellum, despite its involvement in movement and executive function. The present study aimed to determine the features of movement-related cerebellar electrocerebellography (ECeG) that are most useful for decoding, and how performance compares with conventional electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the cerebrum. Approach. ECeG and EEG data were collected from six healthy adults to identify useful movement-related features from both cerebrum and cerebellum. Electromyography was used to capture the movements from the muscles. Decoding was conducted in binary movement vs. rest and movement vs. movement systems using support vector machines. Decoding performance was compared between cerebral, cerebellar, a combination of both, and temporal groups. Re-referencing techniques were applied to compensate for possible common reference artefacts or volume conduction effects. Main results. Movement-related features were decoded from over the cerebellum and the cerebrum. Classification accuracies were similar in both the cerebrum and cerebellum, when classifying movement vs. rest (cerebrum: 0.78 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.70 \u00b1 0.01) and movement vs. movement states (cerebrum: 0.76 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.71 \u00b1 0.02). The delta band (1\u20133 Hz) was the most useful feature for decoding. Significance. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that ECeG is a feasible source of movement related signals for implementing a BCI. The present study also demonstrated that the ECeG closely resembled the EEG signals and represents an alternate approach for BCI where the signal from the cerebrum is unreliable either due to disease or injury.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "content": "Spindles and slow oscillations (SO) are fundamental elements of the NREM sleep microarchitecture, often co-occurring in a phase-dependent manner, and this cross-frequency coupling is critical for the temporal coordination of neural activity in sleep. However, spindles and SO occur at different times in different regions, and it is unclear how the coupling of these oscillations is organized across the brain. Here, we provide evidence in humans for a novel spatiotemporal organization of spindle-SO coupling, characterized by a precession of the SO phase of spindles along the brain's anterior-posterior axis. We show that this phase precession relationship is a robust phenomenon and can be quantified across individual subjects. Moreover, the integrity of phase precession strength and slope declines with advancing age. These findings provide new insight into the temporal coordination of sleep rhythms across brain space, linking this coordination to a canonical principle of neural coding.",

    "title": "The fluctuation-based regime of thalamocortical circuitry",
    "content": "Neocortical neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) integrate excitatory inputs from both thalamic and cortical sources to generate selectivity for orientation, direction and disparity. Feedforward models have posited that thalamocortical input can drive these selectivities, but the relative sparsity of thalamic synapses raises questions about the sufficiency of this input. To determine whether thalamic drive is sufficient to evoke cortical responses, we quantified the current threshold required to evoke action potentials in vivo using whole-cell recordings in mouse V1. We then isolated thalamic input via optogenetic cortical silencing and compared its strength to the measured spiking threshold. We find that although average thalamic input is below the threshold for action potential generation, trial-by-trial fluctuations in thalamic drive are sufficient to evoke visually driven action potentials. These results demonstrate that thalamic excitation alone can drive cortical spiking, but its effectiveness depends on fluctuations in synaptic input.",

    "content": "Awe is a positive emotion often accompanied by sensations of vastness and unity, with known benefits for well-being and social behavior. However, its neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. We recorded EEG and autonomic physiology in 23 healthy older participants while they watched a nature-based audiovisual film, The Nature Journey, and subjective ratings of awe were recorded. Awe was associated with decreased alpha and theta spectral power, and increased Lempel Ziv complexity (LZC) - indicating heightened neural signal entropy and increased information processing. These effects partially converged across datasets and awe induction methods, supporting their generalizability. Notably, awe-related increases in LZC correlated with reduced sympathetic activity and greater self-reported awe intensity, but not self-reported joy, suggesting some level of specificity. These results suggest that awe evokes distinctive neurophysiological states linked to both autonomic changes and subjective experience.",

    "content": "Synaptic dysfunction and resulting imbalance of excitatory vs. inhibitory transmission are fundamental aspects of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here we addressed the role of inhibitory synapse disturbances in ASD employing mice with a conditional ablation in inhibitory forebrain interneurons of the presynaptic active zone scaffolding protein Bassoon (Bsn), a key factor in synaptic development, activity and maintenance. The conditional Bsn gene knock out resulted in a reduction of synaptic vesicles and reduced synaptic efficacy of affected inhibitory synapses as well as diminished GABAergic inhibition in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Bsn mutants further displayed a reconfiguration of the hippocampal synaptic network in vivo, as seen in subfield-specific changes of inhibitory synaptic markers and reduced numbers of parvalbumin interneurons, culminating in disturbance of hippocampal network activity patterns and profound mitochondrial and metabolic dysregulation. Importantly, the mutant mice developed behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of ASD including widespread social behavioral deficits and novelty-induced hyperarousal with altered motor behavior, increased anxiety and epileptiform activity. Bsn conditional knock out mice thus provide strong evidence for a causal involvement of GABAergic synapses in the emergence of ASD-related behavioral and physiological phenotypes.",

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder.

    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41).

Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For the past 4 months, I\u2019ve been working on a full-stack project I\u2019m really proud of called <a href=\"https://pytogether.org\">PyTogether</a> (pytogether.org).</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>It is a real-time, collaborative Python IDE designed with beginners in mind (think Google Docs, but for Python). It\u2019s meant for pair programming, tutoring, or just coding Python together. It\u2019s completely free. No subscriptions, no ads, nothing. Just create an account, make a group, and start a project. Has proper code-linting, extremely intuitive UI, autosaving, drawing features (you can draw directly onto the IDE and scroll), live selections, and voice/live chats per project. There are no limitations at the moment (except for code size to prevent malicious payloads). There is also built-in support for libraries like matplotlib.</p> <p>Source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/SJRiz/pytogether\">https://github.com/SJRiz/pytogether</a></p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>It\u2019s designed for tutors, educators, or Python beginners.</p> <h1>Comparison With Existing Alternatives</h1> <p>Why build this when Replit or VS Code Live Share already exist?</p> <p>Because my goal was simplicity and education. I wanted something lightweight for beginners who just want to write and share simple Python scripts (alone or with others), without downloads, paywalls, or extra noise. There\u2019s also no AI/copilot built in, something many teachers and learners actually prefer. I also focused on a communication-first approach, where the IDE is the &quot;focus&quot; of communication (hence why I added tools like drawing, voice/live chats, etc).</p> <h1>Project Information</h1> <p>Tech stack (frontend):</p> <p>React + TailwindCSS</p> <p>CodeMirror for linting</p> <p>Y.js for real-time syncing and live cursors</p> <p>I use Pyodide for Python execution directly in the browser, this means you can actually use advanced libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib while staying fully client-side and sandboxed for safety.</p> <p>I don\u2019t enjoy frontend or UI design much, so I leaned on AI for some design help, but all the logic/code is mine. Deployed via Vercel.</p> <p>Tech stack (backend):</p> <p>Django (channels, auth, celery/redis support made it a great fit, though I plan to replace the celery worker with Go later so it'll be faster)</p> <p>PostgreSQL via Supabase</p> <p>JWT + OAuth authentication</p> <p>Redis for channel layers + caching</p> <p>Fully Dockerized + deployed on a VPS (8GB RAM, $7/mo deal)</p> <p>Data models:</p> <p>Users &lt;-&gt; Groups -&gt; Projects -&gt; Code</p> <p>Users can join many groups</p> <p>Groups can have multiple projects</p> <p>Each project belongs to one group and has one code file (kept simple for beginners, though I may add a file system later).</p> <p>My biggest technical challenges were around performance and browser execution. One major hurdle was getting Pyodide to work smoothly in a real-time collaborative setup. I had to run it inside a Web Worker to handle synchronous I/O (since input() is blocking), though I was able to find a library that helped me do this more efficiently (pyodide-worker-runner). This let me support live input/output and plotting in the browser without freezing the UI, while still allowing multiple users to interact with the same Python session collaboratively.</p> <p>Another big challenge was designing a reliable and efficient autosave system. I couldn\u2019t just save on every keystroke as that would hammer the database. So I designed a Redis-based caching layer that tracks active projects in memory, and a Celery worker that loops through them every minute to persist changes to the database. When all users leave a project, it saves and clears from cache. This setup also doubles as my channel layer for real-time updates and my Celery broker; reusing Redis for everything while keeping things fast and scalable.</p> <p>Deployment on a VPS was another beast. I spent ~8 hours wrangling Nginx, Certbot, Docker, and GitHub Actions to get everything up and running. It was frustrating, but I learned a lot.</p> <p>If you\u2019re curious or if you wanna see the work yourself, the source code is here.

    "title": "Brainwave patterns during a mock job interview among Thai undergraduate students",
    "content": "This study examined the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to measure real-time cognitive engagement during English-speaking tasks among Thai undergraduate students. A total of 41 participants took part in a mock job interview while wearing a five-channel EEG headset, which captured brain activity in the beta and gamma frequency bands. The EEG data were analyzed to identify variations in neural activation associated with speaking performance. Descriptive analyses revealed that participants with higher speaking scores generally exhibited increased beta and gamma wave activity, indicating greater attentional focus and semantic processing. However, nonparametric tests showed no statistically significant differences in neural activation between the lowest- and highest-scoring groups, suggesting that cognitive engagement may not always correspond directly with observable speaking performance. These results emphasize that even lower-performing learners may exhibit strong mental effort during communication, and that EEG can serve as a valuable tool for understanding hidden cognitive processes and informing more personalized language instruction and assessment.",

    "title": "NeuroGaze: a hybrid EEG and eye-tracking brain-computer interface for hands-free interaction in virtual reality",
    "content": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have traditionally been studied in clinical and laboratory contexts, but the rise of consumer-grade devices now allows exploration of their use in daily activities. Virtual reality (VR) provides a particularly relevant domain, where existing input methods often force trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and physical effort. This study introduces NeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye tracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR. Twenty participants completed a 360\u00b0 cube-selection task using three different input methods: VR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance was measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). NeuroGaze successfully supported target selection with off-the-shelf hardware, producing fewer errors than the alternative methods but requiring longer completion times, reflecting a classic speed-accuracy tradeoff. Workload analysis indicated reduced physical demand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user preferences were mixed. While the differing confirmation pipelines limit direct comparison of throughput metrics, NeuroGaze is positioned as a feasibility study illustrating trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and accessibility. It highlights the potential of consumer-grade BCIs for long-duration use and emphasizes the need for improved EEG signal processing and adaptive multimodal integration to enhance future performance.",

    "title": "Extent and activity of adult hippocampal neurogenesis",
    "content": "Our understanding of adult neurogenesis has advanced far since Joseph Altman reported newborn neurons in the adult rodent brain over 60 years ago, but only recently have we been able to directly interrogate its role in the brain. While the olfactory-associated neurogenesis seen in the subventricular zone of many other mammals is greatly diminished in humans, hippocampal neurogenesis persists and may have important roles for learning, memory, and emotional regulation. A reduction in neurogenesis may play a role in neurodegenerative disease, and recent studies have suggested that hippocampal neurogenesis counteracts age-associated cognitive decline. Neurogenesis is also negatively impacted by chronic stress, a major contributor to a wide variety of psychiatric disorders. Interestingly, antidepressants have been shown to enhance neurogenesis, and some of their behavioral effects are driven by newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Little is known, however, about how these newborn neurons integrate into and contribute to the neural circuitry of the hippocampus. Recent evidence suggests that the behavioral implications of neurogenesis are driven by the activity of newborn neurons, which may or may not be coupled to the extent of cell proliferation. This review discusses what is known about these two elements of neurogenesis, and how a complete picture of both is necessary to fully understand their physiological implications.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

    "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.15723v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quantifying numerical data involves addressing two key challenges: first, determining whether the data can be naturally quantified, and second, identifying the numerical intervals or ranges of values that correspond to specific value classes, referred to as \"quantums,\" which represent statistically meaningful states. If such quantification is feasible, continuous streams of numerical data can be transformed into sequences of \"symbols\" that reflect the states of the system described by the measured parameter. People often perform this task intuitively, relying on common sense or practical experience, while information theory and computer science offer computable metrics for this purpose. In this study, we assess the applicability of metrics based on information compression and the Silhouette coefficient for quantifying numerical data. We also investigate the extent to which these metrics correlate with one another and with what is commonly referred to as \"human intuition.\" Our findings suggest that the ability to classify numeric data values into distinct categories is associated with a Silhouette coefficient above 0.65 and a Dip Test below 0.5; otherwise, the data can be treated as following a unimodal normal distribution. Furthermore, when quantification is possible, the Silhouette coefficient appears to align more closely with human intuition than the \"normalized centroid distance\" method derived from information compression perspective.",

Predictive maintenance systems powered by supervised machine learning offer a promising approach by detecting failures before they occur, reducing unscheduled downtime, and improving operational efficiency. However, the success of such systems depends on high quality labeled data, necessitating user centered labeling interfaces tailored to annotators needs for Usability and User Experience. This study introduces a cost effective predictive maintenance system developed in the federally funded project DigiOnTrack, which combines structure borne noise measurement with supervised learning to provide monitoring and maintenance recommendations for rail vehicles and infrastructure in rural Germany. The system integrates wireless sensor networks, distributed ledger technology for secure data transfer, and a dockerized container infrastructure hosting the labeling interface and dashboard. Train drivers and workshop foremen labeled faults on infrastructure and vehicles to ensure accurate recommendations. The Usability and User Experience evaluation showed that the locomotive drivers interface achieved Excellent Usability, while the workshop foremans interface was rated as Good. These results highlight the systems potential for integration into daily workflows, particularly in labeling efficiency. However, areas such as Perspicuity require further optimization for more data intensive scenarios. The findings offer insights into the design of predictive maintenance systems and labeling interfaces, providing a foundation for future guidelines in Industry 4.0 applications, particularly in rail transportation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.16245v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Comprehensively interpreting human behavior is a core challenge in human-aware artificial intelligence. However, prior works typically focused on body behavior, neglecting the crucial role of eye gaze and its synergy with body motion. We present GazeInterpreter - a novel large language model-based (LLM-based) approach that parses eye gaze data to generate eye-body-coordinated narrations. Specifically, our method features 1) a symbolic gaze parser that translates raw gaze signals into symbolic gaze events; 2) a hierarchical structure that first uses an LLM to generate eye gaze narration at semantic level and then integrates gaze with body motion within the same observation window to produce integrated narration; and 3) a self-correcting loop that iteratively refines the modality match, temporal coherence, and completeness of the integrated narration. This hierarchical and iterative processing can effectively align physical values and semantic text in the temporal and spatial domains. We validated the effectiveness of our eye-body-coordinated narrations on the text-driven motion generation task in the large-scale Nymeria benchmark. Moreover, we report significant performance improvements for the sample downstream tasks of action anticipation and behavior summarization. Taken together, these results reveal the significant potential of parsing eye gaze to interpret human behavior and open up a new direction for human behavior understanding.",

    "title": "When Less is More: A Story of Failing Bayesian Optimization Due to Additional Expert Knowledge",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.16230v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The compounding of plastics with recycled material remains a practical challenge, as the properties of the processed material is not as easy to control as with completely new raw materials. For a data scientist, it makes sense to plan the necessary experiments in the development of new compounds using Bayesian Optimization, an optimization approach based on a surrogate model that is known for its data efficiency and is therefore well suited for data obtained from costly experiments. Furthermore, if historical data and expert knowledge are available, their inclusion in the surrogate model is expected to accelerate the convergence of the optimization. In this article, we describe a use case in which the addition of data and knowledge has impaired optimization. We also describe the unsuccessful methods that were used to remedy the problem before we found the reasons for the poor performance and achieved a satisfactory result. We conclude with a lesson learned: additional knowledge and data are only beneficial if they do not complicate the underlying optimization goal.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.16214v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People today are overwhelmed by massive amounts of information, leading to cognitive overload and memory burden. Traditional visual memory augmentation methods are either effortful and disruptive or fail to align with user intent. To address these limitations, we propose Gaze Archive, a novel visual memory enhancement paradigm through active logging on smart glasses. It leverages human gaze as a natural attention indicator, enabling both intent-precise capture and effortless-and-unobtrusive interaction. To implement Gaze Archive, we develop GAHMA, a technical framework that enables compact yet intent-aligned memory encoding and intuitive memory recall based on natural language queries. Quantitative experiments on our newly constructed GAVER dataset show that GAHMA achieves more intent-precise logging than non-gaze baselines. Through extensive user studies in both laboratory and real-world scenarios, we compare Gaze Archive with other existing memory augmentation methods. Results demonstrate its advantages in perceived effortlessness, unobtrusiveness and overall preference, showing strong potential for real-world deployment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.16133v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Beyond a simple notification of incoming calls or messages, more complex information such as alphabets and digits can be delivered through spatiotemporal tactile patterns (STPs) on a wrist-worn tactile display (WTD) with multiple tactors. However, owing to the limited skin area and spatial acuity of the wrist, frequent confusions occur between closely located tactors, resulting in a low recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the accuracies reported in previous studies have mostly been measured for a specific posture and could further decrease with free arm postures in real life. Herein, we present Heterogeneous Stroke, a design concept for improving the recognition accuracy of STPs on a WTD. By assigning unique vibrotactile stimuli to each tactor, the confusion between tactors can be reduced. Through our implementation of Heterogeneous Stroke, the alphanumeric characters could be delivered with high accuracy (93.8% for 26 alphabets and 92.4% for 10 digits) across different arm postures.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce an interactive system built on a novel, dual-hybrid pipeline. The first stage combines landmark-based auto-detection with a manual framing tool for robust, artist-centric face preparation. The second stage maps expressions using the LivePortrait engine, blending intuitive performative input from video for fine-grained control. Our case study analysis suggests that this integrated workflow can streamline the creative process and effectively translate narrative intent into visual expression. This work presents a practical model for human-AI co-creation, offering artists a more direct and intuitive means of ``infusing souls'' into their characters. Our primary contribution is not a new generative model, but a novel, interactive workflow that bridges the gap between artistic intent and AI execution.",

Unlike prior work that persuades via overt-partisan bias or misinformation, we test whether framing alone suffices. We conducted a crowdsourced study, where 336 participants interacted with a neutral or one of two value-framed ChatBots while deciding to alter US defense spending. In this single policy domain with controlled content, participants exposed to value-framed ChatBots significantly changed their budget choices relative to the neutral control. When the frame misaligned with their values, some participants reinforced their original preference, revealing a potentially replicable backfire effect, originally considered rare in the literature. These findings suggest that value-framing alone lowers the barrier for manipulative uses of LLMs, revealing risks distinct from overt bias or misinformation, and clarifying risks to countering misinformation.",

    "title": "Measuring and Controlling Solution Degeneracy across Task-Trained Recurrent Neural Networks",
    "content": "arXiv:2410.03972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Task-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience and machine learning to model dynamical computations. To gain mechanistic insight into how neural systems solve tasks, prior work often reverse-engineers individual trained networks. However, different RNNs trained on the same task and achieving similar performance can exhibit strikingly different internal solutions, a phenomenon known as solution degeneracy. Here, we develop a unified framework to systematically quantify and control solution degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We apply this framework to 3,400 RNNs trained on four neuroscience-relevant tasks: flip-flop memory, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration, while systematically varying task complexity, learning regime, network size, and regularization. We find that higher task complexity and stronger feature learning reduce degeneracy in neural dynamics but increase it in weight space, with mixed effects on behavior. In contrast, larger networks and structural regularization reduce degeneracy at all three levels. These findings empirically validate the Contravariance Principle and provide practical guidance for researchers seeking to tune the variability of RNN solutions, either to uncover shared neural mechanisms or to model the individual variability observed in biological systems. This work provides a principled framework for quantifying and controlling solution degeneracy in task-trained RNNs, offering new tools for building more interpretable and biologically grounded models of neural computation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2507.05268v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the brain and external devices through electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing decoding models often mix common and personalized components, leading to interference from individual variability that limits cross-subject decoding performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a system filter that extends the concept of signal filtering to the system level. The method expands a system into its spectral representation, selectively removes unnecessary components, and reconstructs the system from the retained target components, thereby achieving explicit system-level decomposition and filtering. We further integrate the system filter into a Cross-Subject Decoding framework based on the System Filter (CSD-SF) and evaluate it on the four-class motor imagery (MI) task of the BCIC IV 2a dataset. Personalized models are transformed into relation spectrums, and statistical testing across subjects is used to remove personalized components. The remaining stable relations, representing common components across subjects, are then used to construct a common model for cross-subject decoding. Experimental results show an average improvement of 3.28% in decoding accuracy over baseline methods, demonstrating that the proposed system filter effectively isolates stable common components and enhances model robustness and generalizability in cross-subject EEG decoding.",

    "title": "A Tripartite Framework for Understanding the Embodied Mind: A Comprehensive Review of Bodily Map Study",
    "content": "arXiv:2504.14865v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: People often speak of being \"moved beyond words\" when witnessing awe-inspiring natural beauty, experiencing profound moral elevation, or encountering powerful works of art and music. Such moments evoke intensely embodied sensations - a swelling in the chest, a quickened heartbeat, or a sudden stillness that floods the entire body. These experiences are difficult to articulate, yet they are vividly real and spatially anchored in bodily experience. This review examines the emerging method of body mapping, which captures how individuals subjectively localize emotional sensations across the body. Drawing on over two dozen empirical studies, we propose a tripartite framework for understanding the origins of emotional bodily maps: (1) bottom-up physiological signals, (2) top-down behavioral engagement (including motor actions), and (3) conceptual and metaphorical constructions. Crucially, we argue that bodily maps are not mere reflections of physiological monitoring, but expressive interfaces between brain, body, and conceptualization. Because they rely on introspective sensation rather than verbal articulation, bodily maps offer a promising language-independent tool for assessing emotional experience - particularly in cross-cultural research, developmental studies, and clinical contexts where verbal reporting may be limited or unreliable. Ultimately, bodily maps reveal the hidden geography of emotion-those feelings that elude precise definition or verbalization, like being moved beyond words, yet are undeniably real and embodied - offering a compelling window into how emotions are formed, shared, and lived through the body.",

To offer clarification, we propose a core set of conceptual dimensions that characterize representations in neuroscience. These dimensions describe relations between a neural response, features that may be represented, and downstream effects of the neural response. A neural response may be shown to be sensitive and specific to a feature, invariant to other features, and functional, which means that it is used downstream in the brain. We use information-theoretic measures to introduce these conceptual dimensions unambiguously and explain how data analysis methods such as correlational analyses, decoding and encoding models, representational similarity analysis, and tests of statistical dependence or adaptation relate to our framework. We consider several canonical examples, including the representation of orientation, numerosity, and spatial location, which illustrate how the evidence put forth in support or criticism of representational conclusions is systematized by our framework. By offering a unified conceptual framework we hope to aid the comparison and integration of results across studies and research groups and to help determine when evidence for a representational conclusion is strong.",

To better understand the effects of these frequencies in the neuron dynamics, we have simulated a neuronal network of Izhikevich neurons to examine the interaction between frequency allocation and intermittent phase synchronization dynamics. As the synchronized population of neurons passes through a bifurcation, an additional frequency mode emerges, enabling a match in the mean frequency while retaining distinct most probable frequencies among neurons. Subsequently, the network intermittently transits between two patterns, one partially synchronized and the other unsynchronized. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the frequency changes on the network lead to characteristic transition times between synchronization states. Moreover, these transitions adhere to beat frequency statistics when the neurons' frequencies differ by multiples of a frequency gap. Finally, our results can improve the performance in predicting transitions on problems where the beat frequency strongly influences the dynamics.",

Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "content": "The entorhinal cortex (ERC) is implicated in early progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we investigated the impact of established biological risk factors for AD, including APOE genotype (E2 versus E4 alleles), sex, and ancestry, on gene expression in the human ERC. We generated paired spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data (snRNA-seq) in postmortem human ERC tissue from middle aged brain donors with no history of AD. APOE-dependent changes in gene expression predominantly mapped to a transcriptionally-defined oligodendrocyte subtype, which varied substantially with ancestry, and suggested differences in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Integration of SRT and snRNA-seq data identified a common gene expression signature associated with APOE genotype, which we localized to the same oligodendrocyte subtype and a white matter spatial domain. This suggests that AD risk in ERC may be associated with disrupted oligodendrocyte function, potentially contributing to future neurodegeneration.",

    "title": "Synchronization of two active ears via binaural coupling",
    "content": "The two ears of many non-mammalian vertebrates are acoustically coupled through an interaural cavity. Sounds can hit both the external and internal surfaces of the tympanic membranes, providing mechanical directional sensitivity for sound localization. This coupling may also give rise to binaural synchronization. In other words, each inner ear could influence the function of the other. Previous work in lizards demonstrates that binaural coupling affects the spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) measured at each external auditory meatus, with properties indicative of binaural synchronization. However, it is unclear how binaural coupling and, consequently, synchronization contribute to SOAE generation, which is typically modelled as being localized to an individual ear. We simultaneously measured SOAEs at both ears of green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and found robust relationships between them, including evidence that binaural synchronization could not be attributed to one ear uniformly driving the other. Instead, we observed frequency-dependent phase-locking between the two ears, primarily at frequencies where SOAE peaks occurred in both ears. While some pairs of ears were more strongly synchronized than others, we consistently found that binaural coupling could have greater effects on the resulting emissions than the coupling between generators within the same ear. We propose a framework for active hearing that incorporates binaural coupling, accounting for its effects on SOAE generation and sound localization in the green anole.",

    "title": "Epigenetic editing of Cartpt promotes acquisition and extinction of cocaine memory",
    "content": "In classic disease models, removing a pathological insult restores homeostasis. Yet, addiction persists far beyond the period of active drug use. Cocaine abstinence induces changes in gene expression and neuronal signaling in reward-related brain regions that limit recovery during abstinence. We found that 2 weeks of abstinence increased Cartpt (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) in the mouse nucleus accumbens and decreased repressive H3K27me3 at the Cartpt locus. While endogenous CART peptide is best described for its anorexigenic function, it is also implicated in human addiction and dopamine homeostasis. To test the causal relevance of Cartpt chromatin remodeling, we used CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools, dCas9-FOG1 and dCas9-JMJC-ZF, to manipulate H3K27me3 at Cartpt in vivo. Enriching H3K27me3 in D1 neurons repressed Cartpt expression and augmented acquisition and extinction of cocaine preference. These results show that CRISPR epigenetic editing can recapitulate endogenous chromatin states to modulate addiction-related behavior, highlighting broad therapeutic potential of both Cartpt and epigenetic editing.",

    "title": "Developmental deviations of structural connectivity in youths with ADHD predict symptom and treatment outcomes",
    "content": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) lacks validated biomarkers to track symptom development or guide treatment selection in youth. We quantified individual deviations from normative age-related trajectories of white-matter structural connectivity (SC) across two independent cohorts: 6,687 typically developing and 1,114 ADHD scans from the ABCD study, and 292 typically developing and 482 ADHD participants from a Chinese cohort. Youth with ADHD showed pronounced SC deviations, especially in higher-order association pathways. A subset of connections showed ADHD-specific developmental reductions in deviations beyond typical developmental patterns, and these changes mediated the age-related decline in ADHD symptoms. Longitudinal within-individual analyses demonstrated that decreases in deviation over two years tracked symptom improvement. Baseline deviations also predicted 12-week treatment response to atomoxetine, but not methylphenidate, and follow-up imaging revealed treatment-related reductions in deviation. Together, these findings identify SC deviation as a robust developmental biomarker with prognostic and theragnostic relevance for ADHD, supporting precision care through risk stratification, individualized pharmacotherapy selection, and objective monitoring of treatment effects.",

    "title": "Pathogenic IgG from long COVID patients with neurological sequelae triggers sensitive but not cognitive impairments upon transfer into mice",
    "content": "Approximately 30% of long COVID patients still experience neurological symptoms (brain fog, pain, chronic fatigue) more than 4 months after the onset of COVID-19. This condition, known as neurological long COVID, remains poorly understood and might be explained by a persisting autoimmune response against nervous-derived self-antigens. The aim of this study is to determine whether IgG autoantibodies from long COVID patients with neurological sequelae can bind to central or peripheral nervous system epitopes and triggers neuropsychiatric symptoms upon passive transfer into mice, thereby mirroring patient-reported manifestations. Long COVID patients meeting the 2021 consensus WHO definition were included following a standardized neuropsychological assessment, while excluding patients with a medical history of autoimmune and neurological disorders. Age- and sex-matched asymptomatic individuals were used as healthy controls. Total IgGs were isolated using protein G purification and injected intraperitoneally into C57Bl6/J mice for four consecutive days. During the two weeks post-injections, behavioral tests assessed mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, spatial working memory, depression, and anxiety. Mice injected with IgG from long COVID patients showed no difference with the control group in terms of anxiety or depression behaviors, as well as no impairment of short- or long-term spatial memories and thermal hyperalgesia. However, they displayed a transient decrease of paw withdrawal threshold during the first week. This effect was abolished when IgG-depleted serum or papain-digested IgGs were transferred. IgG from long COVID patients accumulated in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of injected mice and colocalized with proprioceptive and nociceptive sensory neurons, without inducing local neuroinflammation or astrogliosis. These data demonstrate that IgGs from long COVID patients bind to peripheral sensory neurons and induce pain-related symptoms in mice. Our findings also support the hypothesis that autoantibodies mediate pain-related pathophysiology in the spectrum of long COVID symptoms.",

    "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
    "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

    "title": "Changes in muscle activation and joint motion during walking after transtibial amputation with sensory feedback from spinal cord stimulation: a case study",
    "content": "Objective. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on muscle activity during walking after lower-limb amputation. Amputation results in a loss of sensory feedback and alterations in gait biomechanics, including co-contractions of antagonist muscles about the knee and ankle, and reduced pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop. SCS can restore sensation in the missing limb, but its effects on muscle activation and gait biomechanics have not been studied in people with lower-limb amputation. Approach. This case study included a participant with transtibial amputation who was implanted percutaneously with SCS electrodes over the lumbosacral enlargement for 84 d. SCS was used during in-lab experiments to provide somatosensory feedback from the missing limb, relaying a sense of plantar pressure when the prosthesis was in the stance phase of the gait cycle. We used electromyography (EMG) to record muscle activity from the residual and intact limbs, and 3D motion capture to measure pelvic obliquity and knee and ankle joint angles. EMG signals were recorded during walking with and without SCS at early (Day 30) and late (Day 63) time points across the implant duration. Main results. During walking, co-contraction of knee antagonist muscles was reduced following multiple sessions of SCS-mediated sensory restoration. Additionally, the activation of the hip abductor (tensor fasciae latae) muscle increased activity during gait with SCS-mediated sensory restoration, which corresponded to an increase in pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop, towards normal. Significance. Restoring sensation in the missing limb using SCS altered muscle activity during walking led to improved coordination and pelvic motion in an individual with lower-limb amputation.",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "<p>People always want to know what the point of life is. Why are they on earth? What are we doing here? Whats our purpose? <em>Whats the point?</em></p>\n<p>For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth.</p>\n<p>As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress.</p>\n<p>I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings.

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "Cumulative timing-dependent changes in corticospinal excitability during suprathreshold paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation",
    "content": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used to assess inhibitory and facilitatory circuits within the primary motor cortex. However, accumulating evidence suggests that even brief TMS paradigms may induce unintended changes in corticospinal excitability. Here, we examined whether suprathreshold paired-pulse TMS delivered at inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) associated with intracortical facilitation or long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) elicits cumulative changes in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. In experiment 1, we reanalysed data from 17 participants who received 20 suprathreshold paired-pulses at eight ISIs (10-200 ms) and 40 unconditioned single pulses. Stimulation was pseudo-randomised and distributed evenly across four blocks. A linear mixed-effects model assessed trial-wise changes in MEP amplitude across ISIs. We replicated the design in an independent sample (n=10, experiment 2). A significant trial-by-ISI interaction was observed in both cohorts. Specifically, MEP amplitudes increased across trials for ISIs of 20 and 30 ms (p<0.05), but remained stable at LICI-related ISIs (100-150 ms). A similar increase was also seen with single-pulse TMS. These findings demonstrate that suprathreshold paired-pulse TMS at short ISIs can cumulatively enhance corticospinal excitability during stimulation. Furthermore, the results suggest potential for using these protocols not just for probing cortical circuits, but also as interventions to modulate motor system excitability.",

    "title": "Age-Dependent Effects of Paraquat-Induced Parkinsonism on Serum Alpha-Synuclein Expression, Substantia Nigra Histoarchitecture and Neurobehaviour in Male Wistar Rats",
    "content": "Background Paraquat (PQ), a widely used herbicide, has been implicated in Parkinsons disease (PD)-like neurodegeneration through oxidative stress and alpha-synuclein (a-syn) dysregulation. Age is a critical determinant of vulnerability to neurotoxins. This study investigated age-dependent effects of paraquat-induced Parkinsonism on serum a-syn expression, substantia nigra histoarchitecture, and neurobehavior in male Wistar rats. Methods Sixty-three male Wistar rats were stratified into juvenile, young-adult, and adult cohorts and assigned to control, paraquat, or PQ+Recovery groups (n = 7). Paraquat (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered twice weekly for three weeks; recovery animals were monitored for two months. Neurobehavioral tests including hanging wire, open field, and Y-maze were conducted at baseline, post-exposure, and post-recovery. Serum and substantia nigra a-syn were quantified using ELISA, and histology assessed cytoarchitectural changes. Data were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA (p is less than or equal to 0.05). Results Neurobehavioral outcomes showed no significant differences in spontaneous alternation across cohorts. Latency-to-fall remained stable in young-adult and juvenile rats but declined in adult PQ+Recovery animals (p = 0.05). Line crossings decreased in adult paraquat rats (p = 0.02). Urine pools decreased significantly in young-adult paraquat (p = 0.0010) and PQ+Recovery groups (p = 0.0016), with group effects in young-adult (p = 0.007) and juvenile cohorts (p = 0.047). Substantia nigra a-syn showed no significant differences (p > 0.22); serum a-syn differed in young adults (p = 0.039), with reduced levels in the recovery group (p = 0.047). Histology revealed paraquat-induced neuronal degeneration which was most severe in adults, and partial structural restoration after recovery period. Conclusion Paraquat induces mild, age-dependent neurotoxic effects, with adults showing the greatest vulnerability. Differential serum a-syn responses and histological findings highlight developmental stage as a key modulator of susceptibility and recovery following environmental neurotoxin exposure.",

    "content": "Fairness and trust are core components of social decision making, yet little is known about how individual differences shape neural responses across these contexts. Because the Trust Game (TG) and Ultimatum Game (UG) involve different forms of norm violation, betrayal and interpersonal unfairness, they allow us to test whether neural responses generalize across social contexts Using fMRI during both the TG and UG, we examined how trait-level social cognition interacts with brain systems supporting norm evaluation. Participants demonstrated robust sensitivity to fairness in the Ultimatum Game. A whole-brain psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that connectivity between the posterior temporoparietal junction (pTPJ) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during unfair offers from a human partner was moderated by the interaction between Autism Quotient (AQ) scores and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) response to betrayal in the Trust Game. Individuals with higher AQ showed distinct patterns of pTPJ-dlPFC coupling depending on their neural sensitivity to trust violations. These findings highlight a cross-task mechanism through which trait-level social cognition and trust related conflict signals shape network-level responses to interpersonal unfairness.",

    "title": "Harmonized Protocol for Segmentation of the Hippocampal Tail on High-Resolution in vivo MRI from the Hippocampal Subfields Group (HSG)",
    "content": "The hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with cytoarchitectonically distinct subfields that exhibit heterogeneous lifespan trajectories and are differentially susceptible to diseases. Advances in high-resolution imaging have accelerated research on these structures, yet variability in segmentation protocols limits cross-study comparability. The Hippocampal Subfields Group (HSG) is an international consortium addressing this challenge by developing a reliable, accessible, and freely available segmentation protocol for high-resolution T2-weighted 3 tesla MRI scans (http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com). Here, we present the harmonized protocol for the posterior portion of the hippocampus (the 'tail'), complementing the previously established 'body' protocol, and with an anterior 'head' protocol under development. The tail protocol provides standardized definitions of the external boundaries for the posterior-most extent of the hippocampus, facilitating consistent segmentation from surrounding tissues. The research community was extensively involved through an online survey that incorporated comprehensive protocol details, feasibility assessments, tutorial videos, and illustrative segmentations. Through this collaborative process, consensus emerged to exclude subfield labeling in the hippocampal tail due to limited visibility of internal landmarks and substantial anatomical variability in this region. All proposed boundary guidelines were deemed clear and agreed upon via a Delphi procedure. The harmonized tail protocol has high intra- (Averaged ICC(2,1) > 0.98; Averaged Dice Similarity Coefficient = 0.92) and inter-rater reliability (Averaged ICC(2,k) > 0.98; Averaged Dice Similarity Coefficient = 0.86) and offers a practical framework for replicable segmentation. By establishing standardized guidelines, this protocol enhances comparability of findings across developmental, aging, and clinical research and is compatible with ongoing technological advances.",

    "title": "Unveiling the Multifaceted Networks of the Left DLPFC for Precision TMS Targeting",
    "content": "The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) is the standard target for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to ameliorate treatment-resistant depression (TRD), yet non-response rates remain high. TMS efficacy has been linked to the stimulation site's functional connectivity, particularly its anti-correlation with the subgenual cingulate cortex (SGC). While this pragmatic strategy has demonstrated clinical utility, it offers limited insight into how the lDLPFC's network interactions contribute to site-dependent variability in treatment response. Here, we used connectivity-based parcellation within an lDLPFC region encompassing common TMS targets and adjacent areas to delineate functional subdivisions and characterize their connectivity to large-scale networks and behavioral associations. Our results revealed a hierarchical organization: a coarse two-pole antagonism between anterior-central and superior-posterior subregions and a finer nine-cluster architecture exposing lDLPFC's heterogeneity along anterior-posterior and ventral-dorsal axes. Anterior-central areas were strongly anti-correlated with SGC and default-mode network, positively connected with salience, dorsal attention, and control networks, and associated with cognitive control. In contrast, superior-posterior subregions displayed the inverse pattern, while ventral clusters engaged somatomotor and visual networks, and language-related processes. Central and superior-anterior clusters showed differentiated profiles, including associations with inhibition, social cognition, and perceptual functions. To aid clinical translation, we derived an lDLPFC likelihood map integrating granularities, highlighting anterior-central lDLPFC as the strongest TMS candidate considering the relevance of its connectivity and behavioral profiles to depression, while indicating that neighboring subregions have distinct functions. These findings underscore the lDLPFC's hierarchical and heterogeneous organization and provide a network-informed reference for developing individualized, symptom-specific TMS interventions.",

    "title": "Impact of the pulse artifact on evoked activity in human wakefulness and sleep",
    "content": "The investigation of the neural evoked response to the heartbeat quantified using electroencephalography (i.e., heartbeat evoked potentials or HEPs), has gained recent attention in neuroscience, notably as a measure of interoception, the sensory system responding to internal bodily states. One main challenge in measuring HEPs is their susceptibility to cardiac artifacts contamination, including the cardiac field artifact and the pulse artifact (PA), the latter possibly caused by the mechanical pressure of pulsating vessels. Here, we aimed at assessing the impact of PAs on HEPs and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs, a proxy of the neural responses to exteroceptive sensory stimuli). To this aim, we compared two pre-processing pipelines using independent component analysis in healthy volunteers (N=30). The first, standard, pipeline excluded ocular, muscle, sweating-related activity and cardiac-related activity stemming from the cardiac field artifact. The second, pairwise phase consistency (PPC) pipeline, in addition to the removal of the aforementioned components, used the quantitative metric of PPC between independent components and the ECG to remove the cardiac-related PA. We tested how these two pre-processing approaches influenced HEPs and AEPs recorded under diverse neurophysiological conditions (wakefulness, N2, N3, and REM sleep). Comparing the HEPs from the standard and the PPC approaches (cluster-based permutation statistics, p<0.05, two-tailed) revealed a significant effect of PAs, particularly in wakefulness, followed by REM and N2 sleep, with Cohen's d effect sizes of 1.92, 0.95 and 0.88, respectively. By contrast, PA correction had a negligible effect (p>0.05, two-tailed) on the HEPs in N3 sleep and on the AEPs in all vigilance states. Our results emphasize the need to account for the PA as a significant confounding factor when comparing HEPs across groups with varying vascular or cardiac conditions.",

    "title": "MExConn: A Mechanistically Interpretable Multi-Expert Framework for Multi-Organelle Segmentation in Connectomics",
    "content": "Electron microscopy (EM) provides subcellular resolution which has made it a critical tool in fields such as cellular biology and connectomics. However, manual annotation of subcellular organelles in these EM images is extremely labor-intensive and impractical at scale. While computational segmentation methods have been developed, most existing approaches are limited to segmenting a single organelle at a time, neglecting the inherent shared information present in EM images containing multiple organelles. To address this, we present MExConn, the first known interpretable multi-expert U-Net architecture in the connectomics field that employs a shared encoder and multiple decoder heads to simultaneously segment multiple organelles from the same input EM image. MExConn significantly outperforms five baselines, including single-organelle model and four state of-the-art connectomics segmentation models in all evaluation metrics, reducing the Variation of Information by up to 33.54% on average across organelles. A key novelty of our approach is that MExConn offers mechanistic interpretability by revealing that the shared encoder learns shared representations essential for accurately segmenting multiple organelles. Through systematic analysis of encoder gradients with respect to each decoder output, we identify channel-wise importance profiles and reveal that many encoder channels are jointly essential for all organelles, while others are organelle-specific. Rigorous experiments on three connectomics datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MExConn in both segmentation performance and interpretability, establishing it as a principled approach for multi-organelle analysis in connectomics.

    "title": "Independent Filter Analysis for Group Discrimination in fMRI",
    "content": "Traditional group-level fMRI analysis approaches, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), often rely on unsupervised dimensionality reduction to map subjects into a common feature space. While effective for capturing common variance across all subjects, the preservation of discriminative features between groups of participants is not guaranteed. To address this limitation, we introduce Independent Filter Analysis (IFA), a supervised extension of group ICA that explicitly models group-discriminative information as part of the dimensionality reduction steps. Prior to unmixing, IFA constructs a subspace that simultaneously retains both shared and group-specific information, enhancing sensitivity to group effects while preserving biological interpretability. We validated IFA using simulated data and paired condition comparisons from three Human Connectome Project (HCP) tasks. In the simulation, IFA achieved 95% classification accuracy, outperforming group ICA, which failed to detect subtle group differences. On the HCP data, IFA increased network matrix classification accuracy by up to 15% and produced spatial maps that more precisely reflected task-relevant differences.",

The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an essential role in the central nervous system diseases, one of the ways in which gut microbiota affects brain is via producing metabolites. Indole-3-proprionic acid (IPA), a tryptophan-derived metabolite that mainly produced by Clostridium sporogenes, exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, its effect on ICH remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the IPA level after ICH and the therapeutic effects of IPA on neurological deficits and WMI, as well as the potential mechanisms underlying IPA-mediated neuroprotection. Methods: An ICH model was established using C57BL/6 mice, which then received intragastric IPA (20 mg/kg/day). Fecal abundance of IPA-related genes and IPA levels in feces and plasma were measured by qPCR and UPLC-MS/MS. Behavioral tests, qPCR, and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess neurological function, myelin integrity, and axonal injury. In vitro, BV2 microglia, with or without Stap1 knockdown, were co-cultured with myelin debris to assess IPA?s effects on phagocytosis. Additionally, targeted plasma IPA profiling was performed in 30 ICH patients and 30 matched healthy controls. Results: The relative abundance of IPA production-related genes and IPA levels in feces and plasma were significantly decreased after ICH and remained low into the chronical phase. After IPA administration, the neurological deficits, myelin loss and axonal injury of mice with ICH were significantly improved. In vitro, IPA increased BV2 microglia myelin debris phagocytosis by inhibiting Stap1 expression. IPA levels were significantly reduced in ICH patients, consistent with ICH mouse model. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that the gut microbiota-derived metabolite IPA could facilitate neurological deficits recovery and alleviate WMI, which could be a promising therapeutic strategy to improve ICH prognosis.",

    "content": "Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is an emerging neuromodulation technique demonstrating promise in emotional regulation. This study investigated the acute effects of both electrical (E-taVNS) and ultrasound (U-taVNS) modalities on emotional bias using a facial emotion categorization task in healthy young adults. Fifty-nine participants underwent a single-blind, sham-controlled, within-subject design, with emotional bias assessed at pre-, during-, and post-stimulation phases. Our findings revealed that both E-taVNS and U-taVNS significantly enhanced emotional bias scores, shifting the perception of neutral and ambiguous faces towards positive interpretations and reducing negative emotional bias. No significant differences in efficacy were observed between the two stimulation modalities. Furthermore, individual differences in interoceptive awareness were found to be associated with the observed taVNS effects. These results suggest that both electrical and ultrasound taVNS can acutely modulate emotional regulation, highlighting the potential of taVNS as a non-invasive, well-tolerated alternative for interventions targeting emotional bias and mood disorders.",

    "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "<p>Hello world, this is Abhay from Poly (<a href=\"https://poly.app\">https://poly.app</a>). We\u2019re building an app to replace Finder/File Explorer with something more intelligent and searchable. Think of it like Dropbox + NotebookLM + Perplexity for terabytes of your files. Here\u2019s a quick demo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsqCySU4Ln0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsqCySU4Ln0</a>.<p>Poly can search your content in natural language, across a broad range of file types and down to the page, paragraph, pixel, or point in time. We also provide an integrated agent that can take actions on your files such as creating, editing, summarizing, and researching. Any action that you can take, the agent can also take, from renaming, moving, tagging, annotating, and organizing files for you. The agent can also read URLs, youtube links, and can search the web and even download files for you.<p>Here are some public drives that you can poke around in (note: it doesn\u2019t work in Safari yet\u2014sorry! we\u2019re working on it.)<p><i>Every issue of the Whole Earth Catalogue</i>: <a href=\"https://poly.app/shared/whole-earth-catalogues\">https://poly.app/shared/whole-earth-catalogues</a><p><i>Archive of old Playstation Manuals</i>: <a href=\"https://poly.app/shared/playstation-manuals-archive\">https://poly.app/shared/playstation-manuals-archive</a><p><i>Mini archive of Orson Welles interviews and commercial spots</i>: <a href=\"https://poly.app/shared/orson-welles-archive\">https://poly.app/shared/orson-welles-archive</a><p><i>Archive of Salvador Dali\u2019s paintings for Alice in Wonderland</i>: <a href=\"https://poly.app/shared/salvador-dali-alice-in-wonderland\">https://poly.app/shared/salvador-dali-alice-in-wonderland</a><p>To try it out, navigate to one of these public folders and use the agent or search to find things. The demo video above can give you an idea of how the UI roughly works. Select files by clicking on them. Quick view by pressing space. Open the details for any file by pressing cmd + i. You can search from the top middle bar (or press cmd + K), and all searches will use semantic similarity and search within the files. Or use the agent from the bottom right tools menu (or press cmd + ?) and you can ask about the files, have the agent search for you, summarize things, etc.<p>We decided to build this after launching an early image-gen company back in March 2022, and realizing how painful it was for users to store, manage, and search their libraries, especially in a world of generative media. Despite our service having over 150,000 users at that point, we realized that our true calling was fixing the file browser to make it intelligent, so we shut our service down in 2023 and pivoted to this.<p>We think Poly will be a great fit for anyone that wants to do useful things with their files, such as summarizing research papers, finding the right media or asset, creating a shareable portfolio, searching for a particular form or document, and producing reports and overviews. Of course, it\u2019s a great way to organize your genAI assets as well. Or just use it to organize notes, links, inspo, etc.<p>Under the hood, Poly is built on our advanced search model, Polyembed-v1 that natively supports multimodal search across text, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, audio, video, PDFs, and more. We allow you to search by phrase, file similarity, color, face, and several other kinds of features. The agent is particularly skilled at using the search, so you can type in something like \u201cfind me the last lease agreement I signed\u201d and it can go look for it by searching, reading the first few files, searching again if nothing matches, etc. But the quality of our embed model means it almost always finds the file in the first search.<p>It works identically across web and desktop, except on desktop it syncs your cloud files to a folder (just like google drive). On the web we use clever caching to enable offline support and file conflict recovery. We\u2019ve taken great pains to make our system faster than your existing file browser, even if you\u2019re using it from a web browser.<p>File storage plans are currently at: 100GB free tier, paid tier is 2TB at $10/m, and 1c per GB per month on top of the 2TB. We also have rate limits for agent use that vary at different tiers.<p>We\u2019re excited to expand with many features over the following months, including \u201cvirtual files\u201d (store your google docs in Poly), sync from other hosting providers, mobile apps, an MCP ecosystem for the agent, access to web search and deep research modes, offline search, local file support (on desktop), third-party sources (WebDAV, NAS), and a whole lot more.<p>Our waitlist is now open and we\u2019ll be letting folks in starting today! Sign up at <a href=\"https://poly.app\">https://poly.app</a>.<p>We\u2019d also love to hear your thoughts (and concerns) about what we\u2019re building, as we\u2019re early in this journey so your feedback can very much shape the future of our company!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45995394\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45995394</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "title": "COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ACTING TOGETHER: A NON-HUMAN PRIMATE MODEL OF COOPERATIVE DECISION-MAKING",
    "content": "Cooperation is a crucial aspect of social behavior, allowing individuals to achieve goals unattainable alone. However, collective actions require costly inter-individual coordination, making continuous cost-benefit evaluation essential before engaging in cooperation. Non-human primate models can help uncover the evolutionary foundations of human cooperation and its underlying neural mechanisms. To this aim, we developed a novel paradigm to analyze the dyadic behavior of two macaques, who took turns in choosing between individual and cooperative actions to obtain variable rewards. Each monkey used a joystick to guide a cursor toward one of two targets, each indicating both the reward magnitude and the action type (i.e. 'solo action' or 'joint action') required to obtain their payoff. We first observed a linear improvement in dyadic performance with the expected reward magnitude. Although macaques tended to prefer individual actions, they selected to act jointly under favorable payoff conditions, indicating that voluntary cooperation in macaques can emerge as a reward-driven process. Logistic models of their choices revealed the subjective cost monkeys assigned to cooperation, which was consistent across subjects. Nonetheless, the gain rate across different sessions increased over time, suggesting that macaques possess the cognitive ability to optimize their dyadic strategies, by estimating not only the coordination costs but also the benefits of cooperation. We observed a progressive reduction in the subjective cost assigned to joint action, which was not directly dependent on performance improvements. Our findings suggest that non-human primates can weigh the costs and benefits of cooperation, highlighting their ability to dynamically adjust social strategies based on reward contingencies.",

    "title": "Adult Drosophila aversion to caffeine requires a unique TrpA1 isoform and the PLC signaling cascade",
    "content": "Taste in Drosophila melanogaster is crucial to survival, influencing feeding, mating, and egg laying behaviors. Taste organs are located on various parts of the body, including the legs, proboscis, wings, and ovipositor. Taste neurons detect chemicals via receptors like GRs, IRs, and TRPs, with bitter and sweet tastes linked to specific neurons (Gr66a+ and Gr5a+). Bitter substances such as caffeine activate neurons, resulting in rejection behavior. TrpA1 channels, associated with aversive responses, are involved in complex behaviors and could interact with taste receptors. Our results show that caffeine mixed with sucrose reduces proboscis extension in flies compared to sucrose alone, a response that requires only the TrpA1-E isoform out of the five possible ones. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that this avoidance requires TrpA1 and signaling via PLC and IP3-receptors in adult Gr66a+ neurons.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe bidirectional communication between the brain and gut in Crohn\u2019s disease is increasingly acknowledged, highlighting how gut inflammation can influence brain function and psychological health, and vice versa, through the gut-brain axis. The insula is critical for processing pain, its emotional evaluation, and for regulating neurometabolites involved in these processes. The role of insular neurometabolites in gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly pain, in Crohn\u2019s disease patients, however, is not well-understood, highlighting the need for further investigation. Therefore, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the connection between Crohn\u2019s disease and brain function by investigating neurometabolic profiles in the insula of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease.MethodsIn this study, 7 Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was utilized to examine the left insular cortex in 14 individuals with Crohn\u2019s disease and 14 age- and gender-matched healthy controls during resting state. Participants also completed neuropsychological evaluations, including the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS).ResultsNo significant differences were found in the absolute concentrations of insular neurometabolites between Crohn\u2019s disease patients and healthy controls. However, in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, GSRS scores were negatively correlated with the neurometabolites aspartate (Asp) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) in the insula. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between scores on the PCS magnification subscale and concentrations of neurometabolites\u2014namely glutamine (Gln) and the combined glutamate and glutamine signal (Glx) \u2014as measured by (1H-MRS).ConclusionThe neurometabolic alterations observed in the insular cortex of Crohn\u2019s disease patients suggest increased insular activity, which may enhance interoceptive awareness and pain sensitivity, potentially contributing to heightened pain catastrophizing.",

    "content": "The FET protein family comprises the highly conserved RNA-binding proteins FUS, EWS and TAF15 which are implicated in RNA metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTLD. Despite their structural similarity, reliable detection of individual FET proteins remains challenging due to antibody cross-reactivity and inconsistent localisation patterns reported in the literature. To address this, we systematically evaluated 23 commercially available antibodies for specificity and performance across western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Using single and double shRNA knockdowns in HeLa cells, we confirmed target engagement and identified antibodies which were specific as well as those with significant cross-reactivity. Immunofluorescence in rat primary neurons and HeLa cells showed antibody and cell type dependent variations in nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation; from these, we identified a subset that demonstrated high-quality, region-specific staining in postmortem human brain tissue. Our findings highlight substantial variability in antibody performance and underscore the need for rigorous validation to ensure reproducibility in FET protein research. We present a validated panel of antibodies suitable for diverse applications, providing a critical resource for studies of FET protein biology and pathology.",

    "title": "Longitudinal Exploration of Auditory Sensory-Perceptual Processing in CLN3 Disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten disease)): A High-Density Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) Study.",
    "content": "Background: There is currently limited information about sensory and perceptual abilities across the progression of CLN3 disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis; Batten disease), a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder and a leading cause of childhood neurodegeneration. Clinical symptoms include vision loss, motor impairments, and cognitive challenges, making it difficult to accurately assess neurocognitive and perceptual abilities. Thus, there is a critical need to identify objective biomarkers that can be used to inform disease progression and track treatment response in this population. Methods: This exploratory study investigates longitudinal changes in auditory sensory perceptual processing in a small sample of individuals with genetically confirmed CLN3 disease (N=4; 3 male) compared to a cross-sectional sample of 60 neurotypical (NT) controls using high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We utilized a duration mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm, identical to what has been used in our previous cross-sectional study. We examined the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) of the standard tones across three different stimulus onset asynchrony conditions and examined the N1 and P2 components of the AEP. Results: We found age related differences in the amplitudes of the N1 and P2 components in individuals with CLN3 disease relative to NT controls. These amplitude differences were most notable in CLN3 disease when participants were presented with standard tones that had the slowest presentation rate. Specifically, N1 and P2 amplitudes were more negative than NT controls in childhood and adolescence and as CLN3 disease participants aged, the amplitude of the AEPs was greater than controls. Further, a more positive N1 amplitude during the longest stimulus presentation condition was associated with both reduced verbal intelligence and working memory abilities in CLN3 disease participants. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings parallel recently published work in a mouse model of CLN3 disease that showed both sex- and age-dependent disruptions in central auditory processing. Taken together, we demonstrate the utility of auditory EEG measures as a sensitive, objective and translational measure in CLN3 disease that may serve as a potential outcome measure useful in tracking disease progression. Continued work is needed in humans focused on sex-based differences and longitudinal changes of auditory processing in CLN3 disease.",

    "content": "Overview: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) provide a non-invasive treatment option for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. While optimization of electrode placement is important to increase treatment efficacy, clinical therapy planning is done using an undisclosed and proprietary software (NovoTAL), which is clinically unvalidated. This study investigates a new computational approach for optimizing TTFields electrode placement and is compared to the current clinical standard. Methods: We developed a new computational pipeline integrating patient-specific anatomical data to optimize electrode configurations in five representative glioblastoma cases with diverse tumor locations and sizes. Two optimization strategies were employed: one maximizing electric field intensity at the tumor, and another enhancing coverage of the adjacent brain while maintaining sufficient tumor intensity. Results were compared to electrode placements generated by NovoTAL. Additional simulations with artificial tumors assessed the effects of tumor size and location. Results: Optimized electrode placements improved electric field intensity in tumors by 18%-34% compared to the clinical standard. Coverage-weighted optimizations provided broader field coverage without significantly compromising tumor intensity. Smaller or surface-adjacent tumors benefited most from optimization, achieving precise targeting and enhanced coverage. Extensive randomized placement analyses highlighted the superior performance of the optimized configurations. Analysis of artificial models showed consistent improvements across varying tumor locations and sizes. Conclusion: Personalized optimization of TTFields electrode placement significantly improves electric field targeting of tumors and adjacent brain regions. This approach outperforms standardized planning software and clinical practices and supports future development of adaptive, automated strategies for individualized TTFields therapy in glioblastoma.",

    "title": "A 4-pole Theory-Based Compensation Method using Multiple Loads for Impedance Spectroscopy of Porcine Brain Tissue",
    "content": "Accurate determination of the electrical properties of brain tissue -conductivity and relative permittivity - is essential for modeling and optimizing neurostimulation and neuroimaging and modulation techniques such as EEG, MEG, TMS, and TES. However, large discrepancies in reported conductivity values highlight the methodological challenges associated with impedance measurements. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of compensation methods in impedance spectroscopy to improve measurement accuracy using a self-developed four-point platinum electrode designed for biological tissue applications. Three compensation algorithms - open-short, open-short-load, and multiple-load - were implemented and compared using an RC parallel test circuit that emulated typical measurement conditions, with load resistances ranging from 250 Ohm to 5000 Ohm. Quantitative error analysis demonstrated that the multiple-load method achieved the lowest normalized root mean square error (3.4%) and superior stability across frequencies from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. The calibrated probe was subsequently applied to post mortem porcine brain tissue, yielding conductivity values of grey matter of 0.109 S/m and white matter of 0.074 S/m. These results are significantly lower than standard simulation parameters of 0.275 S/m, and 0.126 S/m for grey and white matter, respectively. Finite-element simulations revealed that using the measured conductivities increased electric field predictions by 2.1% for TMS and 46% for TES in the maximum electric field magnitude, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that accurate impedance compensation is critical for reliable characterization of brain tissue and for enhancing the precision of neurostimulation modeling in the future.",

    "title": "Silmitasertib, an FDA-designated orphan CK2 Inhibitor, ameliorates neuropathology and motor dysfunction in a Huntington's disease mouse model",
    "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that manifests with progressive motor, cognitive, and psychological impairments. HD is caused by a polyQ (CAG) repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, leading to the misfolding and aggregation of mutant HTT protein (mHTT) and the preferential degeneration of the striatum. Previously in our lab, we identified Protein Kinase CK2 as an important kinase involved in the pathophysiology of HD. Specifically, the alpha prime catalytic subunit of CK2 (CK2') is upregulated in HD, and genetic depletion of CK2' in HD mice results in improved motor behavior, decreased mutant Htt aggregation, and improved neuronal function. Silmitasertib (CX-4945) is an FDA designated orphan drug that inhibits CK2. This study aims to investigate whether CX-4945 treatment ameliorates HD pathology. We treated prodromal and late symptomatic HD mice, and used a variety of immunohistochemical, biochemical, physiological and behavioral approaches. We found that CX-4945 presented benefits in the amelioration of HD pathophysiology in both treated groups. Importantly, we found CX-4945 decreased mHtt aggregation, increased DARPP-32 expression and excitatory synapse density, restored homeostatic astrocyte phenotypes and ameliorated neuroinflammation and microgliosis, altogether resulting in improved motor behavior. These results support CX-4945 as a strong candidate for a targeted therapy to treat HD.",

    "title": "Comparing Methods for Mass Univariate Analyses of Human EEG: Empirical Data and Simulations",
    "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used method for investigating human brain dynamics. However, EEG analyses are frequently conducted with limited a priori knowledge regarding locations or latencies of meaningful statistical effects. This makes it difficult for researchers to form regions of interest (ROIs), which are then analyzed using traditional statistical models such as analysis of variance. In addition, exploratory studies, or studies interested in determining the exact temporal and spatial extent of a predicted effect may aim to examine many sensor locations and time points, often jointly. To address this, mass univariate analyses have become a valuable complement to ROI-based approaches. These methods attempt to correct for multiple comparisons while mitigating the risk of false positives and false negatives, thus enabling statistical inference in high-dimensional EEG data. Here, we review and evaluate different approaches for delineating spatial and temporal effect boundaries in three different datasets, focusing on within-subjects comparisons. Specifically, we focus on permutation-based approaches and their Bayesian alternatives to address condition differences in i) steady-state evoked responses, ii) event-related potentials, and iii) time-frequency data. Overall, simulation results indicate that cluster-based permutation tests provide a relatively liberal approach to correct for multiple comparisons across domains, with high sensitivity for detecting large effects. In contrast, the permutation-based tmax procedure yields the most conservative method across datasets. Bayesian approaches inherently are continuous in nature and thus strongly depend on the selection of thresholds for when support for a hypothesis is considered meaningful.",

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "title": "N6-methyladenosine RNA methylation is a novel epitranscriptomic regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and vulnerability to relapse",
    "content": "While internal RNA modifications have been known for decades, the contribution of epitranscriptomics to alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains unexplored. Here we investigated, for the first time, the role of the most abundant mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of alcohol drinking and alcohol mediated gene expression. The fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) plays a key role in erasing m6A RNA methylation marks. We generated brain m6A hypermethylated mice with selective deletion of FTO in neurons by crossing FTO-floxed mice (FTO-fl/fl) with the synapsin-1-CRE deleter line (Syn1-CRE). Neuronal FTO-deficient mice showed enhanced initial motivation for alcohol, achieved escalated (dependent) drinking more rapidly after repeated cycles of alcohol intoxication and were more susceptible to relapse to heavy drinking following a period of abstinence. Alcohol-naive neuronal FTO-deficient mice exhibited potentiated alcohol-induced anxiolytic and sedative effects and blunted anxiogenic responses, despite unaltered alcohol metabolism. We carried out RNA-Seq of enriched methylated RNA by immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and RNA-Seq profiling of unenriched RNA to study alcohols effect on the epitranscriptomic and transcriptional landscape. We observed that a history of alcohol intoxication induces robust RNA m6A hypermethylation in the hippocampus and that FTO-deficiency markedly alters m6A methylation and transcriptional dynamics. GSEA pathway analysis showed that neuronal FTO deficiency induces addiction-relevant pathways and alters monoaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, providing a molecular basis for the heightened vulnerability to alcohol abuse. Our findings demonstrate that neuronal m6A RNA methylation is a novel regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and alcohol-dependent gene expression and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis AUD.",

    "title": "Rapid neocortical network modifications via dendritic plateau potential induced plasticity",
    "content": "Learning in brains is associated with changes in neuronal network activity thought to be driven by synaptic plasticity. While recent work in the hippocampus has revealed some of the mechanisms involved there, less is known about how neocortical circuits adapt, especially during behavior. Here to determine if neocortical areas possess rapid plasticity mechanisms that could support online adaptations we used optical imaging and intracellular membrane potential (Vm) recordings to examine the activity of layer V neurons in a higher visual area of mice learning a task. The introduction of a novel rewarded stimulus resulted in a rapid modification of population activity that featured abrupt alterations in single neuron selectivity. Vm recordings revealed that both naturally occurring and experimentally-induced dendritic calcium plateau potentials (plateaus) rapidly alter the action potential (APs) output and Vm dynamics of neurons over many seconds of time around the plateau, in some cases from one trial to the next. Trains of high frequency APs had no effect. Finally, experimental inhibition during learning of the distal dendritic region responsible for initiating plateaus reduced the rate of population level adaptation. Our findings suggest that the deep layers of higher order visual cortex possess a rapid learning mechanism mediated by plateau-induced synaptic plasticity.",

    "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis drives stroke-associated pneumonia: mechanisms and targeted therapeutic strategies",
    "content": "The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a central regulator of immune function, with growing research highlighting its association with the development of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP). This review provides an overview of current research on the correlation between SAP and alterations in gut microbial composition and metabolism, with a focus on microbial imbalance, changes in key metabolites, and relevant biological mechanisms. Clinical and preclinical studies consistently report a decline in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, an increase in potentially harmful microbial species, reduced SCFAs levels, and elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. These disturbances appear to be associated with SAP progression through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain and microbiota\u2013gut\u2013lung axes by affecting immune regulation and inflammatory responses. The review also examines microbiota-targeted treatment approaches, including dietary modification, antibiotic therapy, probiotics, microbiota-regulating compounds, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and respiratory microbiota transfer. A deeper understanding of how microbial disturbances are correlated with SAP may help explain the increased vulnerability to pulmonary infections following stroke and support the design of more effective, microbiota-based therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "Reversible splenial lesion syndrome associated with Graves\u2019 disease and hepatic dysfunction: a case report",
    "content": "BackgroundReversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) has been confirmed to induce severe psychiatric symptoms. This syndrome is a rare clinical condition with an etiology that remains unclear. According to current literature, the primary cause of RESLES may be associated with cytotoxic cerebral edema. First reported in 1999, reversible splenial syndrome may be triggered by bacterial or viral infections, epileptic seizures, metabolic disorders, hyperosmolar cerebral edema, and other factors. In this study, we report the case of RESLES in a patient with Graves\u2019 disease and liver dysfunction.Case presentationThe patient was a 17-year-old female adolescent with persistent headaches, dizziness, and nausea with vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested RESLES as the diagnosis. On admission, the patient presented with elevated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and positive thyroid-receptor antibodies (TRAb), meeting the diagnostic criteria for Graves\u2019 disease. Concurrently, the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also elevated. After hormone therapy, the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved, and imaging results returned to normal.ConclusionThis study presents a case of a patient with RESLES characterized by Graves\u2019 disease and liver function abnormalities, who was sensitive to anti-thyroid drug (methimazole) and hormone therapy (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) and had a favorable prognosis. This study contributed to expanding the clinical understanding of RESLES and suggests that, in clinical practice, autoimmune hyperthyroidism may be a novel trigger for RESLES, while concurrent liver dysfunction in this context requires further investigation.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo describe two cases of recurrent, delayed-onset severe neutropenia several months following ocrelizumab therapy in patients with relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).BackgroundA rare adverse effect of ocrelizumab is neutropenia, with late-onset neutropenia (LON) occurring more rarely. Literature guiding management of transient recurrent neutropenia in the setting of anti-CD20 therapy is lacking.MethodsCase 1: 38-year-old female emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Two years later, she developed severe symptomatic LON and required antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). Ocrelizumab was held, patient switched to ozanimod, but neutropenia recurred. Due to concerns of MS progression, ocrelizumab was restarted after the patient transitioned to a telehealth setting, with no recurrence of neutropenia at one-year follow-up. Case 2: 35-year-old male emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Ocrelizumab was resumed after absolute neutrophil count recovery. Two years later, he developed moderate symptomatic LON during a suspected viral illness. Ocrevus was discontinued at this point. A subsequent episode occurred 3\u202fmonths later during confirmed rhinovirus infection, again resolving promptly.ConclusionThese cases highlight the unpredictable nature of recurrent LON with ocrelizumab and suggest the possibility of immune-mediated marrow suppression, potentially unmasked or worsened by infections, rather than direct drug toxicity, highlighting the need for clearer management guidelines.",

    "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.15352v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People increasingly seek personal advice from large language models (LLMs), yet whether humans follow their advice, and its consequences for their well-being, remains unknown. In a longitudinal randomised controlled trial with a representative UK sample (N = 2,302), 75% of participants who had a 20-minute discussion with GPT-4o about health, careers or relationships subsequently reported following its advice. Based on autograder evaluations of chat transcripts, LLM advice rarely violated safety best practice. When queried 2-3 weeks later, participants who had interacted with personalised AI (with access to detailed user information) followed its advice more often in the real world and reported higher well-being than those advised by non-personalised AI. However, while receiving personal advice from AI temporarily reduced well-being, no differential long-term effects compared to a control emerged. Our results suggest that humans readily follow LLM advice about personal issues but doing so shows no additional well-being benefit over casual conversations.",

    "title": "Reflexive Evidence-Based Multimodal Learning for Clean Energy Transitions: Causal Insights on Cooking Fuel Access, Urbanization, and Carbon Emissions",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.15342v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) requires not only technological innovation but also a deeper understanding of the socioeconomic factors influencing energy access and carbon emissions. While these factors are gaining attention, critical questions remain, particularly regarding how to quantify their impacts on energy systems, model their cross-domain interactions, and capture feedback dynamics in the broader context of energy transitions. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClimateAgents, an AI-based framework that combines large language models with domain-specialized agents to support hypothesis generation and scenario exploration. Leveraging 20 years of socioeconomic and emissions data from 265 economies, countries and regions, and 98 indicators drawn from the World Bank database, the framework applies a machine learning based causal inference approach to identify key determinants of carbon emissions in an evidence-based, data driven manner. The analysis highlights three primary drivers: access to clean cooking fuels in rural areas, access to clean cooking fuels in urban areas, and the percentage of population living in urban areas. These findings underscore the critical role of clean cooking technologies and urbanization patterns in shaping emission outcomes. In line with growing calls for evidence-based AI policy, ClimateAgents offers a modular and reflexive learning system that supports the generation of credible and actionable insights for policy. By integrating heterogeneous data modalities, including structured indicators, policy documents, and semantic reasoning, the framework contributes to adaptive policymaking infrastructures that can evolve with complex socio-technical challenges. This approach aims to support a shift from siloed modeling to reflexive, modular systems designed for dynamic, context-aware climate action.",

This mismatch creates a cognitive gap, limiting designers' ability to articulate evolving intentions, critically evaluate outputs, and maintain creative agency. To address these challenges, we developed DesignerlyLoop, a visual node-based system that embeds LLM reasoning chains into the design workflow. The system enables designers to externalize and curate reasoning structures, iteratively organize intentions, and interact with LLMs as dynamic cognitive engines rather than static answer providers. We conducted a within-subject study with 20 designers, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, and found that DesignerlyLoop enhanced creative reflection, design quality, and interaction experience by supporting systematic engagement with both human and machine reasoning. These findings highlight the potential of structured, interactive visualization to transform human-AI co-creation into a reflective and iterative design process.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.15253v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective presentation skills are essential in education, professional communication, and public speaking, yet learners often lack access to high-quality exemplars or personalized coaching. Existing AI tools typically provide isolated functionalities such as speech scoring or script generation without integrating reference modeling and interactive feedback into a cohesive learning experience. We introduce a dual-agent system that supports presentation practice through two complementary roles: the Ideal Presentation Agent and the Coach Agent. The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback. Implemented on a robust backend with multi-model integration, voice cloning, and error handling mechanisms, the system demonstrates how AI-driven agents can provide engaging, human-centered, and scalable support for presentation skill development in both educational and professional contexts.",

Complex visual imagery, as proposed in our work, involves the user engaging in the mental visualization of complex upper limb movements. This innovative approach significantly enhances the BCI system, facilitating the extension of its applications to more sophisticated tasks such as EEG-based robotic arm control. By leveraging this advanced form of visual imagery, our study opens new horizons for intricate and intuitive mind-controlled interfaces. We developed an advanced deep learning architecture that integrates functional connectivity metrics with a convolutional neural network-image transformer. This framework is adept at decoding subtle user intentions, addressing the spatial variability in complex visual tasks, and effectively translating these into precise commands for robotic arm control. Our comprehensive offline and pseudo-online evaluations demonstrate the framework's efficacy in real-time applications, including the nuanced control of robotic arms. The robustness of our approach is further validated through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, marking a significant step towards versatile, subject-independent BCI applications.

    "content": "arXiv:2511.15182v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Efficient and sustainable maritime transport increasingly depends on reliable forecasting and adaptive routing, yet operational adoption remains difficult due to forecast latencies and the need for human judgment in rapid decision-making under changing ocean conditions. We introduce SWR-Viz, an AI-assisted visual analytics framework that combines a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator wave forecast model with SIMROUTE-based routing and interactive emissions analytics. The framework generates near-term forecasts directly from current conditions, supports data assimilation with sparse observations, and enables rapid exploration of what-if routing scenarios. We evaluate the forecast models and SWR-Viz framework along key shipping corridors in the Japan Coast and Gulf of Mexico, showing both improved forecast stability and realistic routing outcomes comparable to ground-truth reanalysis wave products. Expert feedback highlights the usability of SWR-Viz, its ability to isolate voyage segments with high emission reduction potential, and its value as a practical decision-support system. More broadly, this work illustrates how lightweight AI forecasting can be integrated with interactive visual analytics to support human-centered decision-making in complex geospatial and environmental domains.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.15013v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, underpinning effective learning. Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) can strengthen neural representations by re-engaging learning circuits during sleep. However, TMR protocols overlook individual differences in learning capacity and memory trace strength, limiting efficacy for difficult-to-recall memories. Here, we present a personalized TMR protocol that adjusts stimulation frequency based on individual retrieval performance and task difficulty during a word-pair memory task. In an experiment comparing personalized TMR, TMR, and control groups, the personalized protocol significantly reduced memory decay and improved error correction under challenging recall. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analyses revealed enhanced synchronization of slow waves and spindles, with a significant positive correlation between behavioral and EEG features for challenging memories. Multivariate classification identified distinct neural signatures linked to the personalized approach, highlighting its ability to target memory-specific circuits. These findings provide novel insights into sleep-dependent memory consolidation and support personalized TMR interventions to optimize learning outcomes.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.15012v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Modern lifestyles contribute to insufficient sleep, impairing cognitive function and weakening the immune system. Sleep quality (SQ) is vital for physiological and mental health, making its understanding and accurate assessment critical. However, its multifaceted nature, shaped by neurological and environmental factors, makes precise quantification challenging. Here, we address this challenge by utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) for phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis to elucidate the neurological basis of SQ, examining both states of sleep and wakefulness, including resting state (RS) and working memory. Our results revealed distinct patterns in beta power and delta connectivity in sleep and RS, together with the reaction time of working memory. A notable finding was the pronounced delta-beta PAC, a feature markedly stronger in individuals with good SQ. We further observed that SQ was positively correlated with increased delta-beta PAC. Leveraging these insights, we applied machine learning models to classify SQ at an individual level, demonstrating that the delta-beta PAC outperformed other EEG characteristics. These findings establish delta-beta PAC as a robust electrophysiological marker to quantify SQ and elucidate its neurological determinants.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.14972v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Amid the growing prevalence of human -- AI interaction, large language models and other AI-based entities increasingly provide forms of companionship to human users. Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks. This analysis offers immediate suggestions for reducing risks while laying a foundation for deeper investigation of this critical but understudied topic.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.04047v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.",

The present study elaborates on previous research surrounding a potential illusion-induced bias in penalty kicks. Participants were exposed to goalkeeper configurations within a virtual goal including arms-parallel, arms-down, arms-out and arms-up. They separately judged the perceived size of the goalkeeper, and executed penalty kicks. The perceived size was near fully consistent with the intended illusion. Meanwhile, the penalty kicks indicated wider a horizontal position following arms-out, and lower vertical position following arms-up. Likewise, there was no relation between the biases expressed in perception and action. While goalkeepers can elicit a perceptual illusion, this does not extend to influencing the penalty kick itself. Instead, other contextual cues appeared more relevant including the proximity between the goalkeeper and goalposts, and with it, the available space in the goal.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.15298v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: There is now ample evidence that Motor Imagery (MI) contributes to improve motor performance. Previous studies provided evidence that its effectiveness remains dependent upon specific guidelines and recommendations. The body posture, as well as the context in which MI is performed, are notably critical and should be carefully considered. The present study in young tennis players (n=18) was designed to compare the effectiveness of performing MI of the serve while adopting a loose grip (congruent MI) or holding tightly and squeezing hard the racket (incongruent MI). Data revealed that both MI conditions contributed to enhance the number of successful serves (p<0.001) and the technical quality of the serve (p<0.001). Interestingly, comparing mean serve accuracy scores showed that performance gains were significantly higher in the loose MI group than in the tight MI group (p<0.02). These findings confirm the critical importance of the congruence between the content of the mental representation and the features of the corresponding actual movement. Overall, the present study further highlights the effectiveness of the loose grip while mentally rehearsing the serve, and might thus contribute to update and adjust specific MI guidelines and recommendations.",

    "title": "Detection of spiking motifs of arbitrary length in neural activity using bounded synaptic delays",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.15296v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the context of spiking neural networks, temporal coding of signals is increasingly preferred over the rate coding hypothesis due to its advantages in processing speed and energy efficiency. In temporal coding, synaptic delays are crucial for processing signals with precise spike timings, known as spiking motifs. Synaptic delays are however bounded in the brain and can thus be shorter than the duration of a motif. This prevents the use of motif recognition methods that consist of setting heterogeneous delays to synchronize the input spikes on a single output neuron acting as a coincidence detector. To address this issue, we developed a method to detect motifs of arbitrary length using a sequence of output neurons connected to input neurons by bounded synaptic delays. Each output neuron is associated with a sub-motif of bounded duration. A motif is recognized if all sub-motifs are sequentially detected by the output neurons. We simulated this network using leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and tested it on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) database, that is, on audio data converted to spikes via a cochlear model, as well as on random simultaneous motifs. The results demonstrate that the network can effectively recognize motifs of arbitrary length extracted from the SHD database. Our method features a correct detection rate of about 60% in presence of ten simultaneous motifs from the SHD dataset and up to 80% for five motifs, showing the robustness of the network to noise. Results on random overlapping patterns show that the recognition of a single motif overlapping with other motifs is most effective for a large number of input neurons and sparser motifs. Our method provides a foundation for more general models for the storage and retrieval of neural information of arbitrary temporal lengths.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.14917v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Working memory requires the brain to maintain information from the recent past to guide ongoing behavior. Neurons can contribute to this capacity by slowly integrating their inputs over time, creating persistent activity that outlasts the original stimulus. However, when these slowly integrating neurons are organized hierarchically, they introduce cumulative delays that create a fundamental challenge for learning: teaching signals that indicate whether behavior was correct or incorrect arrive out-of-sync with the neural activity they are meant to instruct. Here, we demonstrate that neurons enhanced with an adaptive current can compensate for these delays by responding to external stimuli prospectively -- effectively predicting future inputs to synchronize with them. First, we show that such prospective neurons enable teaching signal synchronization across a range of learning algorithms that propagate error signals through hierarchical networks. Second, we demonstrate that this successfully guides learning in slowly integrating neurons, enabling the formation and retrieval of memories over extended timescales. We support our findings with a mathematical analysis of the prospective coding mechanism and learning experiments on motor control tasks. Together, our results reveal how neural adaptation could solve a critical timing problem and enable efficient learning in dynamic environments.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.14872v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Empirical evidence of scaling behaviors in neuronal avalanches suggests that neuronal populations in the brain operate near criticality. Departure from scaling in neuronal avalanches has been used as a measure of distance to criticality and linked to brain disorders. A distinct line of evidence for brain criticality has come from thermodynamic signatures in maximum entropy (ME) models. Both of these approaches have been widely applied to the analysis of neuronal data. However, the relationship between deviations from avalanche criticality and thermodynamics of ME models of neuronal populations remains poorly understood. To address this question, we study spontaneous activity of organotypic rat cortex slice cultures in physiological and drug-induced hypo- or hyper-excitable conditions, which are classified as critical, subcritical and supercritical based on avalanche dynamics. We find that ME models inferred from critical cultures show signatures of criticality in thermodynamic quantities, e.g. specific heat. However, such signatures are also present, and equally strong, in models inferred from supercritical cultures -- despite their altered dynamics and poor functional performance. On the contrary, ME models inferred from subcritical cultures do not show thermodynamic hints of criticality. Importantly, we confirm these results using an interpretable neural network model that can be tuned to and away from avalanche criticality. Our findings indicate that maximum entropy models correctly distinguish subcritical from critical/supercritical systems. However, they may not be able to discriminate between avalanche criticality and supercriticality, although they may still capture a number of important features from neuronal data.",

    "content": "The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is a specialized chemosensory structure in the nasal cavity that detects pheromones and mediates social and reproductive behaviors. The VNO of rodents is populated by different types of Vomeronasal Sensory Neurons (VSNs). Apical VSNs, located near the lumen, express the transcription factor (TF) Meis2, V1R family receptors, and the G protein subunit Go, the VSNs distributed closer to the basal lamina express the TF Tfap2e/AP2{epsilon}, V2R receptors, and the G protein subunit Gi2. In addition, sparse cells in the VNO express the Formyl Peptide Receptors (FPRs). Single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA Seq) identified over 980 differentially expressed genes between these cell types, with many linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Among these ER proteins, Canopy1 (Cnpy1), was found to be among the most enriched genes in V2R+ VSNs. Previously studied only in zebrafish, Cnpy1 was found to affect Fgfr1 signaling and is thus also known as FGF signaling regulator-1. In a previous study, we discovered that AP-2{epsilon} upregulates Cnpy1 expression. Although Cnpy1 knockout mice are viable and have normal VNO development at birth, they experience a progressive degeneration and loss of V2R-expressing VSNs. Prior to symptoms, the basal VSNs of KO mice display reduced V2R protein immunoreactivity in the soma and a complete absence of the protein at the lumen of the VNO, rendering the neurons non-functional. Cnpy1 KOs exhibit altered guidance cues and adhesion molecule expression, along with disrupted connectivity to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Our study shows that distinct neuronal types depend on unique ER protein repertoires to maintain proper proteostasis. The loss of Cnpy1 highlights the importance of cell type specific ER factors in the differentiation and function of specific neurons, revealing mechanisms that drive neuronal diversity and vulnerability to ER gene disruption.",

    "title": "Super-resolution microscopy and deep learning methods: what can they bring to neuroscience: from neuron to 3D spine segmentation",
    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

    "content": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease, yet strategies for safe and precise mitochondrial-targeted delivery remain limited. Here, we establish strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) as a biocompatible, high-fidelity chemical platform for engineering mitochondria-targeted brain-derived exosomes (BR-EVs). Copper-free click conjugation of a mitochondrial-targeting ligand (e.g. Cy5-DBCO) under mild aqueous conditions preserved vesicle morphology (30-150 nm core; 120-200 nm hydrodynamic), proteomic composition, and uptake dynamics. Time-course imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed unaltered endocytic kinetics, >75 % mitochondrial colocalization, and intact organelle architecture. In vivo neuroinflammation and biodistribution analyses demonstrated immunological neutrality, strong central nervous system retention, and minimal peripheral dispersion following intracerebroventricular administration. Proteomic profiling of unlabeled Sprague-Dawley (SD) and hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) BR-EVs uncovered hypertension-driven enrichment of oxidative and complement pathways correlating with mitochondrial fragmentation and reactive oxygen species generation in neuronal cultures. These findings establish SPAAC-mediated ligand conjugation as a biocompatible and chemically precise approach for generating mitochondria-targeted exosomes that preserve exosomal identity, biodistribution, and signaling fidelity-advancing a foundational platform for organelle-specific delivery and mechanistic imaging in the central nervous system.",

    "title": "Analysis of cortical dysplasias using b-tensor encoding diffusion MRI in an animal model",
    "content": "Cortical dysplasias are malformations of cortical development characterized by disorganization of the cyto- and myeloarchitecture of the neocortex. They are a common cause of epilepsy and their diagnosis through conventional imaging can often be challenging, hindering surgical treatments. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has the ability to infer tissue properties at the microscopic scale, making it a promising technique for detection of cortical dysplasias. This study aims to assess the microarchitecture of the cerebral cortex in a murine model of cortical dysplasia using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) acquired with b-tensor encoding. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered either carmustine (BCNU) or saline solution on day 15 of gestation. Their offspring were imaged at 120 days of age using a 7 tesla scanner, acquiring diffusion-sensitive images with b-tensor encoding. Images were processed with Q-space trajectory imaging with positivity constraints (QTI+) to derive various metrics along a curvilinear coordinate system across the neocortex. After scanning, the brains were processed for immunofluorescence and histological examinations. Experimental animals exhibited a significant reduction of microscopic fractional anisotropy ( FA) and anisotropic kurtosis (Ka) in the middle and lateral cortical layers compared to the control animals. Immunofluorescence and histological analysis showed decreased and dysorganized myelinated fibers, and an increase of glial processes in BCNU-treated animals. Given the applicability of b-tensor encoding in clinical scanners, this approach holds promise for improving detection of focal cortical dysplasias in patients with epilepsy.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Working on a new Python library called Code Spy that watches for file changes and automatically runs tasks to keep your code quality high.</p> <p>The project is not designed to replace enterprise level build / deployment CI infrastructure, it's a shortcut for developers working on solo projects that don't have the time to setup all their build tools and want a simple solution to get up &amp; running quickly! I built it for myself, for this very requirement &amp; just opened sourced it as maybe other solo devs might be interested.</p> <h1>What My Projects Does</h1> <p>The library currently supports four types of tasks, each designed to help with a specific part of the development workflow:</p> <p>Type Checking (MyPy) \u2013 Ensures your Python code has the correct type annotations and catches type-related errors early. This helps prevent subtle bugs and makes your code more maintainable.</p> <p>Linting (Pylint) \u2013 Analyzes your code for style, formatting, and potential issues according to configurable rules. It ensures consistency across your codebase and highlights areas for improvement.</p> <p>Testing (Pytest) \u2013 Automatically runs your test suite whenever code changes, helping you catch regressions quickly and maintain confidence in your code.</p> <p>Development Server (WSGI compatible apps) \u2013 Restarts your development server automatically when code changes are detected, making the feedback loop faster during development.</p> <p>Together, these tasks create a streamlined workflow that keeps code clean, correct, and ready for production with minimal manual effort.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Anyone developing applications that want to easily check their code quality locally in a single terminal with watching / reloading functionality. This is not designed to replace your enterprise CI build pipeline in your day job.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Running any of these tasks manually in separate terminals / saving time having set all this up yourself.</p> <p>Please \u2b50\ufe0f if you find this project interesting: <a href=\"https://github.com/joegasewicz/code-spy\">https://github.com/joegasewicz/code-spy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/joegeezer\"> /u/joegeezer </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p1nbp6/python_library_that_watches_your_code_auto_runs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p1nbp6/python_library_that_watches_your_code_auto_runs/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Rett Syndrome is a rare, x-linked genetic neurological disorder caused by MECP2 gene mutations. This progressive neurodevelopmental disorder hinders patients ability to breathe and eat normally. It is unclear how Mecp2-deficiency results in a high percentage of dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia in patients with Rett syndrome. We aim to determine the effects of Mecp2-deficiency on swallow related neuromuscular mechanisms contributing to dysphagia in Rett syndrome. Swallow and breathing were detected using electrophysiology in the submental and laryngeal muscle complexes and the hypoglossal and vagus nerves. Several medullary motoneuron populations involved in swallowing were examined by immunohistochemistry in pre and post symptomatic Mecp2-deficient male and female mice. Swallow-related submental complex duration and amplitude were significantly decreased in both Mecp2-/y and Mecp2+/- compared to wild-type, due to decreased motor unit activation. In both Mecp2-deficient mice, cholinergic staining in hypoglossal, facial, and trigeminal nuclei were decreased. We noted a significant increase in the transition time from inspiration to swallow, swallow to the subsequent inspiration, and impaired respiratory rhythm regeneration in Mecp2-/y, but not Mecp2+/- mice. Mecp2-deficiency resulted in impaired brainstem cholinergic signaling, which contribute to weakened submental muscle complex activity, and impaired swallow related laryngeal vestibular closure. These results suggest Mecp2-deficient mice are a viable pre-clinical model to further study dysphagia in Rett syndrome.",

    "content": "MatClassRSA is a MATLAB toolbox that performs magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) classification and other analyses related to Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). The toolbox is designed for cognitive neuroscience researchers who wish to perform classification-based decoding analyses of their data---often repeated trials of evoked responses---or derive Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) as input to RSA. Organized as a collection of user-called functions, MatClassRSA v2 comprises five main modules: Preprocessing, Reliability, Classification, RDM Computation, and Visualization. The Classification module supports multiple classifiers (LDA, RF, SVM) and classification schemes (e.g., multiclass, pairwise, cross-validated, train-test, hyperparameter optimization) and offers basic statistical analyses via permutation testing. Functions in other modules include, for example, trial-averaging and noise normalization; reliability estimation; non-classification RDM construction; and hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering visualizations. The toolbox is freely available on GitHub under an MIT license and includes the main codebase, a User Manual, example function calls, and illustrative analyses. This preprint provides a general background of M/EEG classification for RSA as well as a narrative overview of the v2 MatClassRSA release, its updated functionalities, and illustrative analyses performed using the toolbox.",

    "title": "GABA-glutamate corelease is a mechanism for state-dependent neurotransmission",
    "content": "Ventral tegmental area neurons projecting to lateral habenula (LHb) corelease the main inhibitory and excitatory transmitters, GABA and glutamate (VTAGG). Yet the functional role of this synchronous signal remains unclear. We hypothesized that the sign of VTAGG action depends on postsynaptic state in LHb. Ex vivo, activating VTAGG terminals evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses in LHb that varied with postsynaptic membrane potential. In vivo, VTAGG inputs drove net inhibition and supported positive reinforcement that was dependent on GABA, but not glutamate, release. Using chemogenetics to bidirectionally modulate LHb, we found that LHb hyperpolarization shifted VTAGG effects toward excitation, abolishing positive reinforcement, whereas LHb depolarization enhanced net inhibition and positive reinforcement. Thus, the activity state of LHb neurons dictates whether GABA-glutamate corelease is functionally inhibitory or excitatory and can reverse the motivational valence of VTAGG input, supporting a homeostatic role for GABA-glutamate cotransmission with broad implications for disorders of imbalanced motivation.",
