    "title": "Electroencephalography signatures of motor error and stimulus-driven attention in electrical muscle stimulation-induced wrist movements under motor imagery",
    "content": "This study examines how electroencephalography (EEG) signatures are modulated during passive movements induced by electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). Specifically, we focused on three key factors: (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions (motor imagery and waiting). We tested how error-related neural responses are modulated by the mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs during motor imagery. To this end, we introduced a wrist-movement paradigm combining motor imagery with EMS. Participants either imagined wrist dorsiflexion toward visual targets or passively waited. EMS was then applied to induce passive wrist movements. EMS intensity and presentation rate were manipulated so that the magnitude of stepwise motor error (physical deviation from the target) and stimulation-driven attention varied inversely, allowing us to evaluate their respective neural effects. Event-related potential (ERP) components at approximately 700 ms reflected graded evaluation of motor error. An ERP component at approximately 300 ms was modulated primarily by EMS intensity and presentation rate, consistent with stimulus-driven attention. Mu-band suppression reflected the match between predicted and actual sensory inputs. Theta-band enhancement in the absence of motor imagery suggested increased sensory unpredictability due to the lack of internally generated predictions, whereas beta-band activity may have been related to fluctuations in state prediction. To our knowledge, the proposed motor imagery with the EMS wrist-movement paradigm is the first to investigate how (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions shape EEG signatures during passive, electrically induced movements. Understanding how these neural signals vary with mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of error processing and sensory prediction in the human brain.",

For me, it's a nightmare to navigate and write code that way at my workplace.

    "title": "Novel devaluation methods to explore habits in humans",
    "content": "Habits in humans are commonly studied through outcome devaluation paradigms, but most existing tasks fail to capture the robustness of habitual behavior seen in animal models. I introduce two novel behavioral tasks designed to overcome these limitations. In the first task, (\"shooting aliens task\", n = 45), I simplified an existing instrumental learning task and implemented a novel intra-block reversal method in which stimulus positions changed unexpectedly within blocks while maintaining the same stimulus-action mappings. Participants also completed a classical devaluation phase with explicit reward changes. In the second task (\"hands-attack task\", n = 44), which relied on real-life avoidance behavior, devaluation was achieved by reversing reward contingencies and allowing participants to inhibit the dominant avoidance response in favor of a more effortful counterattack. Across both tasks, overtrained conditions led to more errors and longer response times after devaluation, confirming increased insensitivity to outcome change. Intra-block reversals in the shooting aliens task produced stronger habitual signatures than standard whole-block devaluation, revealing a greater cost of overriding automatic responses. In the hands-attack task, even without prior training, participants showed clear markers of habitual behavior, suggesting that real-world action patterns can replicate key features of laboratory habits. Interestingly, participants were more accurate in overriding overtrained responses when attacks were highly familiar, possibly due to enhanced perceptual processing, although this came at the cost of longer response times. These findings introduce two complementary tools that address key limitations in current paradigms: the intra-block reversal increases habit sensitivity without inflating working memory demands, while the hands-attack task captures naturalistic habit expression without artificial training, using a single, ecologically valid session. Both are suited for clinical applications, particularly where time constraints or cognitive load limit the feasibility of traditional approaches.",

    "title": "Wing mechanosensory modulation of optic flow-sensitive descending neurons in butterflies",
    "content": "Visual motion processing in flying insects is strongly modulated by behavioural state, yet the mechanisms by which mechanosensory feedback contributes to this modulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that wing mechanosensation alone is sufficient to modulate a subset of optic flow-sensitive descending neurons (WFDNs) in butterflies. Airflow stimulation of the wings, mimicking flight conditions, increased baseline firing rates and reduced response latencies in WFDNs, without altering response gain or temporal frequency tuning. These effects indicate that mechanosensory modulation acts through mechanisms distinct from those governing other state-dependent changes in visual processing. Consistent with this interpretation, previous work has shown that baseline firing and response latency can be rapidly modulated, whereas gain changes arise through slower neuromodulatory pathways. Mechanosensory modulation was cell-type specific: the horizontally tuned WFDNL neuron was consistently affected across individuals, whereas other WFDN types were largely insensitive, likely reflecting the unilateral airflow stimuli used here. Interestingly, WFDNL modulation arose exclusively from mechanosensory input from the proximal area of the wing, not from distal wing deformation. This suggests that descending visual pathways require only coarse gain or excitability modulation rather than detailed information about wing shape or strain, leaving fast reflexive control of distal wing deformation to local ganglionic circuits. Together, our results demonstrate that wing mechanosensation selectively modulates visual descending pathways by altering excitability and timing rather than visual feature encoding, supporting the existence of multiple, parallel mechanisms for state-dependent visual modulation during flight.",

    "title": "Multilevel sex-specific neurobiological signatures of early life adversity",
    "content": "Stress exposure early in life is an established risk factor for adult psychiatric illness, yet these disorders -- including anxiety disorders and depression -- show significant sex-dependence in prevalence, symptomatology, and treatment response. The biology underlying these differences remains largely unexplored and may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity in anxiety and depression. Here, we characterize the lasting impact of developmental stress on adulthood neurobiology and behavior in mice by combining analyses of multiple levels of brain function, including whole-brain c-Fos mapping, manganese-enhanced MRI and transcriptomics with advanced behavioral phenotyping. Across levels of investigation, we find distinct and often opposite effects of developmental stress depending on sex. These results together showcase the strong influence of sex on how early life adversity affects the onset of stress-related disorders. This work emphasizes the necessity of considering sex when investigating developmental and neurobiological underpinnings of stress-related disorders and displays a vast range of lasting effects of developmental stress on the brain, which provides a valuable resource for future studies aiming to improve psychiatric treatments.",

    "title": "Inhibition of Slc17a7 expressing neurons in the basolateral amygdala which project to the nucleus accumbens shapes the fidelity of motivated behavior",
    "content": "Adaptive behavior depends on the ability to form predictive associations between environmental cues and biologically relevant outcomes. Classical models posit that projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) promote reward seeking, whereas projections to the central amygdala facilitate defensive responding. However, accumulating evidence indicates that molecular identity and inhibitory dynamics introduce additional layers of functional heterogeneity within these pathways. Genetically defined subsets of BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons can drive either reward-related or aversive behaviors, and single-cell imaging studies show that cue-responsive BLA ensembles undergo an inhibitory shift as conditioning progresses. How these molecular and inhibitory mechanisms interact within defined projections to shape motivated behavior remains unclear. To address this, we examined Vglut1-expressing BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons (Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc), the predominant excitatory population within this pathway. Whole-cell electrophysiology revealed that reward conditioning increases inhibitory synaptic input onto Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons and reduces intrinsic excitability. Using a dual-recombinase chemogenetic strategy, we found that selective inhibition of this projection enhances acquisition of a cued reward task, increases instrumental reward seeking, and elevates reward valuation in a two-choice preference assay. Similar enhancement was observed in a fear-discrimination task, where inhibition of Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons improved differentiation between threat- and safety-associated cues. These findings identify inhibitory regulation of Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons as a key mechanism that strengthens stimulus-outcome associations. By demonstrating that conditioning-associated inhibitory plasticity modulates this major BLA output pathway, the work refines prevailing models of BLA[-&gt;]NAc function and highlights inhibition as an important contributor to the fidelity of motivated behavior.To address this, we examined Vglut1-expressing BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons (Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc), the predominant excitatory population within this pathway.

    "title": "A pathogenic AMPA receptor gating mutation disrupts synapse-mitochondrion axis and stalls synapse maturation",
    "content": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are central regulators of excitatory synaptic transmission and play critical roles in activity dependent synapse maturation and circuit development. De novo missense mutations in AMPAR subunits have been widely linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Despite this, how these variants lead to neuronal dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the consequences of a recurrent pathogenic mutation in the GluA1 subunit (GRIA1 p.A636T), which alters AMPAR gating properties and is associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. We developed a GluA1A636T knock-in mouse model, we show that GluA1A636T mice exhibit impairments in hippocampal dependent learning and working memory accompanied by reduced baseline activity of CA1 neurons in vivo. Mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomic analyses of juvenile and adult hippocampal samples revealed that the A636T mutation significantly alters synaptic protein expression at both ages. Notably, the mutation drives a robust upregulation of mitochondrial proteins specifically in adult mice. Consistent with this, dendritic mitochondria in adult GluA1A636T mice exhibited altered morphology and increased oxidative stress. Electrophysiological analyses further revealed abnormalities in synaptic function, including reduced basal excitatory transmission, persistence of functionally silent synapses in adulthood, and altered synaptic plasticity consistent with impaired synapse maturation. Together, these findings demonstrate that a pathogenic AMPAR gating mutation disrupts the coordinated development of synaptic and metabolic programs in the hippocampus, linking altered excitatory signaling to delayed mitochondrial stress and enduring circuit dysfunction. Our study provides a developmental framework for understanding how disease-associated AMPAR variants impair brain function and highlights synapse mitochondria coupling as a critical axis in glutamate receptor ionotropic (GRI) disorders.",

    "title": "Reconciling contradictory models of subthalamic nucleus contributions to basal ganglia beta oscillations",
    "content": "Recent computational studies of Parkinsons disease have yielded contradictory findings regarding the role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in pathological beta oscillations, with some models implicating STN as essential for beta generation and others suggesting that STN suppresses oscillations. This work addresses these discrepancies by systematically investigating how the specific features of the integrate-and-fire neurons used in these models influence simulated basal ganglia network dynamics. Using both rate models and spiking network simulations incorporating coupled subthalamopallidal and pallidostriatal circuits, we demonstrate that the choice between leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) and quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) models to represent STN neurons fundamentally impacts the phase relationship between STN and external globus pallidus prototypical (Proto) neuron populations. QIF STN neurons establish in-phase coupling with Proto neurons, which enhances beta oscillation amplitude, while LIF STN neurons develop anti-phase relationships, which suppresses beta power. Through intervention experiments and parameter sweeps across physiologically relevant firing rates, we show that these phase-related effects persist robustly across network conditions, and we mathematically establish conditions under which these results are guaranteed to hold. Our findings reveal that the fundamental mathematical structure underlying spike generation, rather than other biophysical details, determines whether the subthalamopallidal loop acts as a beta amplifier or suppressor. This mechanistic insight reconciles contradictory findings in the literature, demonstrates that seemingly minor modeling choices can have profound consequences for understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets, and offers predictions for determining which model framework reflects the biological reality.",

    "title": "Neural modes in motor cortex cycle over fast timescales",
    "content": "The embedding of low-dimensional latent states in the activity of large neuron populations has become a tenet of systems neuroscience. Despite the stability of these latent representations over time, the underlying activity of individual neurons is known to change both within experimental sessions and across days; yet, less attention has been devoted to changes in the coordinated activity of neuron populations on short timescales, particularly under conditions where networks must adapt quickly (e.g., during learning or after injury). To investigate, patterns of individual neuron contributions to population state dimensions in motor cortex were tracked over short blocks of repeated reaching trials. The number of distinct encoding patterns was consistently less than the typical dimensionality reported for motor cortex. Although the neuron population state space and dynamics were effectively conserved, these underlying encoding patterns changed in two ways: fast switches among themselves, as well as slow modifications over time. To explore whether these two drift timescales shared a common physiological mechanism, we analyzed the response of motor cortex to a causal perturbation. Direct electrical current was passed through two recording electrodes to terminate a small number of neurons, which evoked drift over both fast and slow timescales, both together and independently. While changes in fast switch rates were not necessarily associated with behavioral deficits, a significant increase in slow drift was accompanied by a decrease in behavioral performance. Together, these results reveal an additional timescale of drift in correlated population activity that could help guide the discovery of cellular and network mechanisms responsible for the maintenance, (re)learning, and recovery of low-dimensional structure in neuron populations.",

    "title": "The curse of dimensionality in motor cortex",
    "content": "Understanding how motor cortex generates movement is a foundational challenge in neuroscience. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), are widely used to transform high-dimensional neural data into a more interpretable, low-dimensional space. It is broadly assumed that the dimensionality of a particular motor task--that is, the number of principal components needed to explain a fixed fraction of variance--is an intrinsic property of the underlying neural dynamics, potentially modulated by task complexity. Here, we show that unsupervised estimates of dimensionality do not converge but instead scale with the number of recorded neurons. Across four animals, we found that while low-dimensional structure reflects changes in behavioral context, traditional metrics of dimensionality are relatively insensitive to increasingly complex movements. Rather, dimensionality increases with electrode count, exhibiting non-saturating growth as recordings scale to 1000 electrodes. While decoders trained on unsupervised subspaces showed only modest gains with scale, supervised methods leveraged additional electrodes to separate neural states more effectively. Surprisingly, the percentage of variance required for accurate supervised reach decoding became vanishingly small at high electrode counts (<0.1% at 1000 electrodes). Our results challenge current views on cortical dimensionality and highlight the divergent properties of supervised versus unsupervised learning, motivating careful consideration of appropriate computational methods as experimental data volumes scale.",

    "title": "Comprehensive 3D mapping reveals distinct spatial gradients of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen",
    "content": "In addition to spatially organized excitatory forebrain inputs along its mediolateral, dorsoventral, and anteroposterior axes, the striatum relies on cellular diversity to subserve its myriad processing functions. Distinct striatal GABAergic interneuron subtypes, including somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) interneurons likely subserve complementary computational roles. However, a detailed understanding of how these microcircuit components are distributed across striatal territories remains lacking. To address this gap, we generated a comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen using genetic labeling, brain-wide imaging, and voxel-wise quantification. We found that SST and TH interneurons were relatively enriched in the ventral caudoputamen, whereas PV interneurons were enriched dorsally. In addition, PV and TH interneurons exhibited opposing anteroposterior distribution patterns, with PV interneurons enriched posteriorly and TH interneurons showing a marked decline in density towards the striatal tail. Consequently, while the three interneuron subtypes displayed comparable densities in the functionally defined lateral striatum and anterior ventromedial striatum, PV interneurons predominated in the dorsomedial striatum and tail of striatum. We did not observe major sex differences. Together, these findings reinforce the view that the striatum is not a monolithic structure: in addition to structured excitatory inputs, inhibitory microcircuits themselves are differentially distributed across striatal territories, providing region-specific constraints on circuit computation. By integrating interneuron organization into existing anatomical frameworks, this atlas provides a foundation for linking striatal anatomy to function across behavioral domains.",

    "content": "Precise, anticipatory movements depend on the brain ability to generate motor commands in advance of immediate sensory input. Although the cerebellar cortex receives abundant sensory input via the mossy fiber pathway, the mechanisms by which continuous sensory signals are transformed or gated remain poorly understood. Here we show that molecular layer interneurons acquire persistent sensory-related activity in mice that develop anticipatory behavior. Employing a targeted lick interception task, we found that interneurons in lobule Crus I exhibit enhanced activity up to five seconds before movement onset locked to the spatial position of a continuously moving target independent of body movement. In more anticipatory mice, movement onset becomes linked to the dynamics of this persistent activity, whereas less anticipatory mice adjust their movements based on immediate sensory related input. Moreover, chemogenetic inhibition of Crus I, but not Crus II, impairs behavioral performance and delays lick onset without altering overall lick parameters. Our results indicate that anticipation in dynamic sensorimotor tasks relies on sensory representations encoded by interneurons.",

    "title": "An entropic explanation of insistence on sameness in autism",
    "content": "PurposeAn information theory-based framework is proposed in attempt to explain insistence on sameness in autism as an instance of a general behavior pattern in which an individual tries to reduce surprise and uncertainty. It offers a new definition of autism as an impairment in which cognitive functions are restricted to discrimination, memorization and prediction of tangible properties of the environment.MethodsAn analogy between insistence on sameness and constrained minimization of the entropy metric is observed and examined for a set of assumptions that describe cognitive limitations of a person with autism. The metric is given by the formula DH(R, M) = H(R|M)+H(M|R), where R represents sequences of random stimuli, M is a memory that stores and retrieves them, and where H(\u00b7|\u00b7) denotes their conditional entropies interpreted as surprise and uncertainty, respectively.ResultsIt is first inferred that to minimize the metric an individual can learn about R (and store that knowledge in M) or can restrict R to the already known M. Then, it is concluded that insistence on sameness is a manifestation of the latter. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed framework: (1) Helps to quantify the concepts of surprise, uncertainty, sensory overload and deprivation, anxiety, comfort zone, disappointment, disorientation, pedantry, rigidness, observance or aberrant precision. (2) Leads to a list of guidelines for learning therapies and daily care routines, and allows them to be defined as optimization algorithms and implemented as programs for robotic live-in caregivers. (3) Can be validated with the help of a Turing test-like approach that requires no experiments involving individuals with autism.ConclusionThe framework\u2014if positively validated\u2014will provide advantages of both theoretical and practical importance: it explains the insistent on sameness as a consequence of cognitive restrictions and offers formal foundations and design guidelines for therapies aimed at improving self-reliance of individuals with autism in basic activities of daily living.",

    "title": "Clinical exome sequencing identifies novel gene variants associated with ischemic stroke in the Saudi Tabuk population",
    "content": "BackgroundVariants linked to the risk of ischemic stroke have been discovered through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). These variations frequently have little consequences that lack apparent biological significance. Hence, these findings demonstrate that exome sequencing can be highly relevant to stroke, even though stroke is a complex phenotype with various diseases and risk factors.MethodologyIn this case-control investigation, we used ARMS genotyping to investigate the distribution of polymorphic variations in genes associated with stroke susceptibility. In addition to examine the novel gene variations associated with ischemic stroke we utilized the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform for whole-exome sequencing (WES).ResultsResults identified 11 novel gene variants in the GSTT4 gene by targeted whole-exome sequencing, including one deletion GSTT4p.Asn232LysfsTer6, one insertion c.688_689insCG, and 9 SNVs c.699\u202fT\u202f>\u202fC, c.701C\u202f>\u202fG, c.708G\u202f>\u202fT, c.710\u202fT\u202f>\u202fG, c.712A\u202f>\u202fG, c.712A\u202f>\u202fG, c.718A\u202f>\u202fT, c.719G\u202f>\u202fA, c.721A\u202f>\u202fT, c.722G\u202f>\u202fT in the ischemic stroke patients. We also identified several rare, intermediate, and most common gene variants in cholesterol associated genes LDLR, LDLRAD2, LDLRAD3, APOA2, APOA3, APOA4, APOA5, and PCSK9. Also, several common gene variants were reported in MTHFR, KLF14, eNOS3, and ACE by whole-exome sequencing. Furthermore, the eNOS3-GG and eNOS3-GT genotypes were associated with susceptibility to ischemic stroke (OR\u202f=\u202f1.95, p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionThis case-control study identified 11 novel GSTT4 variants and several known polymorphisms associated with ischemic stroke risk in Saudi patients. These findings highlight population-specific genetic factors that warrant further functional and large-scale validation.",

    "title": "The complex impact of auditory error direction, magnitude, and exposure on corrective responses",
    "content": "PurposeWhen encountering errors, the brain produces within-production corrective responses to compensate for the errors. The brain also develops adaptive responses to ensure the accuracy of future productions. This study examined the impact of the number of exposures to errors with different characteristics on corrective and adaptive responses.MethodsWe designed a compensation paradigm to apply three perturbation magnitudes in two directions within the two-dimensional formant space: (1) a concurrent increase in the first formant and decrease in the second formant, acoustically shifting /\u025b/ toward /\u00e6/ (\u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations), and (2) a concurrent increase in the first formant and increase in the second formant, shifting /\u025b/ toward the outside of the vowel space (\u025b-to-out perturbations). To calculate corrective responses in perturbed trials, we determined the difference between formants in the late (300\u2013400 ms) and early (0\u2013100 ms) intervals of the vowel. We estimated adaptive responses in unperturbed trials by calculating formant changes in the early interval of the post-perturbation trial relative to the early interval of the pre-perturbation trial. We examined the responses in the first and second halves of trials in each condition to determine the effect of exposure to perturbations.ResultsWe found that (1) corrective responses to \u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations were larger and proportionally larger for small perturbations in the first half of perturbed trials, (2) adaptive responses were measurable after exposure to a single perturbation, and (3) strikingly, both corrective and adaptive response directions were generally in the participant-specific \u025b-\u026a direction, regardless of the perturbation direction. This preferred response direction was in the opposite direction of the \u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations but was perpendicular to the \u025b-to-out perturbations.ConclusionOur findings suggest that the brain responds more to small and natural-sounding errors (\u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations) than large and unnatural errors (\u025b-to-out perturbations). The brain\u2019s biases in selecting movements may influence error compensation, leading to responses that prioritize preferred movements even when they do not fully correct errors (e.g., responding in the \u025b-\u026a direction for \u025b-to-out perturbations). Finally, as the brain encounters more unexpected errors, it may evaluate them differently and respond less to them.",

    "title": "Astrocyte-gated multi-timescale plasticity for online continual learning in deep spiking neural networks",
    "content": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a paradigm of energy-efficient, event-driven computation that is well-suited for processing asynchronous sensory streams. However, training deep SNNs robustly in an online and continual manner remains a formidable challenge. Standard Backpropagation-through-Time (BPTT) suffers from a prohibitive memory bottleneck due to the storage of temporal histories, while local plasticity rules often fail to balance the trade-off between rapid acquisition of new information and the retention of old knowledge (the stability-plasticity dilemma). Motivated by the tripartite synapse in biological systems, where astrocytes regulate synaptic efficacy over slow timescales, we propose Astrocyte-Gated Multi-Timescale Plasticity (AGMP). AGMP is a scalable, online learning framework that augments eligibility traces with a broadcast teaching signal and a novel astrocyte-mediated gating mechanism. This slow astrocytic variable integrates neuronal activity to dynamically modulate plasticity, suppressing updates in stable regimes while enabling adaptation during distribution shifts. We evaluate AGMP on a comprehensive suite of neuromorphic benchmarks, including N-Caltech101, DVS128 Gesture, and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD). Experimental results demonstrate that AGMP achieves accuracy competitive with offline BPTT while maintaining constant O(1) temporal memory complexity. Furthermore, in rigorous Class-Incremental Continual Learning scenarios (e.g., Split CIFAR-100), AGMP significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting without requiring replay buffers, outperforming state-of-the-art online learning rules. This work provides a biologically grounded, hardware-friendly path toward autonomous learning agents capable of lifelong adaptation.",

    "title": "Case Report: Progressive myoclonus epilepsy as an early manifestation of neuronopathic Gaucher disease",
    "content": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by biallelic GBA1 variants. Epilepsy is uncommon in GD and rarely manifests as progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), making early recognition difficult. We describe a 20-year-old man with childhood-onset myoclonus that progressed to drug-resistant generalized seizures and cognitive decline. Video-electroencephalography (VEEG) showed generalized polyspike-wave discharges associated with myoclonic jerks, whereas brain magnetic resonance imaging was initially normal. Cerebrospinal fluid studies, metabolic screening, and autoimmune encephalitis antibody panels were unremarkable. Glucocerebrosidase activity was markedly reduced, and a targeted myoclonic-epilepsy gene panel identified two GBA1 variants: c.907C\u202f>\u202fA (p. Leu303Ile) and c.1505G\u202f>\u202fA (p. Arg502His), indicating a presumed compound-heterozygous state consistent with neuronopathic GD type 3. No hepatosplenomegaly or skeletal abnormalities were detected. Seizure control remained poor despite multiple antiseizure medications and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). To contextualize this case, we systematically reviewed 22 publications encompassing 71 GD3-PME patients. Most cases presented in childhood, frequently showed typical electrophysiological patterns of generalized or multifocal polyspike-wave discharges, and had early normal MRI followed by later cerebellar or brainstem atrophy. Recurrent compound-heterozygous GBA1 variants, markedly reduced enzyme activity, and poor therapeutic response were common findings. The accompanying systematic review highlights the heterogeneity and therapeutic limitations of GD3-associated PME and underscores the importance of incorporating metabolic and genetic testing into the evaluation of unexplained PME for timely diagnosis and tailored management.",

    "title": "Complex network behavior in epileptic patients treated with Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS): VNS responders exhibit a unique pattern, different from VNS non-responders and healthy controls",
    "content": "IntroductionVagus nerve stimulation (VNS) represents an alternative treatment option in drug-resistant epilepsy. VNS patients can be categorized as responders (R, \u226550% seizure reduction) or non-responders (NR, < 50% seizure reduction). We demonstrate that VNS responders and VNS non-responders differ in their electrophysiological characteristics based on pre-implantation EEG analysis, specifically evaluated using relative mean power (RPW) and various information Entropy estimators computed in both he frequency and time domains. Based on the RPW and the Entropy estimators, we define and analyze the Unique Characteristics (UCs) of the individual (R and NR) groups of epileptic patients as well as Common Characteristics (CCs) that differentiate epileptic patients from healthy controls (HCs).MethodsWe investigated pre-implantation time series in 59 epileptic patients treated with VNS (24 VNS responders, 35 VNS non-responders). Subsequently, we acquired the EEG time series for 37 age- and gender-matched HCs. The EEG recordings of these three groups were filtered into standard frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) and segmented into eight consecutive time intervals, containing specific types of stimulation and resting states. For each of these segments, the RPW and seven Entropy estimators were calculated. We focused on the distribution of features differentiating between the epileptic patients (VNS responders or non-responders) and the HCs.ResultsWe identified 41 UCs (7 in RPW, 34 in Entropy) of VNS responders, in contrast to 19 UCs (4 in RPW, 15 in Entropy) of VNS non-responders. The UCs of VNS responders exhibit a specific pattern, showing their binding in the frequency domain to the alpha band and temporal binding to the segments of hyperventilation stimulation. The UCs of VNS non-responders were also temporally linked to hyperventilation, but mainly in the theta and gamma frequency bands.ConclusionThe VNS responders exhibit more differences when compared to HCs than VNS non-responders. These differences can be observed in RPW, but they become more pronounced when Entropy analysis is applied. It seems that the distinct response to hyperventilation is present in both VNS responders and non-responders, differentiating them from HCs. However, the binding of this response to frequency bands differs among VNS responders and non-responders. In particular, the reaction among the VNS responders is strongly associated with the alpha frequency band.",

    "content": "IntroductionMonogenic neurodevelopmental disorders (mNDDs) such as SNAREopathies exhibit complex electrophysiological features and diversity among clinical symptoms, complicating the mapping of electro-clinical relationships, essential for improving diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Establishing robust normative electrophysiological feature distributions from typically developing populations enables precise, individualized quantification of patient-specific abnormalities. Here, we introduce a multivariate framework to reveal patient-specific electrophysiological phenotypes and clinical severity dimensions of direct relevance for individual prognosis and therapeutic tracking.MethodsWe analyzed resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data from15 SNAREopathy subjects (STXBP1 and SYT1) and 96 age-matched healthy controls. EEG biomarkers, including absolute power, relative power, and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC), were estimated across frequency bands and functional networks. Normative baselines of EEG features were established using principal component analysis (PCA) on controls. We computed patient deviations from normative distributions using Mahalanobis distances. We summarized clinical severity by applying PCA to assessments of motor, manual, communication, adaptive functioning, and severity ranking of qualitative EEG.ResultsThe normative qEEG space identified diffuse, spectro-spatial patterns for absolute power, while relative power and LRTC displayed frequency-specific distributions. Clinical PCA identified a primary dimension of clinical impairment integrating deficits in mobility, hand function, communication, and adaptive behavior, whereas the secondary component captured the severity of qualitative EEG abnormalities. Patient deviations from normative absolute and relative power correlated with the primary, while LRTC deviations aligned with the secondary severity component.DiscussionNormative qEEG deviance metrics correspond to distinct clinical severity dimensions in SNAREopathies, making them promising for tracking disorder progression and therapeutic response.",

    "title": "Prediction error coding as the computational basis for nocifensive and nocifensive-like behaviors",
    "content": "Nocifensive behavior (NB) is a protective response to noxious stimuli that threaten tissue damage. However, similar motor responses, termed nocifensive-like behavior (NLB), can be evoked by unexpected innocuous stimuli. This observation challenges strict \u201clabeled-line\u201d models of pain, raising a fundamental question: how does the nervous system discriminate true threats from false alarms? We review evidence suggesting NB and NLB exist on a shared behavioral continuum, where defensive responses aren\u2019t determined solely by sensory input but by the brain\u2019s integrated threat assessment. This assessment computes the probability of harm by weighing somatosensory input against contextual factors like prior experience and multisensory cues. We propose this process is governed by a threat prediction error (TPE) mechanism, which is computationally analogous to the reward prediction error (RPE) mechanism encoded by the dopaminergic system. Under this framework, defensive responses are scaled to the magnitude of the TPE \u2013 the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory outcomes. Critically, this means the surprise of a benign touch in a dangerous environment can produce a larger TPE \u2013 and a stronger withdrawal \u2013 than the anticipation of a noxious pinprick in a safe environment. Furthermore, while NLB represents an adaptive response that can be permanently resolved as the stimulus is learned to be non-threatening, NB represents an innate response, permitting only transient suppression due to the real risk of injury. This model positions defensive behaviors as dynamic perceptual decisions arising from probabilistic inference, offering a unified theory for how context and expectation gate the expression of protective motor programs.",

    "title": "First computational characterization of HTR5A-AS1: a schizophrenia-linked antisense RNA with synaptic functions",
    "content": "Background/objectivesSchizophrenia is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the global population. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped most schizophrenia risk variants to noncoding regions, highlighting the role of regulatory processes and noncoding RNAs in schizophrenia pathology. Despite this, and schizophrenia's association with 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) system dysfunction, HTR5A-AS1, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) antisense to the serotonin receptor (HTR, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor) gene HTR5A, remains virtually unstudied. This study provides the first systematic characterization of HTR5A-AS1, validating its transcript structure and investigating its genetic associations, expression dynamics, developmental regulation, and potential synaptic and GABAergic functions in schizophrenia.MethodsTranscriptome-wide association study (TWAS) summary statistics were integrated with postmortem RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), BrainSpan developmental transcriptomes, UCSC Genome Browser annotations, and functional prediction tools. These complementary approaches enabled validation of the transcript's structure, quantification of regional and developmental expression, and assessment of potential molecular functions.ResultsHTR5A-AS1 showed significant TWAS associations with schizophrenia in the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). In postmortem schizophrenia donor tissue, expression was significantly reduced in the hippocampus, with a non-significant but directionally similar decrease in the dlPFC; sex-stratified analyses revealed that hippocampal reductions were strongest in male donors. Parallel analyses showed modest hippocampal downregulation of the paired receptor gene HTR5A, again driven primarily by males. Developmental transcriptomes revealed region-specific developmental trajectories, with steep increases during adolescence, aligning with the age range of typical schizophrenia onset. HTR5A-AS1 was strongly co-expressed with HTR5A, and functional predictions implicated involvement in synaptic and GABAergic signaling, consistent with cortico-hippocampal circuit disruption in schizophrenia.ConclusionsThese findings provide the first evidence that HTR5A-AS1 is a bona fide antisense transcript with developmental and synaptic roles that may contribute to schizophrenia risk. Future single-cell and functional perturbation studies are needed to test causality and define mechanisms of regulation.",

We can easily search for AsPredicted links in all 250 open access papers from psychological science. The Papercheck package conveniently includes these in xml format in the <code>psychsci</code> object.</p>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"find-aspredicted-links\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Find AsPredicted Links</h2>\n<p>Extracting links is a bit trickier than just searching for \u201caspredicted.org\u201d, so we provide a convenient function for extracting them from papers: <code>aspredicted_links()</code>. It cleans up the links when they are incorrectly formatted, such as splitting \u201chttps://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=nq4xa3\u201d across two sentences at the question mark, which is common in scientific PDFs.</p>\n<p>This function returns a table with a row for each link found that indicates the location of the link in each paper. Many papers include the same link in multiple places, so we will just show you the unique links here, returned in the \u201ctext\u201d column.</p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb1\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb1-1\"><a href=\"#cb1-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>links <span class=\"ot\">&lt;-</span> <span class=\"fu\">aspredicted_links</span>(psychsci)</span>\n<span id=\"cb1-2\"><a href=\"#cb1-2\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb1-3\"><a href=\"#cb1-3\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"fu\">unique</span>(links<span class=\"sc\">$</span>text)</span>\n<span id=\"cb1-4\"><a href=\"#cb1-4\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\">#&gt;

Reviewers can access the preregistration, but it is anonymized.

Novel object task. Lemurs will be presented with a series of novel items (baseline, person, stationary object, moving object). For each item, we will measure lemurs\u2019 latency to approach and their interest in each item.\\r\\n2. Quantity discrimination task. Lemurs will make choices between smaller and larger pieces of food. We will measure choices for the larger piece.\\r\\n3. Persistence task. Lemurs will be presented with a piece of food in a box that is impossible to access. We will measure how many times and for how long subjects interact with the box.\\r\\n4. Temporal discounting task. Lemurs will be presented with a series of choices between a smaller piece of food immediately available and a larger piece of the same food available after a delay. We will measure their choices for the larger delayed option.\\r\\n5. A-not-B error task. Lemurs will be first familiarized with finding food at a container in one location (A), and then in the test trial visibly see the food moved from A to a new container (B). We will measure lemurs\u2019 choices for the correct location (B).\\r\\n6. Working memory task. Lemurs will see the experimenter hide food under one of 3 identical containers; after a 5s delay with occlusion, lemurs can choose one of the cups.

They will first learn that one container provides a food reward (whereas the other is always empty). Once they learn this, the reward contingencies will be switched in the test trials.

To do this, we will use generalized linear mixed models to analyze species\u2019 performance in each separate task. For each task, the dependent variable will be correct choices in that task, and the test predictor will be species. We will include subject ID as a random factor, and control for age, sex and trial number in models as relevant. Across analyses, we will compare the fit of different models using likelihood-ratio tests. In addition, we will also examine each individual\u2019s performance across the cognitive tasks, to examine whether performance on a given cognitive task predicts performance in other tasks. To do so we will first use pairwise bivariate correlations across all individuals as well as partitioning by species. If there were significant age-related variation in cognitive performance in tasks in the first phase of analyses, we will also use linear regressions accounting for age. Second, we will use a factor analysis to detect whether performance in different task co-vary across individuals (overall, and within each species).&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </span></span>\n<span id=\"cb4-15\"><a href=\"#cb4-15\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\">#&gt; AP_outliers      &quot;For each task, individuals will be excluded from relevant analyses if they fail to complete the task for three consecutive attempts.

Recently, a fully automatic comparison tool, (<a href=\"https://regcheck.app/\">RegCheck</a>) has been created by Jamie Cummins from the University of Bern, that relies on large language models and AI where users upload the manuscript, the preregistration, and receive an automated comparison. We take a slightly different approach. We retrieve the preregistration from AsPredicted automatically, and present users with the information about the preregistered sample size (which is straightforward given the structured approach of the AsPredicted template). We then recommend users to compare this information against the method section in the manuscript.</p>\n<section class=\"level3\" id=\"preregistration-sample-size-plan\">\n<h3 class=\"anchored\">Preregistration Sample Size Plan</h3>\n<p>You can access the sample size plan from the results of <code>aspredicted_retrieve()</code> under the column name <code>AP_sample_size</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb5\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb5-1\"><a href=\"#cb5-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\"># get the sample size section from AsPredicted</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb5-2\"><a href=\"#cb5-2\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>prereg_sample_size <span class=\"ot\">&lt;-</span> <span class=\"fu\">unique</span>(prereg<span class=\"sc\">$</span>AP_sample_size)</span>\n<span id=\"cb5-3\"><a href=\"#cb5-3\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb5-4\"><a href=\"#cb5-4\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\"># use cat(&quot;&gt; &quot;, x = _) with #| results: 'asis' in the code chunk</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb5-5\"><a href=\"#cb5-5\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\"># to print out results with markdown quotes</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb5-6\"><a href=\"#cb5-6\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>prereg_sample_size <span class=\"sc\">|&gt;</span> <span class=\"fu\">cat</span>(<span class=\"st\">&quot;&gt; &quot;</span>, <span class=\"at\">x =</span> _)</span></code><button class=\"code-copy-button\" title=\"Copy to Clipboard\"><i class=\"bi\"></i></button></pre></div>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>The study will compare four lemur species: ruffed lemur, Coquerel\u2019s sifakas, ring-tailed lemur and mongoose lemur at the Duke Lemur Center.

A more advanced version of this tool could attempt to identify the relevant information in the manuscript with a search for specific words used in the preregistration. Below, we also show how AI can be used to identify the related text in the manuscript. We first use Papercheck\u2019s inbuilt <code>search_text()</code> function to find sentences discussing the sample or participants. For the current paper, we see this simple approach works.</p>\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb6\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb6-1\"><a href=\"#cb6-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\"># match &quot;sample&quot; or &quot;# particip...&quot;</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb6-2\"><a href=\"#cb6-2\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>regex_sample <span class=\"ot\">&lt;-</span> <span class=\"st\">&quot;</span><span class=\"sc\">\\\\</span><span class=\"st\">bsample</span><span class=\"sc\">\\\\</span><span class=\"st\">b|</span><span class=\"sc\">\\\\</span><span class=\"st\">d+</span><span class=\"sc\">\\\\</span><span class=\"st\">s+particip</span><span class=\"sc\">\\\\</span><span class=\"st\">w+&quot;</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb6-3\"><a href=\"#cb6-3\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb6-4\"><a href=\"#cb6-4\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\"># get full paragraphs only from the method section</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb6-5\"><a href=\"#cb6-5\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>sample <span class=\"ot\">&lt;-</span> <span class=\"fu\">search_text</span>(paper, regex_sample, </span>\n<span id=\"cb6-6\"><a href=\"#cb6-6\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>                      <span class=\"at\">section =</span> <span class=\"st\">&quot;method&quot;</span>, </span>\n<span id=\"cb6-7\"><a href=\"#cb6-7\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>                      <span class=\"at\">return=</span> <span class=\"st\">&quot;paragraph&quot;</span>)</span>\n<span id=\"cb6-8\"><a href=\"#cb6-8\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb6-9\"><a href=\"#cb6-9\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>sample<span class=\"sc\">$</span>text <span class=\"sc\">|&gt;</span> <span class=\"fu\">cat</span>(<span class=\"st\">&quot;&gt; &quot;</span>, <span class=\"at\">x =</span> _)</span></code><button class=\"code-copy-button\" title=\"Copy to Clipboard\"><i class=\"bi\"></i></button></pre></div>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>We tested 39 lemurs living at the Duke Lemur Center (for subject information, see Table S1 in the Supplemental Material available online). We assessed four taxonomic groups: ruffed lemurs (Varecia species, n = 10), Coquerel\u2019s sifakas (Propithecus coquereli, n = 10), ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta, n = 10), and mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz, n = 9). Ruffed lemurs consisted of both red-ruffed and black-and-white-ruffed lemurs, but we collapsed analyses across both groups given their socioecological similarity and classification as subspecies until recently (Mittermeier et al., 2008). Our sample included all the individuals available for testing who completed the battery; two additional subjects (one sifaka and one mongoose lemur) initiated the battery but failed to reach the predetermined criterion for inclusion in several tasks or stopped participating over several days. All tests were voluntary: Lemurs were never deprived of food, had ad libitum access to water, and could stop participating at any time. The lemurs had little or no prior experience in relevant cognitive tasks such as those used here (see Table S1). All behavioral tests were approved by Duke University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The authors planned to test 10 mongoose lemurs, but one didn\u2019t feel like participating. This can happen, and it does not really impact the severity of the test, but the statistical power is slightly lower than desired, and it is a deviation form the original plan - both deserve to be discussed. This papercheck module can remind researchers they deviated from a preregistration, and discuss their deviation, or it can help peer reviewers to notice a deviation is not discussed.</p>\n<div

Papercheck\u2019s philosophy is that users should evaluate the information from automated checks, and that AI should be optional and never the default, it can be efficient to send the preregistered sample size and the text reported in the manuscript to a large language model, and compare the preregistration with the text in the method section. This is more costly (both financially and ecologically) but it can work better, as the researchers might not use words like \u2018sample\u2019 or \u2018participants\u2019 and a LLM provides more flexibility to match text across two documents.</p>\n<p>Papercheck makes it easy to extract the method section in a paper:</p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb7\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb7-1\"><a href=\"#cb7-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb7-2\"><a href=\"#cb7-2\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>method_section <span class=\"ot\">&lt;-</span> <span class=\"fu\">search_text</span>(paper, <span class=\"at\">pattern =</span> <span class=\"st\">&quot;*&quot;</span>, <span class=\"at\">section =</span> <span class=\"fu\">c</span>(<span class=\"st\">&quot;method&quot;</span>), <span class=\"at\">return =</span> <span class=\"st\">&quot;section&quot;</span>)</span></code><button class=\"code-copy-button\" title=\"Copy to Clipboard\"><i class=\"bi\"></i></button></pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>We can send the method section to an LLM, and ask which paragraph is most closely related to the text in the preregistration. Papercheck has a custom function to send text and a query to Groq. We use Groq because of its <a href=\"https://groq.com/privacy-policy/\">privacy policy</a>, as it will not retain data or train on data, which is important when sending text from scientific manuscripts that may be unpublished to a LLM.

The preregistered plan stated that they would test a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 15 individuals for each species. However, according to the text, they tested 10 ruffed lemurs, 10 Coquerel\u2019s sifakas, 10 ring-tailed lemurs, and 9 mongoose lemurs. The number of mongoose lemurs (9) is below the minimum of 10 individuals planned for each species, indicating a deviation from the preregistered plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we see, the LLM does a very good job evaluating whether the authors adhered to their preregistration in terms of the sample size. The long-run performance of this automated evaluation needs to be validated in future research - this is just a proof of principle - but it has potential for editors who want to automatically check if authors followed their preregistration, and for meta-scientists who want to examine preregistration adherence across a large number of papers. <strong>For such meta-scientific use-cases, however, the code needs to be extensively validated and error rates should be acceptably low (i.e., comparable to human coders).</strong></p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"automated-checks-can-be-wrong\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Automated Checks Can Be Wrong!</h2>\n<p>The use of AI to interpret deviations is convenient, but it can\u2019t replace human judgment. The following article, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797621991548\">Exploring the Facets of Emotional Episodic Memory: Remembering \u201cWhat,\u201d \u201cWhen,\u201d and \u201cWhich\u201d</a> also has a preregistration. A large language model will incorrectly state that the authors deviated from their preregistration. It misses that the authors explicitly say that Cohort B was not preregistered, and therefore, falling short of the planned sample size of 60 in that cohort should not be seen as a deviation from the preregistration. All flagged deviations from a preregistration should be manually checked. Papercheck is only intended to make checks of a preregistration more efficient, but in the end, people need to make the final judgment.

Other components of a preregistration, such as exclusions criteria, or the planned analysis, are also important to check. It might be more difficult to create automated checks for these components, given the great flexibility in how especially statistical analyses are reported. In an earlier paper we have discussed the benefits of create machine readable hypothesis tests, and we have argued that this should be considered the gold standard for a preregistration <span class=\"citation\">(<a href=\"#ref-lakens2021\">Lakens and DeBruine 2021</a>)</span>. Machine readable hypothesis tests would allow researchers to automatically check if <a href=\"https://scienceverse.github.io/scienceverse/articles/demo.html\">preregistered analyses are corroborated or falsified</a>. But we realize it will be some years before this becomes common practice.</p>\n<p>There are a range of other improvements and extensions that should be developed, such as support for multi-study papers that contain multiple preregistrations, and extending this code to preregistrations on other platforms, such as the OSF.

    "content": "<p>Are meta-scientists\nignoring philosophy of science (PoS)? Are they re-inventing the wheel? <a href=\"https://nomadit.co.uk/conference/metascience2025/p/17038\">A recent panel\nat the Metascience conference</a> engaged with this question, and the first\nsentence of the abstract states \u201cCritics argue that metascience merely\nreinvents the wheel of other academic fields.\u201d It\u2019s a topic I have been\nthinking about for a while, so I will share my thoughts on this question. In\nthis blog post I will only speak for myself, and not for any other metascientists. I studied philosophy for a year, read\nquite a lot about philosophy of science, regularly review for philosophy\njournals, have <a href=\"https://www.eurandom.tue.nl/event/perspectives-on-scientific-error/\" target=\"_blank\">co-organized a conference</a> that brings together philosophers and metascientists (and am <a href=\"https://perspectivesonscientificerror2026.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">co-organizing the next meeting</a>) and I currently have 3 ongoing collaborations with philosophers of\nscience. I would say it seems a bit far-fetched to claim I would be ignoring\nphilosophy of science, and just reinvent what that field has already done. But\nI am ignoring a lot of it. That is not something PoS should take personally. I\nam also ignoring a lot of metascientific work that is done. That seems\nperfectly normal to me \u2013 there is only so much work I need to engage with to do\nmy work better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I read a\nlot of the work philosophers of science have written that is relevant for\nmetascientists, and a lot they are currently writing. Too often, I find work in\nphilosophy of science on the replication crisis and related topics to be of quite\nlow quality, and mostly it turns out to be rather irrelevant for my work. It is\nvery common that philosophers seem to have thought about topics very little, and\nthe limited time they thought about a topic has been spent without any engagement\nwith actual scientists. This is especially true about the philosophical work on\nthe replication crisis. Having lived through it, and having thought about it\nevery day for the last 15 years, most of the work by philosophers is quite\nsuperficial. If you spent only 3 years fulltime on your paper (and I know\npeople who spent no more than a year full-time on an entire book!), it is just\nnot going to be insightful enough for me to learn anything I didn\u2019t know. Instead,\nI will notice a lot of mistakes, faulty assumptions, and incorrect conclusions.\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I recently\nread a book from a philosopher of science I was looking forward to, hoping I\nwould learn new things. Instead, I just thought \u2018but psychologists themselves\nhave done so much work on this that you are not discussing!\u2019 for 200 pages. I found\nthat quite frustrating. Maybe we should also talk about philosophers ignoring\nthe work by psychologists. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As I was\nbeing frustrated, a thought popped up. There are very few philosophers of\nscience, compared to the number of psychologists. Let\u2019s say I read the literature\non metascientific topics in psychology and philosophy, and only the top X% of\npapers make my work better. What is the probability that a psychologist has\nperformed work that is relevant for me as a metascientist, compared to work by\na philosopher? Because there are so many more psychologists than philosophers,\nall else equal, there will be many more important papers by psychologists than\nby philosophers that I should read. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\nall else is not equal. Psychologists have thought about all their crises for\nmore than 60 years, ever since the first crisis in the 70\u2019s </span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span>ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION\n{&quot;citationID&quot;:&quot;FepIi8Kn&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;formattedCitation&quot;:&quot;(Lakens,\n2025a, 2025b)&quot;,&quot;plainCitation&quot;:&quot;(Lakens, 2025a, 2025b)&quot;,&quot;noteIndex&quot;:0},&quot;citationItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:22538,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/EQQKHQS9&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:22538,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Twice\nin the history of social psychology has there been a crisis of confidence. The\nfirst started in the 1960s and lasted until the end of the 1970s, and the\nsecond crisis dominated the 2010s. Drawing on extensive quotes from articles\npublished during both crises, I examine the similarities and differences\nbetween these psychological crises. In this first of two articles, I focus on\nhow researchers discussed fundamental concerns about the replicability of\nfindings across the two crises. I reflect on five possible reasons why concerns\nabout failed replications received more attention during the second crisis, the\ncontinuing lack of incentives to perform replication studies, and the\nimportance of large-scale research projects to instigate\nchange.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;International Review of Social\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.5334/irsp.1036&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2397-8570&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;rips-irsp.com&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Concerns\nAbout Replicability Across Two Crises in Social\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.1036&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;38&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;}],&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2025&quot;,5,15]]},&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2025&quot;,5,12]]},&quot;citation-key&quot;:&quot;lakens_concerns_2025a&quot;}},{&quot;id&quot;:22540,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/VAJGUKCZ&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:22540,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;During\ntwo crises in social psychology, the first from the 1960s to the end of the\n1970s, and the second starting in 2010 and still ongoing, researchers discussed\nthe strength of theories in the field, the societal relevance of research, the\ngeneralizability of effects, and problematic methodological and statistical\npractices. Continuing on the first part of this review, which focused on\nreplicability, I compare similarities in the concerns raised across both\ncrises. I consider which issues have prompted meaningful reforms and which have\nyet to result in significant progress. Finally, I reflect on the extent that\nthe incentives contributed to these crises and argue that a more coordinated\napproach to scientific research is needed to prevent these concerns from\nresurfacing in a future third\ncrisis.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;International Review of Social\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.5334/irsp.1038&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2397-8570&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;rips-irsp.com&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Concerns\nAbout Theorizing, Relevance, Generalizability, and Methodology Across Two\nCrises in Social\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.1038&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;38&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;}],&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2025&quot;,5,15]]},&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2025&quot;,5,12]]},&quot;citation-key&quot;:&quot;lakens_concerns_2025&quot;}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"NL\">(Lakens, 2025a, 2025b)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">. Psychologists have a much better\nunderstanding of how psychological research is done than philosophers. Philosophers\nare on average smarter than psychologists (but again, there are many more psychologists), and have better training in\nconceptual analysis. Psychologists are more motivated to work on challenges in\ntheir field than philosophers. There are many other differences. So, we need to\nweigh all these factors in our model that will predict how many papers by\nphilosophers of science I find useful to read, compared to the number of papers\nby psychologists I find useful to read. I don\u2019t have those weights, but I have\nthe outcome of the model for my own research: Most often, papers by\npsychologists on metascience are better and more relevant for my work. Remember: I still ignore a lot of the papers on metascience by psychologists, and I find a lot of those\npapers low quality as well! But psychologists write a lot more on the topic,\nand I also think the best papers on metascience when I combine both fields are\nmore often written by psychologists. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I think\nthis alternative explanation for why we engage very little with philosophers of\nscience is worth taking into account. I personally consider it a strong\ncontender to explain the behavior of metascientists to an explanation that\nposits that we intentionally do not engage with the literature in philosophy of\nscience. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">There are\nadditional reasons for why I end up reading less work by philosophers of\nscience. One is that I often do not agree with certain assumptions they have.\nThe ideas that guide my work have been out of fashion in philosophy of science\nfor half a century. Most of the ideas that are in fashion turn me off. I just\ndo not enjoy reading papers that say \u2018Let\u2019s assume scientists are rational\nBayesian updaters\u2019 or \u2018There is not one way to do science\u2019. My working model of\nscience is something very different, best summarized by this cartoon: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"NL\"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype\n id=\"_x0000_t75\"

ignore most of the work by philosophers of science on metascience, I still\nengage with quite a lot of philosophy of science. If you browse through the <a href=\"https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/references.html\">reference\nlist</a> of my online textbook \u2013 which is about statistics! \u2013 I am confident\nthat there are more philosophers cited than the number of metascientists cited in a book by a philosopher of science. If you browse through the reading\nnotes of the podcast \u2018<a href=\"https://nulliusinverba.podbean.com/\">Nullius in\nVerba</a>\u2019 that I record with Smriti Mehta, I am confident that there are more\npapers by philosophers than there are papers by metascientists in podcasts by\nphilosophers of science. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I just\nwanted to share these thoughts to provide some more diversity to the ideas\nthat were shared in the panel at the Metascience conference. When \u201cthis panel\nasks what is new about metascience, and why it may have captured greater\nattention than previous research and reform initiatives\u201d maybe one reason is\nthat on average this literature is better and more relevant for researchers\ninterested in how science works, and how it could work. I know that is not going to be a very popular viewpoint for philosophers to read, but it is my viewpoint, and I think no one can criticize me for not engaging with philosophy of science enough. I have at least a moderately informed opinion on this matter.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">P.S.

    "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

To date, the performance of the trim and fill\nmethod has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more\ncomprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in\na number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those\nfrom usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely\nuse of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in\nthe meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the\nperformance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study\nheterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive\neffect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is\npresent the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than\nthe usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate\nfrom the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the\npresence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our\nsimulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the\npresence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce\nthe bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not\nideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly\ncaused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the\nperformance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various\nmeta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form\nof sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.2889&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n17476644&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;4544-4562&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Performance\nof the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and\nbetween-study\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Peters&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jaime\nL.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Sutton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Alex\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;David\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Abrams&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Keith\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Rushton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lesley&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2007&quot;,11,10]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/DMQP989N&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;It\nis known that the existence of publication bias can influence the conclusions\nof a meta-analysis. Some methods have been developed to deal with publication\nbias, but issues remain. One particular method called 'trim and fill' is\ndesigned to adjust for publication bias. The method, which is intuitively\nappealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a simple and\npopular graphical tool called the funnel plot. We present a simulation study\ndesigned to evaluate the behaviour of this method. Our results indicate that\nwhen the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they estimate different\neffects), trim and fill may inappropriately adjust for publication bias where\nnone exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously adjust for non-existent\nbias if (i) the variability among studies causes some precisely estimated\nstudies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii) an inverse\nrelationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is introduced by the\nstudies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest that the funnel plot\nitself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses. Selection modelling is\nan alternative method warranting further study. It performed better than trim\nand fill in our simulations, although its frequency of convergence varied,\ndepending on the simulation parameters.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.1461&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n12820277&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;2113-2126&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Adjusting\nfor publication bias in the presence of\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Terrin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Norma&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schmid&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Christopher\nH.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lau&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joseph&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Olkin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ingram&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2003&quot;,7,15]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Peters\net al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

Specifying a\nrange of values around zero allows researchers to statistically reject the\npresence of effects large enough to matter, and prevents practically\ninsignificant effects from being interpreted as a statistically significant\ndifference. We compare the behavior of the recently proposed second generation\np-value (Blume, D\u2019Agostino McGowan, Dupont, &amp; Greevy, 2018) with the more\nestablished Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) equivalence testing procedure\n(Schuirmann, 1987). We show that the two approaches yield almost identical\nresults under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g., when the\nconfidence interval is wider than the equivalence range, or when confidence\nintervals are asymmetric) the second generation p-value becomes difficult to\ninterpret. The second generation p-value is interpretable in a dichotomous\nmanner (i.e., when the SGPV equals 0 or 1 because the confidence intervals lies\ncompletely within or outside of the equivalence range), but this dichotomous\ninterpretation does not require calculations. We conclude that equivalence\ntests yield more consistent p-values, distinguish between datasets that yield\nthe same second generation p-value, and allow for easier control of Type I and\nType II error rates.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.933&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Daniel Lakens, Marie Delacre&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;1-11&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Equivalence\nTesting and the Second Generation\nP-Value&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Delacre&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marie&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,7,13]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lakens\n&amp; Delacre, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

In\nthis article we assume that the overall goal researchers wish to achieve is to\nmaximize the utility gained by conducting the replication study. We then\npropose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the\nreplication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The\nreplication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we\ncould gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a)\nthe value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim\nbased on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal\ndecision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph\nmodeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of\nexpected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative\nestimates of replication value.

In\naddition, we carefully examine possible measures, test auxiliary assumptions,\nand identify boundary conditions of measuring value and uncertainty. We end our\nreport by discussing how future validation studies might be designed. Our study\ndemonstrates the importance of investigating how to implement study selection\nstrategies in practice.

Methodologists have proposed a variety\nof statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is\nnot clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here,\nwe present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of\nthe most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might\nrealistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several\nlevels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity,\nand used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature.

We give exact theoretical results showing\nhow selection for significance affects the distribution of statistical power in\na heterogeneous population of significance tests.

The p-uniform\nand p-curve methods performed well with a fixed effects size and varying sample\nsizes. However, when there was substantial variability in effect sizes as well\nas sample sizes, both methods systematically overestimate mean power. With\nheterogeneity in effect sizes, the maximum likelihood model produced the most\naccurate estimates when the distribution of effect sizes matched the\nassumptions of the model, but z-curve produced more accurate estimates when the\nassumptions of the maximum likelihood model were not met.

The properties of\np-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of\nthese simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be\nused as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a\ncertain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually\ndemonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous\nmathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined\nwithout simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any\nstatistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough\nevaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions\np-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition,\nwe used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of\npublication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence\nthe shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than\n1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also\nsuggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an\narticle as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level.\nThis gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of\nreal effects even when no such effects are actually present.

What is fair to say is that\nstatisticians failed to engage with an incredibly important topic (test for\npublication bias) that addressed a clear need in many scientific communities,\nas most of the criticism was by psychological methodologists. I fully agree\nthat statisticians should have engaged more with this technique. I believe the\nreason that they didn\u2019t is because there is a real problem in the reward\nstructure in statistics, where statisticians get greater rewards inside their\nfield by proposing a 12<sup>th</sup> approach to compute confidence intervals\naround a non-parametric effect size estimate for a test that no one uses, than\nto help psychologists solve a problem they really need a solution for. Indeed,\nfor a statistician, publication bias is a very messy business, and there will\nnever be a sufficiently rigorous test for publication bias to get credit from\nfellow statisticians. There are no beautiful mathematical solutions, no\ncreative insights, there is only the messy reality of a literature that is\nbiased by human actions that we can never adequately capture in a model. The\nfact that empirical researchers often don\u2019t know where to begin to evaluate the\nreliability of claims in their publication-bias-ridden field is not something\nstatisticians care about.

Scrutiny is important, but we can\u2019t know how extensively methods\nshould be vetted, we don\u2019t know how to identify experts, everyone \u2013 including \u2018experts\u2019\n\u2013 is fallible. It is na\u00efve to think \u2018expert vetting\u2019 will lead to clear answers\nabout the methods we should use, and should not use. If we can\u2019t even reach\nagreement about the use of p-values, no one should believe we will ever reach\nagreement about the use of methods to detect publication bias, which will\nalways be messy at best. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I like my\nscience free from authority arguments. Everyone should do their best to\ncriticize everyone else, and if they are able, themselves. Some people will be\nin a better position to criticize some papers than others, but it is difficult\nto predict where the most fatal criticism will come from. Treating statistics\npapers published in a statistics journal as superior to papers in a psychology\njournal is too messy to be a good idea, and boil down to a form of elitism that\nI can\u2019t condone. Sometimes even a lowly 20% statistician can point out flaws in\nmethods proposed by card-carrying statisticians. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">What we can\ndo better is implementing actual quality control.

Peer reviews should be open, for\nall papers, including papers proposing new statistical methods.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">If we want\nour statistical methods to be of high quality, we need to specify quality\nstandards. Morey and Davis-Stober point out the limitations of simulation-based\ntests of a method and convincingly argue for the value of evaluating the\nmathematical properties of a testing procedure. If as a field we agree that an\nevaluation of the mathematical properties of a test is desirable, we should\ntrack whether this evaluation has been performed, or not. We could have a long\nchecklist of desirable quality control standards \u2013 e.g., a method has been\ntested on real datasets, it has been compared to similar methods, those\ncomparisons have been performed objectively based on a well-justified set of\ncriteria, etc. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One could\ncreate a database where for each method the quality standards that have been\nmet and that have not been met are listed. If considered useful, the database\ncould also track how often a method is used, by tracking citations, and listing\npapers that have implemented the method (as opposed to those merely discussing\nthe method). When statistical methods become widely used, the database would point\nresearchers to which methods deserve more scrutiny. The case of magnitude-based\ninference in sport science reveals the importance of a public call for scrutiny\nwhen a method becomes widely popular, especially when this popularity is\nlimited to a single field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The more\ncomplex methods are, the more limitations they have. This will be true for all\nmethods that aim to deal with publication bias, because the way scientists bias\nthe literature is difficult to quantify. Maybe as a field we will come to agree\nthat tests for bias are never accurate enough, and we will recommend people to\njust look at the distribution of p-values without performing a test. Alternatively,\nwe might believe that it is useful to have a testing procedure that too often\nsuggests a literature contains at least some non-zero effects, because we feel\nwe need some way to intersubjectively point out that there is bias in a\nliterature, even if this is based on an imperfect test. Such discussions\nrequire a wide range of stakeholders, and the opinion of statisticians about\nthe statistical properties of a test is only one source of input in this\ndiscussion. Imperfect procedures are implemented all the time, if they are the\nbest we have, and doing nothing is also not working. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Statistical\nmethods are rarely perfect from their inception, and all have limitations. Although\nI understand the feeling, banning all tests that have not been adequately vetted\nby an expert is inherently unscientific. Such a suggestion would destroy the\nvery core of science \u2013 an institution that promotes mutual criticism, while\naccepting our fallibility.

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "title": "MMoGCN: a multi-gate mixture of graph convolutional network model for EEG emotion and mood disorder recognition",
    "content": "Objective. Emotional states and mood disorders are closely interconnected, and their joint recognition serves as a critical pathway to uncovering their intrinsic relationship. Currently, deep learning (DL) models based on electroencephalogram (EEG) have achieved significant progress in single tasks such as emotion recognition or mood disorder (MD) recognition. However, most existing models are limited to handling only one of these tasks independently and fail to effectively leverage the shared features in EEG data related to both emotions and mood disorders. This limitation hinders the in-depth exploration of the complex interplay between emotions and mood disorders. Therefore, this study aims to develop an EEG-based DL framework for the joint recognition of emotions and mood disorders, thereby providing a foundation for further investigation into their interaction. Approach. We design a multi-gate mixture-of-experts graph convolutional network model(MMoGCN) for joint emotion and MD recognition. MMoGCN comprises three key modules: (1) a feature extraction module based on differential entropy to robustly represent EEG signals; (2) a Multi-gated shared experts module, which integrates two experts, and combines them through a gating mechanism to extract shared representations across tasks; and (3) adaptive task-specific towers, which consist of individual classification towers for each task and incorporate an adaptive weighting loss function to dynamically adjust task contributions. MMoGCN is evaluated on a self-collected dataset and further validated on the public DEAP dataset. Main results. MMoGCN achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines in both emotion and MD recognition. Validation experiments on DEAP further demonstrate the scalability and generalization of MMoGCN. Significance. An effective multi-task learning model is proposed for joint emotion and MD recognition based on EEG.

    "content": "Objective. Deep learning (DL) exhibits considerable potential for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) classification in electroencephalography-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs). SSVEP signals contain both frequency and phase characteristics that correspond to the visual stimuli. However, existing DL training strategies typically focus on either frequency or phase information alone, thus failing to fully exploit these dual inherent properties and substantially limiting classification accuracy. Approach. To tackle this limitation, this study proposes a joint frequency-phase training strategy (JFPTS), which comprises two complementary stages with distinct time-window sampling schemes. The first stage adopts a frequency prior-driven sampling scheme to improve frequency component utilization, whereas the second stage employs a phase-locked sampling scheme to enhance intra-category phase consistency. This design enables JFPTS to effectively leverage both frequency and phase properties of SSVEP signals. Main results. Comprehensive experiments on two well-established public datasets validate the effectiveness of JFPTS. The results demonstrate that the JFPTS-enhanced model achieves a marked superiority over the current state-of-the-art classification approaches, notably surpassing the long-standing performance benchmark set by task-discriminative component analysis (TDCA). Significance. Overall, JFPTS establishes a new training paradigm that advances DL approaches for SSVEP classification and promotes the broader adoption of SSVEP-BCIs.",

    "content": "Objective. Myoelectric control systems translate electromyographic (EMG) signals into control commands, enabling immersive human\u2013robot interactions in the real world and the Metaverse. The variability of EMG due to various confounding factors leads to significant performance degradation. Such variability can be mitigated by training a highly generalizable but massively parameterized deep neural network, which can be effectively scaled using a vast dataset. We aim to find an alternative simple, explainable, efficient and parallelizable model, which can flexibly scale up with a larger dataset and scale down to reduce model size, and thereby will significantly facilitate the practical implementation of myoelectric control. Approach. In this work, we discuss the scalability of a random forest (RF) for myoelectric control. We show how to scale an RF up and down during the process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and automatic self-calibration. The effects of diverse factors such as bootstrapping, decision tree editing (pre-training, pruning, grafting, appending), and the size of training data are systematically studied using EMG data from 106 participants including both low- and high-density electrodes. Main results. We examined several factors that affect the size and accuracy of the model. The best solution could reduce the size of RF models by 500\u00d7, with the accuracy reduced by only 1.5%. Importantly, for the first time we report the merit of RF that with more EMG electrodes (higher input dimension), the RF model size would be reduced. Significance. All of these findings contribute to the real time deployment RF models in real world myoelectric control applications.",

Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "content": "arXiv:2601.17373v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As Smart Home Personal Assistants (SPAs) evolve into social agents, understanding user privacy necessitates interpersonal communication frameworks, such as Privacy Boundary Theory (PBT). To ground our investigation, our three-phase preliminary study (1) identified transmission and sharing ranges as key boundary-related risk factors, (2) categorized relevant SPA functions and data types, and (3) analyzed commercial practices, revealing widespread data sharing and non-transparent safeguards. A subsequent mixed-methods study (N=412 survey, N=40 interviews among the survey participants) assessed users' perceived privacy risks across data types, transmission ranges and sharing ranges. Results demonstrate a significant, non-linear escalation in perceived risk when data crosses two critical boundaries: the `public network' (transmission) and `third parties' (sharing). This boundary effect holds robustly across data types and demographics. Furthermore, risk perception is modulated by data attributes (e.g., social relational data), and contextual privacy calculus. Conversely, anonymization safeguards show limited efficacy especially for third-party sharing, a finding attributed to user distrust. These findings empirically ground PBT in the SPA context and inform design of boundary-aware privacy protection.",

This hinders both critical viewing by users and scalable moderation on platforms. Here, we present Collab, a web plugin enabling users to collaboratively annotate deepfake videos. Collab integrates three key components: (i) an intuitive interface for spatio-temporal labeling where users provide confidence scores and rationales, facilitating detailed input even from non-experts, (ii) a novel confidence-weighted spatio-temporal Intersection-over-Union (IoU) algorithm to aggregate diverse user annotations into accurate aggregations, and (iii) a hierarchical demonstration strategy presenting aggregated results to guide attention toward contentious regions and foster critical evaluation. A seven-day online study (N=90), where participants annotated suspicious videos when viewing an online experimental platforms, compared Collab against two conditions without aggregation or demonstration respectively. Collab significantly improved identification accuracy and enhanced reflection compared to non-demonstration condition, while outperforming non-aggregation condition for its novelty and effectiveness.",

Despite decades of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research proposing various visualizations, user comprehension remains low, and designs rarely see widespread adoption. To understand this landscape and chart a path forward, we synthesized 65 top-tier papers using a framework adapted from the user-centered design lifecycle. Our analysis presented findings of the field's evolution across four dimensions: (1) the trade-off between information load and decision efficacy, which demonstrates a shift from augmenting disclosures to prioritizing information condensation and cognitive load management to counter the inefficacy of comprehensive texts, (2) the co-evolutionary dynamic of design and automation, revealing that complex design ambitions such as context-awareness drove the need for advanced NLP, while recent LLM breakthroughs are enabling the semantic interpretation required to realize those designs, (3) the tension between generality and specificity, highlighting the divergence between standardized, cross-platform solutions and the increasing necessity for specialized, context-aware interaction patterns in IoT and immersive environments, and (4) balancing stakeholder opinions, which shows that visualization efficacy is constrained by the complex interplay of regulatory mandates, developer capabilities and provider incentives. We conclude by outlining four critical challenges for future research.",

Despite rising scholarly attention, theoretical accounts of how such relationships develop remain fragmented. Existing frameworks address important aspects of the phenomenon, but they rarely treat human-chatbot communication as the central behavior that builds relationships. To address this gap, we propose the AI relationship process (AI-RP) framework. The AI-RP outlines relationship formation as a sequential process. (a) Chatbot characteristics shape users' (b) social perceptions. These perceptions guide (c) communication, and communication produces (d) relational outcomes such as attachment and companionship. The AI-RP introduces a six-features profile characterizing chatbots, a dual-route approach of social perception, a behavioral conceptualization of communication and discusses the foundation and types of artificial relationships. By foregrounding observable communicative behavior, the AI-RP provides a foundation for theory building and empirical research on the social and ethical implications of AI companionship.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.17238v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mobile video calls are widely used to share information about real-world objects and environments with remote collaborators. While these calls provide valuable visual context in real time, the experience of interacting with people and moving around a space is significantly reduced when compared to co-located conversations. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of Mobile Augmented Reality applications to enable more spatial forms of collaboration across distance. To better understand the dynamics of mobile AR collaboration and how this medium compares against the status quo, we conducted a comparative structured observation study to analyze people's perception of space and interaction with remote collaborators across mobile video calls and AR-based calls. Fourteen pairs of participants completed a spatial collaboration task using each medium. Through a mixed-methods analysis of session videos, transcripts, motion logs, post-task exercises, and interviews, we highlight how the choice of medium influences the roles and responsibilities that collaborators take on and the construction of a shared language for coordination. We discuss the importance of spatial reasoning with one's body, how video calls help participants \"be on the same page\" more directly, and how AR calls enable both onsite and remote collaborators to engage with the space and each other in ways that resemble in-person interaction. Our study offers a nuanced view of the benefits and limitations of both mediums, and we conclude with a discussion of design implications for future systems that integrate mobile video and AR to better support spatial collaboration in its many forms.",

While brain-heart coupling has been studied in healthy populations, the relationships between neural and cardiac activity across sleep stages in the presence of sleep disorders are not clear. This study examines the influence of brain-driven cardiac activity across sleep stages for individuals with sleep disorders. Overnight recordings of C3 and C4 electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from 146 individuals were preprocessed and analyzed in the frequency domain through a linear mixed-effect model. Our results show that parasympathetic activity is sensitive to changes in delta and beta powers during later stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as both band powers exhibited strong negative effects on high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) power. These findings show that neural activity can drive vagal tone across sleep stages, suggesting that treatments on key EEG bands during NREM and REM stages may help restore regular cardiac behaviour.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.17134v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding and modeling consumers' stylistic taste such as \"sporty\" is crucial for creating designs that truly connect with target audiences. However, capturing taste during the design process remains challenging because taste is abstract and subjective, and preference data alone provides limited guidance for concrete design decisions. This paper proposes an integrated human-centered computational framework that links subjective evaluations (e.g., perceived luxury of car wheels) with domain-specific features (e.g., spoke configuration) and computer vision-based measures (e.g., texture). By jointly modeling human-derived (consumer and designer) and machine-extracted features, our framework advances aesthetic assessment by explicitly linking model outcomes to interpretable design features. In particular, it demonstrates how perceptual features, domain-specific design patterns, and consumers' own interpretations of style contribute to aesthetic evaluations. This framework will enable product teams to better understand, communicate, and critique aesthetic decisions, supporting improved anticipation of consumer taste and more informed exploration of design alternatives at design time.",

    "title": "Acoustic Field Video for Multimodal Scene Understanding",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.17123v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We introduce and explore a new multimodal input representation for vision-language models: acoustic field video. Unlike conventional video (RGB with stereo/mono audio), our video stream provides a spatially grounded visualization of sound intensity across a scene, offering a new and powerful dimension of perceptual understanding. Our real-time pipeline uses low-cost beamforming microphone arrays that are already common in smart speakers and increasingly present in robotics and XR headsets, yet this sensing capability remains unutilized for scene understanding. To assess the value of spatial acoustic information, we constructed an evaluation set of 402 question-answer scenes, comparing a state-of-the-art VLM given conventional video with and without paired acoustic field video. Results show a clear and consistent improvement when incorporating spatial acoustic data; the VLM we test improves from 38.3% correct to 67.4%. Our findings highlight that many everyday scene understanding tasks remain underconstrained when relying solely on visual and audio input, and that acoustic field data provides a promising and practical direction for multimodal reasoning.

    "title": "Lost in Simulation: LLM-Simulated Users are Unreliable Proxies for Human Users in Agentic Evaluations",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.17087v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Agentic benchmarks increasingly rely on LLM-simulated users to scalably evaluate agent performance, yet the robustness, validity, and fairness of this approach remain unexamined. Through a user study with participants across the United States, India, Kenya, and Nigeria, we investigate whether LLM-simulated users serve as reliable proxies for real human users in evaluating agents on {\\tau}-Bench retail tasks. We find that user simulation lacks robustness, with agent success rates varying up to 9 percentage points across different user LLMs. Furthermore, evaluations using simulated users exhibit systematic miscalibration, underestimating agent performance on challenging tasks and overestimating it on moderately difficult ones. African American Vernacular English (AAVE) speakers experience consistently worse success rates and calibration errors than Standard American English (SAE) speakers, with disparities compounding significantly with age. We also find simulated users to be a differentially effective proxy for different populations, performing worst for AAVE and Indian English speakers. Additionally, simulated users introduce conversational artifacts and surface different failure patterns than human users. These findings demonstrate that current evaluation practices risk misrepresenting agent capabilities across diverse user populations and may obscure real-world deployment challenges.",

    "title": "Far from the Shallow: Brain-Predictive Reasoning Embedding through Residual Disentanglement",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.22860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are highly \"entangled,\" mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically, reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG) brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.",

    "title": "A flexible framework for structural plasticity in GPU-accelerated sparse spiking neural networks",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.19764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity, where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections. However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic applications.",

    "content": "arXiv:2505.14125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.",

    "title": "Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.10912v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.13481v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Understanding interactions in complex systems requires capturing the relative timing of coupling, not only its strength. Phase synchronization captures this timing, yet most methods either reduce the phase to its cosine or collapse it into scalar indices such as the phase-locking value, discarding relative timing. We propose a complex-valued phase synchrony (CVPS) framework that estimates phase with an adaptive Gabor wavelet and preserves both cosine and sine components. Simulations confirm that CVPS recovers true phase offsets and tracks non-stationary dynamics more faithfully than Hilbert-based methods. Because antipsychotics are known to modulate the timing of cortical interactions, they provide a rigorous context to evaluate whether CVPS can capture such pharmacological effects. CVPS further reveals cortical neuro-hemodynamic drivers, with occipital-to-parietal and prefrontal-to-striatal lead--lag flows consistent with known receptor targets, confirming its ability to capture pharmacological timing. CVPS, therefore, offers a robust, generalizable framework for detecting relative timing in complex systems such as the brain.",

However, the effect of key experimental factors, including as eye state (open or closed) or stimulating coil size, remain unclear. As such, it is unknown whether these factors must be kept consistent across multi-center studies, and whether differences in such factors may underpin contradictory findings in existing literature.\n  Materials and Methods: Threshold tracking TMS was employed to measure RMT and SICI (3ms interstimulus interval, conditioning at 70% of RMT) in 21 alert and awake, healthy controls. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from abductor pollicis brevis. Both RMT and SICI were measured under 6 conditions, while eyes were open or closed, using 3 figure-of-eight coils of differing winding diameter. Mixed effects modelling was employed to investigate effects of eye state and coil size on each measure.\n  Results: RMT was found to be significantly higher for the smallest (30BFT) coil compared to both larger (50BFT and 70BF) coils. No difference in SICI was identified across coil sizes. Eye state was not found to affect either RMT or SICI measurements.\n  Conclusions: Measurements of RMT and SICI can be considered comparable if recorded with eyes open or closed, provided the individual is awake and alert. Measurements of SICI recorded with figure-of-eight coils of different size can be considered comparable.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.17796v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While large neural nets perform impressively on specific tasks, they are unreliable and unsafe, as is shown by the persistent hallucinations of large language models. This paper shows that large neural nets are intrinsically unreliable, because it is not possible to make or validate a tractable theory of how a neural net works. There is no reliable way to extrapolate its performance from a limited number of test cases to an unlimited set of use cases. To have confidence in the performance of a neural net, it is necessary to enclose it in a guardrail which is provably safe, so that whatever the neural net does, there cannot be harmful consequences. World models have been proposed as a way to do this. This paper discusses the scope and architecture required of world models. World models are often conceived as models of the physical and natural world, using established theories of natural science, or learned regularities, to predict the physical consequences of AI actions. However, unforeseen consequences of AI actions impact the human social world as much as the physical world. To predict and control the consequences of AI, a world model needs to include a model of the human social world. I explore the challenges that this entails. Human language is based on a Common Ground of mutual understanding of the world, shared by the people conversing. The common ground is an overlapping subset of each persons world model, including their models of the physical, social and mental worlds. LLMs have no stable representation of a common ground. To be reliable, AI systems will need to represent a common ground with their users, including physical, mental and social domains.",

Here we study a spiking multi-layer network alternating wake-like and deep-sleep-like states, with state-dependent dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity in a biologically inspired thalamo-cortical framework. During wakefulness, the model learns from few perceived examples, while during deep sleep it undergoes spontaneous replay driven by slow oscillations. Plasticity enabled not only within intra-layer connections, but also in inter-layer pathways, is critical for memory consolidation and energetic downshift. Compared to restricted plasticity, full inter-layer plasticity yields higher post-sleep visual classification accuracy and promotes the emergence of sharper class-specific associations. Furthermore, we introduce a biophysically grounded estimator of metabolic power expressing network energy consumption in ATP units, partitioned into baseline, synaptic maintenance, action potential, and transmission costs. We find that inter-layer plasticity in sleep leads to a larger reduction in firing rates, synaptic strength and synaptic activity, corresponding to a substantially larger decrease in power consumption. This work suggests promising elements to be integrated in neuromorphic/energy-efficient AI learning systems, supported by brain state-specific apical mechanisms.",

Using rare simultaneous single-neuron recordings across multiple human brain regions, we show that representations in ventral temporal cortex (VTC), not traditionally associated with context-dependent coding, are dynamically reconfigured by the timing of task instructions. Identical visual stimuli evoked distinct responses in VTC depending on when task instructions were provided, with categorical representations sharpened when goals were specified in advance. In contrast, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and hippocampus carried strong signals related to instruction timing, consistent with known regional specialization in top-down control. Coupling between dACC and VTC increased with uncertainty and for high cognitive demand, and its strength predicted correct performance. These findings uncover a dynamic feedback mechanism through which medial frontal cortex reorganizes sensory population codes in VTC, linking flexible cortical coordination to successful goal-directed computation.",

    "content": "The dentate gyrus is a major locus for structural and synaptic reorganization in temporal lobe epilepsy. While physiological changes during epileptogensis are well characterized in the principal dentate projection neuron, granule cells (GCs), epilepsy-related changes in semilunar granule cells (SGCs), a distinct subset of dentate projection neurons, remain unknown. Using a mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy, we show that, unlike GCs, SGCs exhibit an increase in intrinsic excitability 1 week after status epilepticus (SE), accompanied by a depolarized resting membrane potential in epileptic mice 1-month post-SE. Both GCs and SGCs display increased frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in early post-SE and epileptic mice. However, only SGCs received more frequent spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and exhibited smaller afferent-evoked IPSCs early after SE. Additionally, evoked EPSC amplitude in SGCs was reduced in epileptic mice. Behaviorally, epileptic mice showed impairments in their ability to use spatial search strategies in a Barnes maze paradigm. Epileptic TRAP::tdT mice showed reduced activity dependent neuronal ensemble labeling, with fewer tdT-labeled neurons in both task-naive and trained conditions and reduced c-Fos co-expression following task re-acquisition compared to controls. Notably, the proportion of SGCs within labeled ensembles was reduced in task-naive epileptic mice but not in trained animals. Collectively, our findings identify selective changes in SGC intrinsic excitability during epileptogenesis that could contribute to enhanced network excitability.

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

    "title": "When Randomness Becomes Rigid: Dynamic Connectivity Entropy and Symptom-Linked Network Dysfunction in Schizophrenia",
    "content": "High dimensionality of dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC) data representation complicates clinical interpretation and biomarker discovery. We propose a new complementary analytical framework based on dynamic inter-network connectivity entropy (DICE) and its potential use as a biomarker of mental illness. Our framework shows that DICE features extend beyond patient-control discrimination, revealing distinct pathophysiological signatures and differential associations with symptom dimensions. Using resting-state fMRI data from 311 participants, 160 controls, 151 schizophrenia (SZ) patients, we identified 53 intrinsic networks, computed DICE and derived three families of DICE-based metrics: (i) entropy level and range, (ii) distributional shape and temporal organization, (iii) entropy-state repertoire and occupancy. These measures revealed a multidimensional signature of altered entropy dynamics in SZ: (1) elevated baseline entropy with reduced fluctuation magnitude and reduced entropy acceleration; (2) reduced temporal persistence of entropy excursions and entropy distributions closer to Gaussian; and (3) a narrowed repertoire of entropy states, prolonged time in near-baseline entropy configurations. The DICE-based metrics within the SZ group show different associations with symptom dimensions. Reduced fluctuation magnitude and acceleration were associated with greater PANSS general symptom severity (disturbance of volition and preoccupation). Reduced deviation from Gaussianity was associated with higher PANSS positive severity (delusions and hallucinations). Reduced temporal persistence was associated with multiple PANSS positive, negative, and general symptoms. Reduced entropy-state diversity and prolonged dwell time in near-baseline states were associated with depression and PANSS positive/general severity, respectively. The multidimensional pathophysiology revealed through the different entropy patterns may potentially guide biomarker development and personalized treatments.",

    "title": "Pulsed taVNS-elicited pupil dilation: effects of intermixed stimulation, sham location and respiratory phase",
    "content": "Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) may offer a powerful, noninvasive way to stimulate activity of brainstem arousal systems, including the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Pulsed taVNS is known to elicit pupil dilation, a marker of LC activity. However, studies reporting taVNS effects on pupil dilation have delivered taVNS and sham stimulation in separate blocks of trials or in separate sessions, hindering the integration of taVNS into rapid, event-related task designs of cognitive neuroscientists. In two experiments, we examined the effectiveness of pulsed taVNS in eliciting pupil dilation when active and sham stimulation were intermixed within the same blocks of trials, and whether these effects depend on sham location and respiratory phase. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), intermixed taVNS and (earlobe) sham pulses of 3.4 seconds produced inconclusive evidence for increased taVNS-evoked pupil dilation. In contrast, in Experiment 2 (N = 60), taVNS pulses of 1.0 seconds had a strong effect on pupil dilation, but only in a group of participants that received sham stimulation at the earlobe; this effect was abolished in a group that received sham stimulation at the upper scapha, a non-vagal control area with a similar density of sympathetic nerve fibers as the cymba concha. Furthermore, taVNS-evoked pupil dilation was not enhanced when stimulation was delivered during exhalation, as would be expected if pupil effects were mediated by the vagus nerve-nucleus tractus solitarius-LC pathway. Together, these findings show that the effect of pulsed taVNS on pupil dilation can be preserved when taVNS and (earlobe) sham are delivered in the same blocks of trials. However, the null finding with the scapha as sham location, and the absence of an enhanced taVNS effect during exhalation call into question the assumption that taVNS-induced pupil dilation is mediated by activation of the vagal afferent pathway.",

    "title": "Effects of delay and amplification of auditory feedback for walking: anticipation, variability, and frequency adaptation.",
    "content": "When walking, we generate rich acoustic information through our footsteps. This sound stream contains information about footfall timing, dragging, loading rate, etc. The role of this endogenous auditory feedback in gait control remains underexplored. Building on work in delayed auditory feedback (DAF) for speech and on theories of sensorimotor coupling, we investigated whether manipulating the delay and amplification of self-produced footstep sounds modulates gait dynamics. Thirty healthy young adults walked overground while receiving real-time lateralized playback of the sound close to their feet using shoe-mounted microphones, belt-worn micro-computer, and headphones, all connected with cables for minimal latency. Across conditions, auditory feedback was delivered with no delay, low delay (12.5% step duration), or high delay (25% step duration), and at either full or half amplification. There was also a masked hearing condition with pink noise. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, namely cadence, speed, stride length, and coefficient of variation were analyzed as percent change relative to baseline. We found that amplification without delay reduced variability by almost 10% on average, consistent with strengthened sensorimotor coupling via enhanced perceptual access to foot-ground interaction dynamics. A second interesting finding was that delay increased the cadence of walking instead of reducing it, contrary to our expectations. We discussed how this effect can be explained by both Bayesian predictive coding and anticipatory dynamic systems with delayed feedback. We developed a theoretical model with anticipatory dynamics, with implications for closed-loop gait rehabilitation tools.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components.

    "title": "The effects of electrical stimulation on neurons and glia of the central nervous system",
    "content": "Objective. This review paper focuses on how both direct current (DC) stimulation and alternating current (AC) stimulation affects the central nervous system\u2019s (CNSs) cells and its potential as a neurotherapeutic. Furthermore, addressing the promise of combinatorial approaches that utilize other treatments alongside electrical stimulation (ES) and how ES has shaped clinical approaches as a new rehabilitation treatment. Approach. Authors conducted this review to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation; 124 manuscripts were identified through Google Scholar for insights into ES effects on neurons and glia in both in vitro and in vivo models. Main results. The review summarizes findings from DC and AC stimulation paradigms applied to in vitro or in vivo preclinical models and summarizes the promise of ES when applied clinically. Generally, DC stimulation promotes axonal extension towards the cathode, while axons retract at the anode, limiting regeneration. AC stimulation alternates electrode polarity, enabling axonal extension in both directions. The intensity and duration of ES significantly affects the extent of neurite outgrowth. For astrocytes and microglia, ES\u2014whether AC or DC\u2014downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting A2 or M2 reactive states conducive to regeneration, respectively. Regarding oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), both DC and AC stimulation enhance OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes, increasing myelin content and supporting axonal myelination. ES, when combined with stem cell treatments, drug delivery approaches, or with electroactive biomaterials, facilitate greater efficacy of these approaches. Clinically, short-single sessions of ES have shown long-term improvement. More specifically, preliminary efforts have been implemented to restore gait, hand tremors, and speech in spinal cord injuries, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and stroke patients, respectively. Significance. ES is an evolving neurotherapeutic strategy for CNS related disease or injuries. Understanding how ES modulates neurons and glia is critical for optimizing its application in the clinic.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "content": "IntroductionMeige syndrome is a rare adult-onset segmental dystonia characterized by blepharospasms and oromandibular dystonia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment, but it can lead to stimulation-induced dyskinesia (SID) in some patients. Refractory SID in Meige syndrome after STN-DBS is clinically challenging. We report a case of a Meige syndrome patient who developed refractory SID following STN-DBS and was successfully managed using a novel timed-stimulation programming strategy employing different contacts.Case descriptionA 47-year-old female with a two-year history of Meige syndrome developed refractory SID after the treatment of STN-DBS. Various programming strategies were attempted, including monopolar stimulation, interleaved stimulation, bipolar stimulation et al., but none achieved a balance between symptom control and SID. A novel approach involving timed alternation between ventral contacts (contacts 3 and 7) and dorsal contacts (contacts 4 and 8) was implemented. The stimulation was gradually programmed, the duration of ventral stimulation was increased while decreasing dorsal stimulation. Eventually, the patient achieved significant symptom improvement without SID. The reconstruction of the volume of tissue activated (VTA) revealed that this stimulation strategy likely modulates the neural circuits of pallidothalamic fibers (PTF) to suppress SID.ConclusionThis case demonstrates that this noval timed stimulation programming can effectively manage refractory SID in Meige syndrome patients, offering a viable alternative when conventional methods fail. The findings suggest that PTF stimulation plays a key role in SID suppression, and this strategy warrants further investigation in larger cohorts.",

    "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
    "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

    "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

Here we present an integrated software-hardware ecosystem for pose estimation that spans dataset creation, model training, offline analysis, and real-time deployment on embedded edge-computing devices. SqueakPose Studio provides a software suite for whole-frame, deep learning-based pose estimation that unifies dataset creation, manual and model-assisted labeling, model training, validation, and large-scale offline inference. The system leverages modern object-detection architectures to enable efficient end-to-end training and inference without patch-based sampling or multi-stage postprocessing, and supports execution on CPUs, GPUs, and Apple Silicon. For experimental settings requiring continuous recording and synchronized data acquisition, SqueakView enables real-time model deployment, video capture, and sensor logging on embedded edge-computing hardware, while MouseHouse provides a compact, modular enclosure designed for home cage-based experiments that integrates embedded GPU compute, microcontroller-based timing, and peripheral I/O. A shared data format and deterministic timing architecture ensure consistency across offline analysis and real-time deployment. Together, SqueakPose Studio, SqueakView, and MouseHouse provide a unified platform for pose estimation that supports both conventional offline analysis and embedded, real-time experimentation, without reliance on workstation-grade hardware or external middleware.",

    "title": "Predicting driver distraction using a single channel ear EEG",
    "content": "Cognitive distraction poses a major risk to driving safety, yet remains difficult to detect in real time because it often lacks overt behavioral markers. Neurophysiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) provide objective indices of cognitive load, but conventional EEG systems are impractical for real-world deployment due to their intrusiveness and computational demands. The present study examined whether cognitive distraction during naturalistic driving can be decoded using a single-channel, non-invasive in-ear EEG, and how its temporal dynamics compare with those obtained from full-cap scalp EEG and behavioral measures. Twenty-seven participants performed a dual-task paradigm in a highly immersive driving simulator, combining continuous vehicle control with low- and high-load arithmetic tasks presented on an in-vehicle display. Single-channel in-ear EEG, 24-channel scalp EEG, eye movements, and head rotation were recorded concurrently. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis was applied to decode working-memory load with millisecond precision across modalities. Cognitive distraction was reliably decoded from in-ear EEG, with detection latency and temporal generalization profiles closely matching those of full-cap scalp EEG. Although peak decoding performance was higher for scalp EEG, the timing and temporal stability of distraction-related neural signatures were largely overlapping between the two neural modalities. Eye velocity provided the earliest and most sensitive behavioral marker of distraction, while head rotation contributed complementary but weaker information. Scalp EEG topographies indicated that neural signals underlying decoding were closely linked to oculomotor and visuomotor processes engaged during task performance. These findings demonstrate that single-channel in-ear EEG provides a temporally precise and low-burden neural marker of cognitive distraction during driving. By prioritizing early detection and minimal hardware over maximal classification accuracy, the results identify a practical operating point for wearable EEG-based driver monitoring systems and support the feasibility of fast, off-the-shelf decoding approaches for real-world applications.",

    "title": "A Primary Central Source Determines Perturbation-Evoked N1 Amplitudes but not Latencies in Younger Adults",
    "content": "The balance perturbation-evoked N1 potential is a reliable cortical response during reactive balance control that is correlated to a variety of cognitive and motor functions. Although the supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the primary source of the N1, it is less understood whether other brain regions contribute to N1 recorded at the scalp. We used source localization on electroencephalography (EEG) data from 25 younger adults recorded during backward whole-body perturbations during stance. We identified the sources that contribute to channel-based N1 recordings and quantified their impact on N1 amplitude and latency. In younger adults, N1 amplitudes can be explained by one single source in a central midline cortical region covering the SMA. When reconstructing N1 signals using backprojections with one versus all independent components (IC) identified as brain sources there was no difference in peak amplitudes and a small but significant difference in N1 peak latencies. Parallel brain sources thus deflect the time course of the N1, but not its magnitude. Brain areas associated with IC's contributing to the shift in N1 latency varied between participants. Our results emphasize the dominant influence of central cortical areas on the N1 response, informing hypothesizes regarding the nature of the signal and its functional role. Importantly, the extent and location of other cortical structures that influence N1 timing, such as parietal cortex areas and the anterior cingulate cortex, may further elucidate cortical contributions to balance. These markers could be crucial for the early detection of balance problems in clinical populations.",

    "content": "Objective. Foundation models have demonstrated transformative potential in medical artificial intelligence but remain underexplored in functional neuroimaging, particularly magnetoencephalography (MEG). This study aims to develop a domain-specific, self-supervised MEG clinical foundation model tailored for headache disorders to address the challenges of high-dimensional data and limited labeled datasets in clinical research. Approach. We developed a transformer-based model pretrained on a large-scale dataset comprising multi-state MEG recordings (resting-state, auditory, and somatosensory stimulation) from 416 participants (362 headache patients and 54 healthy controls). The model utilized a self-supervised masked-signal reconstruction strategy to learn latent spatiotemporal representations of neural activity. We evaluated the model\u2019s performance through signal reconstruction, visualization of attention weights, and downstream classification tasks comparing model-derived features against original MEG signals for migraine diagnosis. Main results. The pretrained model successfully reconstructed both continuous MEG signals and stimulus-specific evoked responses, effectively capturing intrinsic spatiotemporal brain dynamics. Visualization of the model\u2019s attention weights demonstrated spatial alignment with corresponding sensory brain regions, confirming its neurophysiological interpretability. Furthermore, classifiers trained on features extracted from the pretrained model significantly outperformed those using original MEG signals in identifying migraine patients, revealing distinct neural response patterns. Significance. This study introduces a scalable, data-efficient framework for clinical MEG analysis that significantly reduces reliance on manual feature extraction and labeled data. It demonstrates the efficacy of foundation models in decoding complex neural dynamics, offering promising implications for understanding neuropathology and facilitating precision diagnostics in neurology.",

    "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings.

Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

    "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

    "title": "Temporal Phase Differences Encode Tactile Motion from Static Vibrotactile Inputs",
    "content": "Motion perception in touch is traditionally attributed to spatially sequential stimulation or skin deformation caused by moving objects. Here, we demonstrate that directional tactile motion can instead be inferred purely from temporal phase differences between two spatially static vibrotactile inputs. Using psychophysical experiments in human participants (n = 54), we show that continuous vibrations delivered to separate fingertips, when offset in phase, evoke a robust and directionally consistent motion percept despite the absence of physical movement. Discrimination performance depended systematically on the temporal phase relationship between stimuli, following a sinusoidal relationship, consistent with a phase-based motion inference mechanism. Vibration amplitude had little influence on perceptual accuracy once stimuli exceeded detection threshold, although higher amplitudes modestly reduced response times. In contrast, envelope dynamics and spatial configuration significantly modulated performance: vibrations with exponential amplitude envelopes - reflecting the natural propagation of mechanical energy through a medium - enhanced phase sensitivity and sped responses, and bimanual stimulation across the two hands improved both accuracy and response time. These findings identify temporal phase integration as a fundamental mechanism for tactile motion perception, analogous to timing-based computations in auditory localisation and visual motion detection. Phase-coded vibrotactile stimulation therefore offers a minimal and efficient strategy for conveying directional motion in haptic interfaces without requiring spatial arrays or moving actuators.",

    "title": "Transcriptomic profiling reveals neurophysiological gene candidates underlying vocal evolution in African clawed frogs",
    "content": "Neurophysiologists have discovered many mechanisms underlying the production of animal behaviors in specific species; these involve a collection of neuromuscular systems, neuronal membrane and neural network properties, as well as the hormones and neuromodulators known to modify them. However, the mechanistic basis of behavioral evolution is less well-studied, and causal links between differences in gene expression, cellular mechanisms and species-typical behaviors are rare. Vertebrate vocal behaviors are an excellent system for studying the evolution of behaviors because they are ancient, diverse and readily quantifiable. Xenopus frogs are particularly well-suited to the study of vocal evolution due to the temporal diversity of male advertisement calls between closely related species and the well-described vocal pattern generating circuitry. Here we focus on two species, X. laevis and X. petersii, that diverged 8.5 million years ago and produce advertisement calls with distinct timing. To begin bridging the gap between behavioral and mechanistic diversity in Xenopus vocal behaviors, we performed RNA sequencing of the parabrachial nucleus, a vocal premotor hindbrain area known to encode species-typical temporal patterns in X. laevis and X. petersii. We identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes between the two species, including many genes related to hormone signaling, neuromodulation, neuronal and synaptic functions, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. We explore several testable hypotheses emerging from these results that may explain mechanisms by which candidate genes and gene families may contribute to vocal pattern differences between X. laevis and X. petersii.",

    "title": "Opening the black box: a modular approach to spike sorting",
    "content": "Spike sorting is an algorithmic process to extract the activity of individual neurons from extracellular electrophysiology recordings. With the ballooning use of high density probes, such as Neuropixels, this essential processing step is increasingly becoming time consuming and computationally expensive. Although many software tools have been proposed to address spike sorting, they are usually constructed and benchmarked as monolithic 'black boxes', making it difficult to factor out the effects of individual algorithmic steps on the final outcome, especially when varying datasets and parameters. To address this issue, we developed a modular and common framework to develop, benchmark, and assemble the key computational steps that are used in state-of-the-art spike sorting algorithms. Relying on fast and efficient ground truth generation of biophysically plausible recordings, we show that we are able to individually benchmark and precisely quantify the performance of different steps in a spike sorting pipeline (peak detection, feature extraction and clustering, and template matching). We then leverage these results to create a modular component-based spike sorters that can outperform Kilosort4 on large and dense simulated recordings. In addition, we find that the major bottleneck of all modern spike sorting pipelines is in the physical motion of probes, regardless of the drift-correction strategy. The presented component-based spike sorting framework has the potential to foster community engagement in the field by lowering the barrier to contributions, and provides a flexible yet powerful framework to construct end-to-end spike sorting solutions.",

    "content": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by early tau pathology in subcortical neuromodulatory nuclei, followed by progressive cortical tau accumulation; however, the mechanisms linking subcortical dysfunction to cortical tau pathology remain unclear. Using multimodal neuroimaging data from the ADNI cohort, we examined how infra-slow (< 0.1 Hz) global brain (i.e., gBOLD) activity is related to the volume of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) and cortical tau accumulations in the early stages of AD. NbM degeneration was associated with reduced gBOLD activity and spatially co-localized tau accumulation, appearing in early Braak regions during the preclinical stage, i.e., cognitively unimpaired participants with abnormal CSF markers, and extending to more advanced Braak areas during the prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. Our findings suggest that infra-slow gBOLD activity serves as a functional neural mediator linking subcortical degeneration to cortical tau pathology, highlighting a potential functional pathway linking subcortical and cortical pathology in early AD.",

    "content": "Multimodal data fusion is a powerful technique for extracting shared and complementary information about the brain that is captured across neuroimaging modalities. Independent component analysis (ICA)-based approaches are among the most widely utilized methods for multimodal fusion, as they are data-driven, robust to noise, and capable of identifying complex, hidden linkages of varying strengths across high-dimensional datasets. However, the data-driven nature of ICA fusion approaches can make comparisons across analyses difficult without a normative framework in place. In this work, we utilize resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) scans from >15,000 subjects to generate a normative model of multimodal structure-function linkages that can be used as a template to guide ICA fusions of new datasets. When applying this template in two datasets, resultant components exhibit high correspondence to the template even in small sample sizes, and subject-level loadings from template-derived ICs show significant associations to age.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Post-Decision Outcome Expectation and Evaluation in Human Sensorimotor Choice Behavior",
    "content": "The concept of embodied sensorimotor decision-making proposes that processes implicated in evaluating sensory inputs and selecting appropriate motor actions unfold partly in cortical regions traditionally associated with movement planning and execution. Reinforcement learning models emphasize the role of reward prediction error (RPE) in optimizing action selection based on decision outcome feedback. However, most evidence for the existence of RPE signals locates them in midline frontal and parietal cortex, and comes from tasks with externally manipulated reward probabilities that create artificial prediction errors. Whether RPE signals are expressed in human cortical motor areas during deterministic (non-probabilistic) tasks remains unclear, and would provide further support for embodied decision-making. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study post-decision neural dynamics in a color discrimination task in selected cortical regions of interest (ROIs). Participants had to press buttons with their left or right index finger in response to checkerboard stimuli with different levels of color evidence for the correct choice. Outcomes were fully determined by participants' choices. Delayed auditory feedback veridically indicated whether their hand choice was correct or not. We observed a robust beta-band (15-29 Hz) rebound after correct outcome feedback, strongest in ventral and dorsal premotor, anterior cingulate and superior parietal ROIs as well as occipital and auditory ROIs, and weakest in the primary motor and somatosensory ROIs. Critically, the rebound magnitude after correct feedback scaled inversely with color evidence strength and associated decision error rates. It was minimal in strong-evidence trials (~0.1% errors) and maximal in weak-evidence trials (~34% errors), resembling a context-sensitive positive RPE signal that was strongest when a correct outcome was least expected. Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) post-feedback rebound increases in weak evidence trials were not as strong as in the beta band and appeared mainly in occipital, superior parietal and posterior cingulate ROIs. After the decision but before feedback, both beta and alpha band power showed sensitivity to the level of sensory evidence on which the decisions had been based, with reduced post-movement rebound or enhanced suppression in trials with weak evidence, suggestive of internally generated outcome expectations. Pre-feedback alpha rebound suppression was strongest in occipital, superior parietal and posterior cingulate ROIs. Pre-feedback beta rebound suppression was not as strong. Together, these findings reveal distinct beta- and alpha-band dynamics that reflect internal pre-feedback outcome expectations and feedback-driven RPE-like outcome assessments. They support distributed cortical mechanisms, including premotor, parietal and cingulate regions, in reward expectation, outcome evaluation, and adaptive control, highlighting a role for motor and associative cortices in embodied decision-making, performance monitoring, and flexible behavior under uncertainty.",

To better investigate the causes and progression of the disease, the transgenic TgF344-AD rat model has emerged as a crucial tool. In this paper, we collect observations on the accumulation of amyloid-{beta}, changes in neuronal density, and a decline in cognitive performance in TgF344-AD and wild-type rats. We develop a compartmental ordinary differential equation model and determine its parameters by fitting the output to the experimental observations. Our model simulations support the hypothesis that the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} leads to a rapid decline in neuronal density followed by a significant loss in memory and learning ability. Our mathematical model can provide a bridge between AD research in rodent models and the human condition of AD.",

    "title": "A Population Vector Model of Visual Working Memory for Real-World Scenes",
    "content": "Visual working memory is essential for navigating through and interacting with complex real-world environments. It is therefore important to understand how natural visual inputs - characterized by complex contours, continuously varying feature gradients, and spatial relationships - are represented in working memory. However, most research in this field has focused on simplified arrays of discrete artificial objects, favoring experimental control and modeling simplicity over ecological validity. This has led to quantitative models of working memory that require inputs consisting of easily parsed objects defined by a single value along one or more simple feature dimensions. It is not clear how these models could be updated to represent complex, photograph-like scenes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a population vector model of working memory that was designed specifically for real-world scenes. This model represents a scene as a noisy vector of neural firing rates across one or more areas of the ventral pathway, as estimated by a deep neural network model. We show that this model can account for both variations in behavioral performance and patterns of brain activity in tasks that require storing naturalistic scenes in working memory. These results demonstrate the viability of our general modeling approach, setting the stage for more sophisticated models that can fully account for the storage of real-world scenes in working memory.",

    "title": "History-dependent ephaptic interactions in paired olfactory receptor neurons",
    "content": "Olfactory sensing begins with the transduction of odors into receptor currents on the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In insects and many other arthropods, ORNs are grouped stereotypically in hair-like sensilla on the surface of olfactory organs, enabling mutual inhibition through non-synaptic 'ephaptic' interactions (NSIs). Given the electrical, and therefore virtually instantaneous, nature of NSIs, it has been hypothesized that they contribute to processing fast temporal elements of mixed odor plumes. Here, we present single sensillum recordings and computational modeling that characterize NSIs during short offset dual-odor stimulations in the olfactory sensilla of adult female Drosophila melanogaster. We find in the experiments that the magnitude of inhibition between co-housed ORNs cannot be predicted by their instantaneous activity (firing rate) alone. It is adaptation-dependent, with strong effects only occurring when the inhibited ORN is adapted. This limits the usefulness of NSIs for fast odor processing when ORNs lack time to adapt. We reproduced the observed phenomena in a computational model and use this model to explain how the adaptation-dependence of NSI-mediated inhibition arises from nonlinearities in neural responses. We conclude that NSIs are unlikely to support the encoding of fast temporal dynamics in mixed odor stimuli, instead contributing to slower peripheral processing, supporting roles such as novelty detection. More broadly, we demonstrate how the nonlinear interactions of fairly simple electrical components lead to non-intuitive results, offering insight into the longstanding debate around ephaptic interactions in other systems, such as the mammalian CNS.",

    "content": "<p>Hey! I'm eshaan and I'm building Ourguide -an on-screen task guidance system that can show you where to click step-by-step when you need help.<p>I started building this because whenever I didn\u2019t know how to do something on my computer, I found myself constantly tabbing between chatbots and the app, pasting screenshots, and asking \u201cwhat do I do next?\u201d Ourguide solves this with two modes. In Guide mode, the app overlays your screen and highlights the specific element to click next, eliminating the need to leave your current window. There is also Ask mode, which is a vision-integrated chat that captures your screen context\u2014which you can toggle on and off anytime -so you can ask, \"How do I fix this error?\" without having to explain what \"this\" is.<p>It\u2019s an Electron app that works OS-wide, is vision-based, and isn't restricted to the browser.<p>Figuring out how to show the user where to click was the hardest part of the process. I originally trained a computer vision model with 2300 screenshots to identify and segment all UI elements on a screen and used a VLM to find the correct icon to highlight. While this worked extremely well\u2014better than SOTA grounding models like UI Tars\u2014the latency was just too high. I'll be making that CV+VLM pipeline OSS soon, but for now, I\u2019ve resorted to a simpler implementation that achieves <1s latency.<p>You may ask: if I can show you where to click, why can't I just click too? While trying to build computer-use agents during my job in Palo Alto, I hit the core limitation of today\u2019s computer-use models where benchmarks hover in the mid-50% range (OSWorld). VLMs often know what to do but not what it looks like; without reliable visual grounding, agents misclick and stall. So, I built computer use\u2014without the \"use.\" It provides the visual grounding of an agent but keeps the human in the loop for the actual execution to prevent misclicks.<p>I personally use it for the AWS Console's \"treasure hunt\" UI, like creating a public S3 bucket with specific CORS rules. It\u2019s also been surprisingly helpful for non-technical tasks, like navigating obscure settings in Gradescope or Spotify. Ourguide really works for any task when you\u2019re stuck or don't know what to do.<p>You can download and test Ourguide here: <a href=\"https://ourguide.ai/downloads\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ourguide.ai/downloads</a><p>The project is still very early, and I\u2019d love your feedback on where it fails, where you think it worked well, and which specific niches you think Ourguide would be most helpful for.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46769422\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46769422</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "title": "Oculomotor dance learning task: Implications for audio-visual cued spatial learning",
    "content": "Learning dance of a motor sequence learning involves the coordination of both oculomotor and manual motor systems through the practiced repetition of a fixed sequence of actions, resulting in automatized execution of movement through habit learning. This study aims to address whether a sequence-based learning paradigm centered on the visual-motor system can feasibly be measured while listening to music (Bar and DeSouza 2016). It aims to develop a new visual-motor-based learning paradigm with music, potentially promoting neuroplasticity and creating new interventional tools, building upon prior research that shows behavioural and putative neural changes following dance-based neurorehabilitation in people with Parkinson's disease (Bearss et al. 2024). Eye movements of 10 participants (8 female, 2 male) were tracked using the Eyelink 1000 Plus system during a 68-second eye-dance sequence. The experiment consisted of a learning phase, where participants observed the sequence five times with 30-second breaks, and a performance phase, where they performed the sequence five times from memory on a grey screen without visual cues. Music was incorporated into both phases to aid memorization of the 4 spatial locations. After each performance, the participant was shown a visual reinforcer and asked for their thoughts on how well they executed the dance. A visual reinforcer flashes one of three different colours: red, yellow, or green. Each colour corresponds to how many steps in the dance a participant performed correctly, with key points being: under one third, between one to two thirds, and over two thirds of total steps correct. Participants were scored based on timing of the steps as well for exact (1.00), good (0.66), slightly off (0.33) or missed (0) steps. Data was analyzed using R4.3.1, MATLAB, and Experiment Builder: Data Viewer software. Results showed a significant improvement in performance accuracy between the first session (g1; M = 40%, SD = 7.2%) and the last session (g5; M = 69.7%, SD = 22.8%). A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of session on performance accuracy, F(4, 36) = 6.99, p < 0.001, 2G = 0.26, indicating that accuracy significantly improved over sessions. Post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons showed that accuracy in later sessions was significantly higher than earlier sessions, suggesting a defined learning curve and consolidation of performance pattern across repeated practice. Similarly, there was significant improvement in timing accuracy between the first session g1; M = 0.29, SD = 0.06) and the fifth session (g5; M = 0.46, SD = 0.12). A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of session on timing precision, F(4, 36) = 11.67, p < 0.001, 2G = 0.25, indicating significant improvements in temporal control and coordination over sessions. Post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons showed that timing precision significantly improved between early and late sessions (e.g, g1-g4, p <0.01; g1-g5, p < 0.001), suggesting a defined learning curve and increase in precision across repeated practice. These findings suggest that visual-motor-based interventions have the potential to enhance motor and non-motor symptoms like depression and anxiety for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disorder (PD). The results provide a foundation for developing targeted therapies that integrate learning paradigms to improve functional outcomes, warranting further exploration of their long-term efficacy.",

    "title": "Impaired Associative Memory, Inference, and Theta Dynamics in Postictal Psychosis of Epilepsy",
    "content": "Postictal psychosis (PIP) is a severe complication occurring in 2% of people with epilepsy (PWE) whose underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Although historically considered separate from other forms of psychosis, newer evidence demonstrates a shared genetic susceptibility. People with schizophrenia are typically impaired at both associative learning and inferring connections between overlapping associations. Successful associative encoding, retrieval, and inference can each be predicted by changes in frontotemporal theta band activity, which is impaired in rodent models and people with schizophrenia. Here, we recorded high-density scalp EEG from PWE with history of PIP and well-matched control participants while they undertook a memory inference task. We found that associative memory and inference were both impaired in the PIP group, despite no difference in item recognition. Moreover, we found disrupted theta activity during memory encoding and the retrieval of inferred associations in PWE with PIP that likely originated from the medial temporal and frontal lobes. These results suggest a pattern of behavioural deficits and altered neural dynamics common to both PIP and schizophrenia. Interpreted in conjunction with previous genetic studies, they may reflect shared neural mechanisms contributing to psychopathology in both conditions and argue that PIP is a model of more general psychoses.",

    "title": "Systemic AAV delivery of a calcium indicator in marmosets: functional validation in visual area MT",
    "content": "Functional optical imaging in nonhuman primates provides an important complement to electrophysiological approaches in neuroscience research, but its broader use has been limited by challenges in achieving large-scale, homogeneous expression of genetically encoded reporters, and imaging accessibility in species with gyrencephalic brains with sulci and fissures (e.g., rhesus macaques). Specifically, conventional local intracortical viral injections are invasive and often produce spatially restricted or heterogeneous expression, constraining population-level analyses. Here, we show that systemic intravenous delivery of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid engineered for enhanced blood-brain barrier crossing, AAV.CAP-B10, supports robust and widespread expression of a calcium indicator CAaMP8s in the common marmoset. Intravenous delivery in two marmosets resulted in widespread cortical expression. Using a large cranial window over extrastriate visual area MT (and its satellite areas), we performed widefield single-photon imaging and two-photon cellular-resolution imaging in awake,behaving marmosets to functionally validate activity in this well studied primate visual-motion sensitive cortical area. Population level responses to visual motion and spatial organization measured with widefield imaging, as well as single-cell level motion direction tuning measured with two-photon imaging, were consistent with canonical properties of MT reported in previous electrophysiological studies. Quantitative analyses of lightsheet imaging after whole hemisphere brain clearing further confirmed the broad expression of GCaMP in both cortical and subcortical areas. Together, these results indicate that systemic delivery using AAV.CAP-B10 provides a minimally invasive approach for robust multi-scale functional optical imaging in awake, behaving marmosets.",

    "title": "Temporal Dynamics of EEG Decoding for Continuously Changing Visual Stimuli",
    "content": "Multivariate analyses of M/EEG data are typically performed on neural responses time-locked to discrete stimulus onsets. Such designs usually reveal high decoding performance during the initial transient response (0-500 ms), which subsequently drops to a lower, sustained level. Here, we examined time-resolved EEG decoding of natural scene processing when scenes gradually enter the visual field without a clear onset. We created video sequences in which one scene category (e.g., a beach) smoothly transitioned into another category (e.g., a forest) by blending images from two categories into a single composite panorama and moving a square aperture across it. We then compared EEG decoding for the first scenes within the transitions, which appeared with a sudden onset, to the second scenes, which emerged gradually as the videos progressed. For the first scenes, we observed robust category decoding from 60 ms after onset with a clear peak structure. For the second scene, category decoding was markedly weaker and showed no discernable peak structure. Realigning the appearance of category-diagnostic content for the second scene using deep neural networks did not enhance decoding or recover a peak structure. Further, classifiers trained on the first scene generalized to the second, but with a broad, temporally diffuse pattern, indicating that the second scene did not engage the same hierarchical temporal cascade as the first. Together, these results demonstrate that sudden versus gradual onsets produce distinct temporal decoding dynamics. Insights from onset-based decoding studies, therefore, do not straightforwardly extend to continuous and free-flowing natural stimulation.",

    "title": "Csf1r-mediated depletion of midbrain microglia prevents dopaminergic neuron loss during chronic colitis",
    "content": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predisposes to neuropsychiatric comorbidity and particularly increases the risk of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in later life. Although the gut-immune-brain axis was proposed as a link between IBD and PD and a driver of PD immunopathogenesis, the regional pattern and single-cell landscape of the brain immune response during colitis and its contribution to PD pathology remain poorly defined. Here, we observe a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of adult mice with chronic colitis. By confocal microscopy and integrated multi-omics, we reveal a complex midbrain-centered immune response to chronic colitis in comparison to the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Single-cell mapping of the midbrain immune landscape showed an inflammatory shift of microglial clusters including an expansion of interferon-response microglia, CD8+ T cell extravasation, and increased numbers of vessel-associated neutrophils. Selective myeloid cell depletion using a colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) inhibitor after colitis onset reduced midbrain microglia by 67% and led to a complete rescue of dopaminergic neuron loss, without affecting mucosal pathology or T cell and neutrophil migration to the midbrain. Collectively, within the complex innate and adaptive midbrain immune response to chronic colitis, we demonstrate a causal role of Csf1r-dependent microglia for dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Thus, Csf1r inhibition in IBD may not locally ameliorate colitis, but provide neuroprotection to dopaminergic neurons. These results reveal a novel cellular link between chronic gut-derived peripheral inflammation and midbrain vulnerability and thereby substantially enhance our understanding of the risk for PD related to the gut-immune-brain axis.",

    "title": "Can category-selective cortex predict categorisation behaviour?",
    "content": "One of the distinctive features of the human visual system is the presence in occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) of regions that show preferential activation to specific categories of visual objects. To understand how this selectivity relates to categorisation behaviour, studies have employed a distance-to-bound approach (DTB), where multivariate brain activity is used to estimate a decision boundary, from which behavioural performance can be predicted. Using this approach, correlations have been found between activity in OTC, and behavioural performance when carrying out certain categorisation tasks. However, it remains unclear what determines where in OTC this correlations can be found, and with which categorisation tasks they can be found. Here, we bridged this gap by relating category selective regions of OTC, to behavioural performance while participants categorised images as belonging or not to their preferred categories. We adopted a more basic approach and considered simple, univariate activity, rather than relying on decoding to build our DTB. Our results show that activation in regions selective to faces (FFA & OFA), bodies (EBA), and scenes (PPA), is sufficient to predict behavioural performance while categorising images as being faces, bodies, or scenes, respectively. These results are largely consistent across reaction time and motor movements, and generalise to animacy classification. Overall, our data adds to evidence that category-selective regions in OTC can serve to guide categorisation behaviour, and underlines the validity of the DTB approach to address this relationship.",

    "title": "Subcortex visualization: A toolbox for custom data visualization in the subcortex and cerebellum",
    "content": "Recent years have seen an expanding repertoire of code-based tools for visualizing neuroimaging data, promoting reproducibility and interpretability of brain-mapping findings. However, most open-source visualization packages for the human brain are geared toward the cerebral cortex, and the comparatively few options for the subcortex and cerebellum are limited in scope (i.e., atlas support) and flexibility. We address this critical gap by introducing subcortex_visualization, an open-source package offered in both Python and R, that provides a unified and accessible framework for programmatically visualizing non-cortical data across many popular subcortical and cerebellar parcellation atlases. These visuals are inspired by the ggseg R package for cortical data, which implements standardized rendering conventions to facilitate comparison across atlases in a vectorized two-dimensional format. In addition to the vectorized versions of nine subcortical and cerebellar atlases--to our knowledge, the most comprehensive collection of non-cortical atlases in a single visualization toolbox--we also provide a step-by-step tutorial for users to generate custom vector-based visualizations from any given brain segmentation, enabling flexible extension to new atlases and structures. Collectively, subcortex_visualization and the accompanying documentation support reproducible and interpretable visualization of neuroimaging data below the cortical mantle.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I am writing a blog series on implementing real-time recommender systems. Part 1 covers the theoretical implementation and prototyping of a Contextual Bandit system.</p> <p><strong>Contextual Bandits</strong> optimize recommendations by considering the current &quot;state&quot; (context) of the user and the item. Unlike standard A/B testing or global popularity models, bandits update their internal confidence bounds after every interaction. This allows the system to learn distinct preferences for different contexts (e.g., Morning vs. Evening) without waiting for a daily retraining job.</p> <p>In Part 1, I discuss:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Constructing context vectors that combine static user attributes with dynamic event features (e.g., timestamps), alongside item embeddings.</li> <li><strong>Offline Policy Evaluation:</strong> Benchmarking algorithms like LinUCB against Random and Popularity baselines using historical logs to validate ranking logic.</li> <li><strong>Simulation Loop:</strong> Implementing a local feedback loop to demonstrate how the model &quot;reverse-engineers&quot; hidden logic, such as time-based purchasing habits.</li> </ul> <p>Looking Ahead:</p> <p>This prototype lays the groundwork for Part 2, where I will discuss scaling this logic using an Event-Driven Architecture with Flink, Kafka, and Redis.</p> <p>Link to Post: <a href=\"https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2026-01-29-prototype-recommender-with-python/\">https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2026-01-29-prototype-recommender-with-python/</a></p> <p>I welcome any feedback on the product recommender.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jaehyeon-kim\"> /u/jaehyeon-kim </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qncckp/prototyping_a_realtime_product_recommender_using/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qncckp/prototyping_a_realtime_product_recommender_using/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Computational reconstruction of evolutionary selection in human brain networks",
    "content": "IntroductionThe accumulation of genomic and brain data opens new opportunities for resource friendly, data driven brain exploration. A key challenge is to develop versatile and accessible strategies that integrate and mine multimodal datasets for novel neuroscientific insights. Here, we optimized an integrated workflow for mapping multigenic evolutionary traits in the human brain across cognitive, cellular, and molecular levels.MethodsAt the input stage, the workflow fuses an evolutionary genetic dataset with searchable synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) databases that are pre clustered into concise psychological domains for improved interpretability. At its core, a Genetic Algorithm for Generalized Biclustering (GABi) mines gene sets under evolutionary selection that also show high expression correlation with fMRI networks.ResultsApplying this workflow, we identified evolutionary patterns spanning cognitive traits, brain cell types, and molecular mechanisms. Focusing on socio affective traits, the algorithm highlighted peaks in adaptive selection in networks for social interaction (language) and social concepts (theory of mind) across hominid, early hominin, and anatomically modern human (AMH) ancestry. These traits emerge from a broad spectrum of excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neuronal, as well as non neuronal, cell types. The associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched for cell signaling, synaptic organization, and neuronal morphology.DiscussionTogether, these findings demonstrate an integrated workflow for molecular to systems level exploration of the brain and provide new perspectives on the evolutionary history of human socio affective functions. This approach can be adapted to screen for functional traits in the context of mental disorders or applied to the brains of other phylogenies in a similar manner.",

    "title": "Diagnostically competitive performance of a physiology-informed generative multi-task network for contrast-free CT perfusion",
    "content": "Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment. While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood flow in the brain. However, CTP can be expensive with limited accessibility, and the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic reactions and adverse side effects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall, MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.",

    "title": "Biomarkers Identifying Tendency to Suicide (BITS): detection of biomarkers in adolescents with suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior for early prevention or intervention. A prospective cohort study",
    "content": "Adolescent suicidality represents a major and persistent public health concern, with sustained increases in suicidal ideation and behaviors observed in recent years. Although suicide risk is widely conceptualized as a complex and multifactorial phenomenon, biological vulnerability factors remain insufficiently integrated into adolescent clinical assessment frameworks. In particular, neuroinflammatory processes, hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, and alterations in blood-brain barrier integrity have emerged as potentially relevant but underexplored contributors to suicidality. This prospective clinical cohort study adopts an integrative, multi-method approach to enhance the characterization of suicidality among help-seeking adolescents. We hypothesize that adolescents with suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviors will show distinct peripheral biomarker profiles compared with adolescents without suicidal concerns. The primary analyses focus on group differences at baseline in inflammatory cytokines, markers of systemic inflammation, HPA-axis activity, and blood-brain barrier-related biomarkers, as well as measures of suicidality severity and global functioning. Secondary outcomes include associations between biomarker levels and psychopathological severity and functioning, and longitudinal changes in biological and clinical measures, including transitions in suicidality status, over a 2-month follow-up. Participants will undergo a comprehensive psychodiagnostic assessment and standardized peripheral blood sampling at baseline and follow-up. By integrating biological measures with detailed psychological and behavioral profiling within a longitudinal design, this protocol aims to establish a framework for biomarker-informed risk stratification of high-risk adolescents, ultimately informing more precise and developmentally sensitive suicide prevention strategies.",

    "content": "IntroductionResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a widely used non-invasive technique for investigating brain function and identifying potential disease biomarkers. Compared with task-based fMRI, rs-fMRI is easier to acquire because it does not require explicit task paradigms. However, functional connectivity measures derived from rs-fMRI often exhibit poor reliability, which substantially limits their clinical applicability.MethodsTo address this limitation, we propose a novel method termed time-enhanced functional connectivity, which improves reliability by identifying and removing poor-quality time points from rs-fMRI time series. This approach aims to enhance the quality of functional connectivity estimation without extending scan duration or relying on dataset-specific constraints.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves performance in downstream machine learning tasks, such as sex classification. In addition, time-enhanced functional connectivity yields higher test\u2013retest reliability and reveals more pronounced statistical differences between groups compared with conventional functional connectivity measures.DiscussionThese findings suggest that selectively removing low-quality time points provides a practical and effective strategy for improving the reliability and sensitivity of functional connectivity measurements in rs-fMRI, thereby enhancing their potential utility in both neuroscience research and clinical applications.",

    "content": "Background/objectivesThe existing literature on normative data for accommodative facility (AF) in African populations is limited to high school students. There is no normative data for vergence facility (VF) in African children, so there are no benchmarks for comparison in case analysis, diagnosis, and management. The study aimed to establish normative data for AF in children aged 8\u201312\u202fyears. Additionally, the study sought to determine normative data for VF in children aged 8\u201317\u202fyears in the Cape Coast metropolis, Ghana.MethodsNormal children (510) were recruited through a comprehensive oculo-visual examination of 2,300 basic school-going children, aged 8\u201317\u202fyears. AF was measured with a\u202f\u00b1\u202f2D flipper lens for 1 min. VF was measured with a 3-base-in/12 base-out flipper prism for 1 min. Normative data were derived using the median with interquartile ranges (IQR) and considering the spread of data within the minimum and maximum ranges.ResultsA median value of 13 cpm with IQR of 4 cpm was determined for monocular accommodative facility (MAF). The normative central tendency for MAF for school children 8\u201317\u202fyears ranges from 9 to 17\u202fcpm; data were widely spread, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 20\u202fcpm. A median value of 13 cpm with IQR of 3 cpm was determined for the binocular accommodative facility (BAF). The normative central tendency for BAF for school children aged 8\u201317\u202fyears ranged from 9 to 14\u202fcpm; data were widely spread, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 20\u202fcpm. A median value of 14 cpm with IQR of 4 cpm was determined for VF. The normative central tendency for VF for school children 8\u201317\u202fyears ranged from 10 to 18\u202fcpm; data were widely spread, with a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 21\u202fcpm.ConclusionThe normative data apply only to similarly aged Ghanaian children and serve as standards for comparison to clinical data for MAF, BAF, and VF during case analysis.",

    "title": "Adolescent Social Isolation Facilitates Tau Spread in Raphe Nuclei Linking Depression and Hyperalgesia in Alzheimers Disease",
    "content": "Tau pathology in brainstem serotonergic circuits drives early neuropsychiatric dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD), yet mechanisms linking the exposome, particularly social stress exposures to depression and altered pain perception, remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adolescent social isolation, a critical psychosocial exposome factor and major trigger of depression, facilitates tau propagation in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and downstream raphe nuclei, producing both neuropsychiatric and pain-related sequelae. Tau[P301L] was transduced into the DRN of 30-day socially isolated or group housed C57BL/6J mice using AAV, with control mice receiving AAV-GFP. Four weeks post-transduction, anxiety, social behavior, and pain sensitivity were assessed, and phosphorylated tau (ptau) within the DRN and spread to the median raphe (MRN) and raphe magnus (RMg) serotonergic neurons were evaluated. Socially isolated tau[P301L] mice exhibited hyperlocomotion, anxiety-like behavior, social deficits and hyperalgesia. Histological analysis revealed elevated ptau within TPH2 neurons in the DRN and trans-synaptic tau spread to MRN and RMg, accompanied by reduced TPH2 and increased ptau at the downstream raphe nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed altered expression of Slc6a4 and Tgm2, a stress-responsive gene implicated in AD. These results indicate that DRN tau under social stress drives neuropsychiatric phenotypes, while tau spread to MRN and RMg disrupts serotonergic modulation of pain. This study provides the first evidence that adolescent stress promotes tau propagation within the raphe nuclei, linking early neuropsychiatric and pain-processing deficits to prodromal Alzheimers disease and identifying a critical pathway through which psychosocial exposome risk converges with tau pathology to enable early intervention.",

Here, we perform comprehensive multi-probe electrophysiological investigations in vivo in the Grin2a+/- preclinical model for schizophrenia and control animals, recording across ~45 brain regions spanning cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus. Mutants displayed distributed and graded alterations across regions, with prominent activity reductions in higher-order thalamus and cross-parameter alterations across prefrontal cortices, striatum, and hippocampus. Restoration of higher-order thalamic activity in mutants was sufficient to normalize alterations in connected prefrontal cortices and striatum and unexpectedly cascaded distally to hippocampus and sensory cortices. Thus, higher-order thalamus plays a pivotal role in schizophrenia pathophysiology and restoration of a single informed locus could present a potent therapeutic strategy.",

    "content": "Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD) causes severe speech comprehension deficits despite preserved cochlear function. Patients vary widely in their impairments, likely reflecting distinct pathophysiological mechanisms that current diagnostics cannot distinguish. A fundamental barrier to diagnosis is that standard speech tests take a one-size-fits-all approach - yielding aggregate intelligibility scores that average across phoneme categories, obscuring mechanism-specific patterns. We hypothesized that different ANSD mechanisms produce distinct phoneme-specific signatures that targeted testing could reveal. Using computational modeling of auditory nerve responses, we tested four mechanism types through three sequential experiments demonstrating that mechanism-specific encoding disruptions cascade into speech recognition failures that remain robust under noise. Brief consonants (flaps, stops) showed severe disruption while sustained vowels were relatively preserved - and critically, these category-specific patterns differed across mechanisms. Speech recognition models trained on ANSD-degraded neural representations developed compensation strategies that generalize to healthy signals, while the reverse failed completely, establishing a fundamental asymmetry: spectral compensation generalizes while temporal integration requires intact timing. These patterns persist under noise, where the same training that benefits healthy listeners harms ANSD listeners, explaining why ANSD patients struggle disproportionately in real-world listening conditions. The results suggest that phoneme-targeted testing - examining specific categories rather than using phonetically balanced materials - may enable mechanism-specific diagnosis and personalized intervention.",

    "title": "Patients with chronic ankle instability exhibit increased sensorimotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and superior temporal gyrus activation during single-leg stance: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study",
    "content": "IntroductionBalance deficits are associated with clinical manifestations in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI); however, evidence of cortical plasticity related to balance control remains insufficient. This study aimed to evaluate cortical activity and balance differences between patients with CAI and healthy individuals during single-leg stance, with or without vision, and to explore the correlations between brain blood flow signals and homeostatic function to elucidate the neurophysiological changes in balance control.MethodsThis cohort study involved 30 patients with CAI from a single hospital and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Cortical activity in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The activity ranges of the center of mass (COM), acceleration, and acceleration extremes were calculated using wearable inertial sensors. Moreover, scale assessments (visual analog scale, foot and ankle ability measure, and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool) and functional tests (classical balance, Y-balance, multi-directional reach tests, and timed up-and-go tests) were conducted.ResultsSignificant between-group effects were observed for the root mean square (RMS) centroid acceleration in the anteroposterior (AP) direction (F = 5.51, p = 0.02), whereas within- and between-group differences existed for RMS centroid acceleration in the mediolateral (ML) direction (F = 3.56, p = 0.03; F = 8.5, p = 0.004). Significant within- and between-group differences were identified for peak acceleration magnitude (Acc_max) \u2013AP (F = 7.85, p = 0.001; F = 11.83, p = 0.001) and Acc_max\u2013ML (F = 15.64, p = 0.0001; F = 5.06, p = 0.026). The oxyhemoglobin concentration change (\u0394HbO2) was significantly greater in patients with CAI than in healthy controls during single-leg stance; between-group differences were identified in the STG\u2013right cerebral hemisphere (R) (F = 10.25, p = 0.002), DLPFC\u2013R (F = 50.99, p = 0.001), SMC\u2013R (F = 27.48, p = 0.0001), STG\u2013left cerebral hemisphere (L) (F = 13.6, p = 0.0001), DLPFC\u2013L (F = 24.21, p = 0.0001), and SMC\u2013L (F = 29.75, p = 0.0001); within-group differences in the SMC\u2013L (F = 9.92, p = 0.0001); and interaction effects in the STG\u2013R (F = 5.73, p = 0.004). During right-leg stance with the eyes closed, RMS\u2013ML and Acc_max\u2013ML exhibited a high positive correlation with \u0394HbO2 in the STG\u2013L (RMS\u2013ML: p = 0.001, r = 0.72; Acc_max\u2013ML: p = 0.001, r = 0.74).ConclusionPatients with CAI exhibited lower balance ability and greater COM bias than healthy controls, with increased bilateral activation in brain regions, regardless of which limb was elevated; the results were more pronounced with vision inhibited. Enhanced brain activity was positively correlated with COM changes. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy and wearable inertial sensors can detect balance in patients with CAI.",

    "title": "Association between cortical auditory evoked potentials recorded directly through cochlear implants and post-implantation auditory and speech outcomes",
    "content": "IntroductionFollowing the demonstration of feasibility in recording electrically evoked cortical auditory evoked potentials (eCAEPs) directly via cochlear implants in both children and adults, the present(CIs), this study aimed to investigate the relationship between eCAEP waveform characteristics and auditory and speech performance among cochlear implant (CI) users. Additionally, the effects of age at implantation and current age on the latencies and amplitudes of the P1, N1, and P2 complex were evaluated, within the framework of developmental auditory cortical plasticity.MethodsThe study included 25 children (mean age 11.5 \u00b1 4 years) and 12 adults; (mean age 33.8 \u00b1 12.3 years), all bilaterally implanted with Advanced Bionics devices. Intracochlear eCAEPs were recorded from 33 implanted ears in children and 21 ears in adults. Recordings were obtained via the contralateral basal electrode (number 13) in response to brief (10 ms) electrical stimulation of the apical electrode of the stimulated CI while recordings were done via basal electrode number 13 of the contralateral recording CI referenced to the CI case. Each recording session lasted approximately 5 minutes. Children ranged in age from 2.7 to 16.7 years (mean: 11.5 \u00b1 4), and adults from 18.5 to 49.1 years (mean: 33.8 \u00b1 12.3). Age at implantation ranged from 0.5 to 8.1 years in children (mean: averaged 1.75 \u00b1 1.4), and from 1.6 to 43.6 years in adults (mean: for children and 23.5 \u00b1 16.6) years for adults. Speech and auditory performance were assessed using CAP, SIR, and monosyllabic word recognition in quiet and noise.ResultsReliable eCAEPs with all obligatory components were recorded in all ears. Children demonstrated significantly shorter P1-N1 latencies and larger amplitudes compared to the adult cohort in this study. Age at implantation was the strongest predictor of cortical latency, with earlier implantation correlating with shorter P1-N1 latencies. Most children exhibited age-appropriate P1 latencies comparable to normal-hearing peers, whereas only a few adults-those implanted in early childhood-showed similar patterns. In addition, adult responses frequently showed displayed a split P2 waveform, less prominent in children, possibly reflecting altered cortical integration. Notably, significant correlations were found between eCAEP latencies and speech perception scores, particularly in noise, suggesting functional relevance of cortical processing efficiency. Participants with higher CAP and SIR scores exhibited significantly shorter P1-N1 latencies.DiscussionThese findings provide near-field neurophysiological evidence supporting the critical role of sensitive periods in auditory cortical development. The results underscore the value of intracochlear eCAEPs as a neuroscience-based, objective biomarker of auditory cortical function and plasticity in CI users. This approach enables real-time monitoring of neuroplastic changes and offers a novel platform for translational auditory neuroscience in both pediatric and adult implant recipients.",

    "content": "AimThis study aimed to investigate the brain activity involved in visually evoked auditory response (vEAR) using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and explore the differences in connections between visual and auditory cortex.MethodsThirty-seven subjects with vEAR and Thirty four subjects without vEAR, matched by age and gender, were recruited. The hearing threshold, years of education, and the Trail Making Test (versions A and B) results were collected from all patients. All participants underwent a 256-channel EEG, and neurophysiological differences were evaluated using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA).ResultsTrail Making Test scores in vEAR group were 17.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.70\u202fs and 26.28\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.83\u202fs for versions A and B, respectively, and 20.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.88\u202fs and 46.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.971\u202fs, respectively, in non-vEAR group.

    "title": "Autonomic neurotransmission in cardiovascular regulation and pathophysiology",
    "content": "The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a central regulator of cardiovascular function, coordinating involuntary control of heart rate, vascular tone, and blood pressure through its sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) subdivisions. The SNS mediates the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response via catecholamines, increasing heart rate, contractility, and vasoconstriction, whereas the PNS promotes restorative processes through acetylcholine, decreasing heart rate and enhancing vasodilation. Nitric oxide further modulates vascular tone and autonomic balance, serving as a key neuromodulator. Assessment of cardiovascular autonomic function relies on heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and other physiological tests, which provide insight into the dynamic interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Dysregulation of the ANS contributes to cardiovascular pathologies, including cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, hypertension, and heart failure, where sympathetic overactivity and impaired parasympathetic modulation exacerbate disease progression. Pharmacologic interventions, such as \u03b2-blockers and ivabradine, alongside non-pharmacologic approaches, including structured exercise and respiratory training, aim to restore autonomic balance and improve clinical outcomes. Understanding the exact mechanisms of autonomic neurotransmission is essential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and optimizing cardiovascular care. Future research integrating molecular, genetic, and systems-level analyses will further elucidate autonomic regulation, guiding personalized interventions to mitigate cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "title": "\"What I Sign Is Not What I See\": Towards Explainable and Trustworthy Cryptocurrency Wallet Signatures",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.16751v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Cryptocurrency wallets have become the primary gateway to decentralized applications, yet users often face significant difficulty in discerning what a wallet signature actually does or entails. Prior work has mainly focused on mitigating protocol vulnerabilities, with limited attention to how users perceive and interpret what they are authorizing. To examine this usability-security gap, we conducted two formative studies investigating how users interpret authentic signing requests and what cues they rely on to assess risk. Findings reveal that users often misread critical parameters, underestimate high-risk signatures, and rely on superficial familiarity rather than understanding transaction intent. Building on these insights, we designed the Signature Semantic Decoder -- a prototype framework that reconstructs and visualizes the intent behind wallet signatures prior to confirmation. Through structured parsing and semantic labeling, it demonstrates how signing data can be transformed into plain-language explanations with contextual risk cues. In a between-subjects user study (N = 128), participants using the prototype achieved higher accuracy in identifying risky signatures, improved clarity and decision confidence, and lower cognitive workload compared with the baseline wallet interface. Our study reframes wallet signing as a problem of interpretability within secure interaction design and offers design implications for more transparent and trustworthy cryptocurrency wallet interfaces.",

    "title": "Evaluating Generative AI in the Lab: Methodological Challenges and Guidelines",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.16740v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI (GenAI) systems are inherently non-deterministic, producing varied outputs even for identical inputs. While this variability is central to their appeal, it challenges established HCI evaluation practices that typically assume consistent and predictable system behavior. Designing controlled lab studies under such conditions therefore remains a key methodological challenge. We present a reflective multi-case analysis of four lab-based user studies with GenAI-integrated prototypes, spanning conversational in-car assistant systems and image generation tools for design workflows. Through cross-case reflection and thematic analysis across all study phases, we identify five methodological challenges and propose eighteen practice-oriented recommendations, organized into five guidelines. These challenges represent methodological constructs that are either amplified, redefined, or newly introduced by GenAI's stochastic nature: (C1) reliance on familiar interaction patterns, (C2) fidelity-control trade-offs, (C3) feedback and trust, (C4) gaps in usability evaluation, and (C5) interpretive ambiguity between interface and system issues. Our guidelines address these challenges through strategies such as reframing onboarding to help participants manage unpredictability, extending evaluation with constructs such as trust and intent alignment, and logging system events, including hallucinations and latency, to support transparent analysis. This work contributes (1) a methodological reflection on how GenAI's stochastic nature unsettles lab-based HCI evaluation and (2) eighteen recommendations that help researchers design more transparent, robust, and comparable studies of GenAI systems in controlled settings.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.16720v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People increasingly turn to conversational agents such as ChatGPT to seek guidance for their personal problems. As these systems grow in capability, many now display elements of \"thinking\": short reflective statements that reveal a model's intentions or values before responding. While initially introduced to promote transparency, such visible thinking can also anthropomorphise the agent and shape user expectations. Yet little is known about how these displays affect user perceptions in help-seeking contexts. We conducted a 3 x 2 mixed design experiment examining the impact of 'Thinking Content' (None, Emotionally-Supportive, Expertise-Supportive) and 'Conversation Context' (Habit-related vs. Feelings-related problems) on users' perceptions of empathy, warmth, competence, and engagement. Participants interacted with a chatbot that either showed no visible thinking or presented value-oriented reflections prior to its response. Our findings contribute to understanding how thinking transparency influences user experience in supportive dialogues, and offer implications for designing conversational agents that communicate intentions in sensitive, help-seeking scenarios.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.16708v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We explore the potential of visualization to support musicians in instrument practice through real-time feedback and reflection on their playing. Musicians often struggle to observe the patterns in their playing and interpret them with respect to their goals. Our premise is that these patterns can be made visible with interactive visualization: we can make the unhearable visible. However, understanding the design of such visualizations is challenging: the diversity of needs, including different instruments, skills, musical attributes, and genres, means that any single use case is unlikely to illustrate the broad potential and opportunities. To address this challenge, we conducted a design exploration study where we created and iterated on 33 designs, each focusing on a subset of needs, for example, only one musical skill. Our designs are grounded in our own experience as musicians and the ideas and feedback of 18 musicians with various musical backgrounds and we evaluated them with 13 music learners and teachers. This paper presents the results of our exploration, focusing on a few example designs as instances of possible instrument practice visualizations. From our work, we draw design considerations that contribute to future research and products for visual instrument education.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.16658v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mobile phones, as simultaneously personal and shared technologies, complicate how partners manage digital privacy in intimate relationships. While prior research has examined device-access practices, explicit privacy-rule negotiation, and toxic practices such as surveillance, little is known about how couples manage digital privacy without direct discussion in everyday relationships. To address this gap, we ask: How is digital privacy managed nonverbally and across different media on mobile phones? Drawing on 20 semi-structured interviews, we find that partners often regulate privacy practices through privacy silence -- the intentional avoidance of privacy-related conversations. We identify five motivations for leaving boundaries unspoken: perceiving privacy as unnecessary in intimacy, assuming implicit respect for boundaries, signaling trust and closeness, avoiding potential conflict or harm, and responding to broader societal and cultural expectations that discourage explicit privacy talk. We also identify a hierarchical grouping of content-specific privacy sensitivities, ranging from highly private domains such as financial data to lower-risk domains such as streaming accounts, and show how these priorities shift across relationship stages. These findings show how silence, culture, and content sensitivity shape everyday boundary-setting and underscore the relational and emotional dynamics underpinning mobile phone privacy management.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.16656v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People are increasingly turning to generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) for emotional support and companionship. While trust is likely to play a central role in enabling these informal and unsupervised interactions, we still lack an understanding of how people develop and experience it in this context. Seeking to fill this gap, we recruited 24 frequent users of generative AI for emotional support and conducted a qualitative study consisting of diary entries about interactions, transcripts of chats with AI, and in-depth interviews. Our results suggest important novel drivers of trust in this context: familiarity emerging from personalisation, nuanced mental models of generative AI, and awareness of people's control over conversations. Notably, generative AI's homogeneous use of personalised, positive, and persuasive language appears to promote some of these trust-building factors. However, this also seems to discourage other trust-related behaviours, such as remembering that generative AI is a machine trained to converse in human language. We present implications for future research that are likely to become critical as the use of generative AI for emotional support increasingly overlaps with therapeutic work.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.16583v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conversational agents are increasingly used in education for learning support. An application is \"learning by explaining\", where learners explain their understanding to an agent. However, existing research focuses on single roles, leaving it unclear how different pedagogical roles influence learners' interaction patterns, learning outcomes and experiences. We conducted a between-subjects study (N=96) comparing agents with three pedagogical roles (Tutee, Peer, Challenger) and a control condition while learning an economics concept. We found that different pedagogical roles shaped learning dynamics, including interaction patterns and experiences. Specifically, the Tutee agent elicited the most cognitive investment but led to high pressure. The Peer agent fostered high absorption and interest through collaborative dialogue. The Challenger agent promoted cognitive and metacognitive acts, enhancing critical thinking with moderate pressure. The findings highlight how agent roles shape different learning dynamics, guiding the design of educational agents tailored to specific pedagogical goals and learning phases.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.16356v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web GUI agents are increasingly automating everyday online tasks. Despite their popularity, little is known about how users' preferences and values impact agents' reasoning and behavior. In this work, we investigate how both explicit and implicit user preferences, as well as the underlying user values, influence agent decision-making and action trajectories. We built a controlled testbed of 14 common interactive web tasks, spanning shopping, travel, dining, and housing, each replicated from real websites and integrated with a low-fidelity LLM-based recommender system. We injected 12 human preferences and values as personas into four state-of-the-art agents and systematically analyzed their task behaviors. Our results show that preference and value-infused prompts consistently guided agents toward outcomes that reflected these preferences and values. While the absence of user preference or value guidance led agents to exhibit a strong efficiency bias and employ shortest-path strategies, their presence steered agents' behavior trajectories through the greater use of corresponding filters and interactive web features. Despite their influence, dominant interface cues, such as discounts and advertisements, frequently overrode these effects, shortening the agents' action trajectories and inducing rationalizations that masked rather than reflected value-consistent reasoning. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) an open-source testbed for studying the influence of values in agent behaviors, and (2) an empirical investigation of how user preferences and values shape web agent behaviors.",

While research of romance scams in Western countries finds victims to predominantly be middle-age, it is unknown if minors in geographic regions with cultural norms around teenage marriage are uniquely susceptible to online dating romance scams. We present an interview study with 16 victims of online dating romance scams in Iran who were minors when scammed. Findings show that, with westernized dating apps banned in Iran, scammers find teenage victims through messaging platforms tethered to local neighborhoods, offering relief for parental pressures around finding a marital partner and academic performance. Using threats, lies, and exploitation of emotional attachment lacking from their families, scammers pressured minors into financial and sexual favors. The study demonstrates how local cultural context should be foregrounded in future research on, and solutions for, technology-mediated harm against minors.

    "title": "Automated Place Preference Paradigm for Optogenetic Stimulation of the Pedunculopontine Nucleus Reveals Motor Arrest-Linked Preference Behavior",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.12054v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Understanding how the brain integrates motor suppression with motivational processes remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. The rostral Pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem structure involved in motor control, has been shown to induce transient motor arrest upon optogenetic or electrical stimulation. However, our current understanding of its potential role in linking motor suppression with motivational or reinforcement-related processes is still insufficient. To further explore the effects induced by PPN stimulations and infer the potential mechanism underlying its role involved in both motor and emotional regulation, we developed a fully automated, low-cost system combining real-time animal tracking with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation, using the OpenMV Cam H7 Plus and embedded neural network models. The system autonomously detects the rat's position and triggers optical stimulation upon entry into a predefined region of interest, enabling unbiased, unsupervised behavioral assays. Optogenetic activation of CaMKIIa-expressing neurons in the rostral PPN reliably induced transient motor arrest. When motor arrest was spatially paired with a defined region of interest, rats developed a robust place preference after limited training. These results suggest that rostral PPN activation can couple motor inhibition with reinforcement-related behavioral circuitry. Together, our work provides both a technical framework for scalable closed-loop neuroscience experiments and preliminary evidence that the rostral PPN may participate in coordinating motor suppression with motivational processes.",

    "title": "State Space Models Naturally Produce Time Cell and Oscillatory Behaviors and Scale to Abstract Cognitive Functions",
    "content": "arXiv:2507.13638v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal connectivity and biophysics, how these low-level phenomena eventually produce abstract behaviors remains largely unresolved. Here, we propose that a framework based on State Space Models, an emerging class of deep learning architectures, can help bridge this gap. We suggest that the differential equations governing elements in a State Space Model are conceptually consistent with the dynamics of biophysical processes, while the model offers a scalable framework to build on the dynamics to produce emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this framework by training a model employing a diagonal state transition matrix on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement learning. Our results suggest that neural behaviors such as time cells naturally emerge from two fundamental principles: optimal pre-configuration and rotational dynamics. These features are shown mathematically to optimize history compression, and naturally generate structured temporal dynamics even prior to training, mirroring recent findings in biological circuits. We show that learning acts primarily as a selection mechanism that fine-tunes these pre-configured oscillatory modes, rather than constructing temporal codes de novo. The model can be readily scaled to abstract cognitive functions such as event counting, supporting the use of State Space Models as a computationally tractable framework for understanding neural activities.",

    "content": "arXiv:2309.15566v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The problem of explaining the relationship between subjective experience and physical reality remains difficult and unresolved. In most explanations, consciousness is epiphenomenal, without causal power. The most notable exception is Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which provides a causal explanation for consciousness. However, IIT relies on an identity between subjectivity and a particular type of physical structure, namely with an information structure that has intrinsic causal power greater than the sum of its parts. Any theory that relies on a psycho-physical identity must eventually appeal to panpsychism, which undermines that theorys claim to be fundamental. IIT has recently pivoted towards a strong version of causal emergence, but macroscopic causal structures cannot be causally stronger than its microscopic parts without some new physical law or governing principle. The approach taken here is designed to uncover such a principle. The decisive argument is entirely deductive from initial premises that are phenomenologically certain. If correct, the arguments prove that conscious experience is sufficient to create additional degrees of causal freedom independently of the content of experience, and in a manner that is unpredictable and unobservable by any temporally sequential means. This provides a fundamental principle about consciousness, and a conceptual bridge between it and the physics describing what is experienced. The principle makes testable predictions about brain function, with notable differences from IIT, some of which are also empirically testable.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.16378v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.",

    "content": "Objective. Conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields is a promising method to reduce the uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) and combined EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis due to inter-individual variations of tissue conductivities. Approaches for skull conductivity estimation based on evoked potentials and fields have been proposed in several studies, but the current knowledge about their sensitivity towards uncertainties of other tissue conductivities and the effects on source analysis accuracy is insufficient. In this study, we analyze this sensitivity for EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation and to what extent skull conductivity estimation improves the EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Approach. We simulated EEG and MEG measurements of evoked brain activity and IEDs for randomly assigned tissue conductivities and performed EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation for the simulated measurements. Following, we performed EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of the simulated IEDs and compared the results with and without using the individually estimated skull conductivities. Main results. We find that EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation is more accurate than EEG skull conductivity estimation, especially when considering realistic noise levels, whereas the type of the evoked brain activity only had a minor influence on the accuracy of the conductivity estimation. Both EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation clearly improve source analysis accuracy for EEG and combined EEG/MEG source analysis, reducing the uncertainty of the source localization from a few centimeters to less than one centimeter for most sources. However, we find that the effect of the conductivity estimation is less pronounced for sources at the base of the brain. Significance. EEG and EEG/MEG conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields has the potential to become a valuable tool to reduce uncertainty in source analysis of IEDs, while it only requires little additional measurement effort.",

The code you write closely resembles standard python code with some structural conventions added to automatically unlock these abilities. There\u2019s too much to describe in just this post, so I ask that you check out the comprehensive README for a thorough description and explanation of all the features that I described above.</p> <p>Darl only has python standard library dependencies. This library was not vibe-coded, every line and feature was thoughtfully considered and built on top a decade of experience in the quantitative modeling field. Darl is MIT licensed.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>The motivating use case for this library is computational modeling, so mainly data scientists/analysts/engineers, however the abilities provided by this library are broadly applicable across many different disciplines.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>The closest libraries to darl in look feel and functionality are fn_graph (unmaintained) and Apache Hamilton (recently picked up by the apache foundation). However, darl offers several conveniences and capabilities over both, more of which are covered in the &quot;Alternatives&quot; section of the README.</p> <p><strong>Quick Demo</strong></p> <p>Here is a quick working snippet.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>,</p> <p>I wanted to share a CLI tool I built to solve a personal headache: organizing folders full of unnamed music files (like `01 Audio Track.m4a`).</p> <p>**Repository &amp; Download:** <a href=\"https://github.com/jlfernandes22/Music-Renamer-CLI\">https://github.com/jlfernandes22/Music-Renamer-CLI</a></p> <p>### What My Project Does</p> <p>Music Renamer CLI automatically identifies and renames music files in a directory. It uses `ffmpeg` to capture a snippet of the audio and sends it to Shazam (via the `shazamio` library) to fetch metadata. It then renames the file to `Artist - Title.ext`.</p> <p>It is specifically optimized for Windows users:</p> <p>* It comes compiled as a standalone `.exe` (so non-coders don't need Python installed).</p> <p>* It includes a patch for SSL certificate errors (`aiohttp` often fails on older/corporate Windows machines due to missing certs).</p> <p>* It preserves the original file extension (.mp3, .wav, .m4a, etc.).</p> <p>### Target Audience</p> <p>This tool is for **music hoarders** or anyone with a messy &quot;Downloads&quot; folder who wants a &quot;set it and forget it&quot; solution. It is meant for production use on personal collections. It is particularly useful for Windows users who struggle with Python environment setups, as I focused heavily on the PyInstaller build process to bundle dependencies correctly.</p> <p>I created this tool because I personally struggled using MusicBrainz Picard to recognize some old songs I had on a disc, and I needed something simpler that just worked based on audio fingerprinting.</p> <p>### Comparison</p> <p>* **Vs MusicBrainz Picard:** Picard is the gold standard but is a heavy GUI application that requires manual interaction and clustering. My tool is a lightweight CLI designed for quick, automated &quot;fire and forget&quot; renaming based on audio fingerprinting rather than existing metadata.</p> <p>* **Vs Standard Shazam:** Standard Shazam identifies one song at a time manually. This tool handles batch processing of entire folders.</p> <p>* **Vs AudioTag:** This runs locally (mostly) and doesn't require uploading full files to a web service, only the fingerprint is sent.</p> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback on the code structure or the Windows build approach!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SolidEstablishment70\"> /u/SolidEstablishment70 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmr22w/project_music_renamer_cli_a_standalone_tool_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmr22w/project_music_renamer_cli_a_standalone_tool_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "title": "Reconfiguration of Premotor Excitation and Inhibition Drives Behavior-Specific Protopodium Dynamics in Drosophila Larvae",
    "content": "Animals use the same muscles to generate distinct locomotor behaviors, raising the question of how shared motor systems produce behavior-specific outputs. In Drosophila larvae, forward and backward crawling recruit largely overlapping motor pools but differ in the timing of ventral oblique (VO) muscle activation, which occurs late in forward crawling and early in backward crawling. Although this timing difference has been described, the circuit mechanisms that impose it and its functional significance have remained unclear. Here, we show that VO muscles are primary drivers of protopodium movement, a limb-like structure involved in substrate engagement during crawling, and that their behavior-specific activation timing is controlled by a tri-segmental premotor circuit. Using muscle calcium imaging, optogenetic and connectome-based circuit analysis, and biomechanical modeling, we identify a feedforward inhibitory motif composed of two previously characterized excitatory premotor neurons (A27h and A18b3) and the inhibitory premotor neuron A06c. During forward crawling, A06c exhibits a biphasic activity pattern that defines a narrow temporal window for VO contraction and prevents premature, multi-segmental VO activation. During backward crawling, this premotor configuration is disengaged: A27h and A18b3 are inactive, and the initial inhibitory peak of A06c is absent, permitting earlier VO activation. Disrupting this circuit causes premature VO activation, impaired protopodium folding, compressed intersegmental coordination, and reduced forward crawling efficiency. Together, our findings show how reconfiguration of premotor excitation and inhibition generates behavior-specific muscle dynamics within a shared motor system.",

Searching around a bit, it was very hard to find a single source or interactive map of active beacons, and a description of what the \"characteristic\" meant. The Coast Guard maintains a list of active lights though, that they publish annually (<a href=\"https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/light-list-annual-publication\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/light-list-annual-publication</a>). With some help from Claude Code, it wasn't hard to extract the lat/long and put together a small webapp that shows a map of these light stations and illustrates their characteristic with an animated visualization..<p>Of course, this shouldn't be used as a navigational aid, merely for informational purposes! Though having lived in Seattle and San Francisco I thought it was quite interesting.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46756427\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46756427</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modeling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of RS neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.",

    "content": "Adaptive coding in sensory circuits enables stable perception while accommodating experience-dependent changes. In the olfactory bulb (OB), repeated odor exposure reshapes population activity even without explicit behavioral feedback, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain unclear. By analyzing longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging datasets from the mouse OB, we identified three concurrent forms of representational change: gain adaptation, similarity-dependent pattern separation or convergence, and a rotation of encoding subspace resulting in the representational drift. Using a computational model of the mitral cell-granule cell circuit, we showed that Hebbian plasticity and structural connectivity constraints are sufficient to reproduce these transformations. Despite global representational drift, the relative geometry of odor response vectors remained stable, preserving a low-dimensional odor manifold. Together, our results reveal how local plasticity and network structure jointly enable both stability and flexibility in early sensory coding.",

    "title": "A systematic review of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based task paradigms in stroke rehabilitation",
    "content": "Precision in assessing neurological function after stroke is key to optimizing the efficacy of rehabilitation. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides a highly ecologically valid assessment of cortical activation and functional reorganization after stroke by monitoring cortical hemodynamic changes during different tasks. However, the current fNIRS task paradigm lacks systematic integration for standardized design and clinical translation strategies, and fragmented evidence is difficult to converge into actionable practice guidelines. To fill this gap, this paper systematically reviews the application of fNIRS in motor, cognitive, language, and dual-task paradigms in stroke rehabilitation research. It reveals the clinical value of different paradigms for neurological function assessment and proposes adaptive task designs that fit the functional characteristics of patients with stroke. This study emphasizes the importance of personalized and ecological paradigms, providing a theoretical basis and practical reference for subsequent standardized research on fNIRS task paradigms and developing clinical application standards.",

    "title": "Differences in stimulus evoked electroencephalographic entropy reduction distinguishes cognitively normal Parkinson\u2019s disease participants from healthy aged-matched controls",
    "content": "Objective. Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease best known for its defining motor symptoms. However, it is also associated with significant cognitive impairment at all stages of the disease, with many patients eventually progressing to dementia. Therefore, there exists a significant need to identify objective functional biomarkers that better predict and monitor cognitive decline. While methods that analyse either spontaneous or evoked electroencephalogram (EEG), due to increasing practical usability and ostensible objectivity, have been investigated, current approaches are limited in that the associated measures are, in the absence of a theoretical basis, purely correlative. Approach. To address this shortcoming, we propose calculating changes in evoked EEG amplitude variability, quantified using information theoretic differential entropy (DE), during a three-level passive auditory oddball task, as it is argued this will directly index functional changes in cognition. We therefore estimate changes in stimulus-evoked DE in cognitively normal PD participants (N = 25), both on and off their medication, and in healthy age-matched controls (N = 25), and find substantial stimulus (standard, target, novel) and group differences. Main results. Notably, we find the time-course of the return of post-stimulus reductions in DE (i.e. information processing) to pre-stimulus levels delayed in PD compared to healthy controls, thus mirroring the assumed bradyphrenia. The observed changes in DE, together with the corollary increases in resting alpha (8\u201313 Hz) band activity seen in PD, are explained in the context of a well-known macroscopic theory of mammalian electrocortical activity, in terms of reduced tonic thalamo-cortical drive. Significance. This method of task-evoked DE EEG amplitude variability is expected to generalise to any situation where the objective determination of cognitive function is sought.",

    "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
    "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

    "content": "Peripheral injury reprograms metabolism in spinal cord oligodendrocytes, initiating a molecular cascade that drives chronic pain via neuronal {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) release. After injury, mouse spinal oligodendrocytes downregulate myelin protein synthesis and upregulate lipid biosynthesis- but reroute lipids toward neuroplastic remodeling and away from myelin maintenance. This metabolic reallocation disrupts myelin integrity and axonal function, causing neuronal accumulation of amyloid precursor protein, enhanced expression of its processing {beta}-secretase BACE1, and local release of A{beta} peptides. Blocking A{beta} production or clearing A{beta} deposits stops the transition to pain chronicity. Deleting the lysosomal lipid hydrolase NAAA in oligodendrocytes prevents both injury-induced A{beta} production and chronic pain development. The findings identify an unexpected mechanistic link between chronic pain and Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration, positioning A{beta} as a target for therapeutic intervention.",

    "title": "Distinct roles of directional and positional experience in de novo visuomotor learning",
    "content": "Humans can flexibly acquire entirely new sensorimotor mappings, a process known as de novo motor learning. A central challenge in de novo motor learning is that the learner must discover a viable solution from scratch within a highly redundant control space, without predefined task constraints. Understanding what types of sensorimotor information contribute to the formation of accurate motor behavior in such situations is therefore critical for explaining how novel sensorimotor skills are acquired. While previous studies have suggested that novel visuomotor mappings can be formed based on movement direction and target position, it remains unclear how these two types of information contribute to the learning process. To address this question, we trained 25 human participants to learn arbitrary joystick-to-cursor mapping. We then employed a generalization paradigm to selectively restrict learning experience to either movement direction or target position. Three distinct target conditions were designed: one emphasized target position (P), another emphasized movement direction (D), and a third (P&amp;D) encouraged learning of both components separately. As a result, direction experience improved movement initiation, whereas position experience enhanced movement termination. However, in the P&amp;D condition, combining these experiences did not yield additive generalization. Instead, endpoint accuracy was positively correlated with the degree of alignment between direction- and position-based joystick outputs within the control space. These results suggest that accurate formation of a novel sensorimotor map depends on the coordinated use of directional and positional experiences.",

    "title": "Towards robust probabilistic maps in Deep Brain Stimulation: exploring the impact of patient number, stimulation counts, and statistical approaches",
    "content": "IntroductionProbabilistic Stimulation Maps (PSMs) are increasingly employed to identify brain regions associated with optimal therapeutic outcomes in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). However, their reliability and generalizability are challenged by the limited size of most patient cohorts and the inherent variability introduced by different statistical methods and input data configurations. This study aimed to investigate the geometrical variability of Probabilistic Sweet Spots (PSS) as a function of both the number of patients (nPat) and the number of stimulations per patient (nStim), and to model a stability boundary defining the minimum data requirements for obtaining geometrically stable PSS.MethodsThree statistical approaches\u2013Bayesian t-test, Wilcoxon test with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction, and Wilcoxon test with nonparametric permutation correction\u2013were applied to two patient cohorts: a primary cohort of 36 patients undergoing DBS for Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), and a secondary cohort of 61 patients treated for Essential Tremor (ET), used to assess generalizability. Stimulation test data was collected intra-operatively for the first cohort and post-operatively for the second one. Geometric stability was evaluated based on variability in PSS volume extent and centroid location.ResultsThe analysis revealed a non-linear trade-off between nPat and nStim to yield stable PSS. A stability boundary was defined, representing the minimum combinations of nPat\u2013nStim required for anatomically robust PSS. Among the tested methods, the Bayesian t-test achieved stability with smaller sample sizes (\u223c15 patients) and demonstrated a consistent performance across both cohorts. In contrast, the Wilcoxon-based methods showed variable behavior between cohorts, which differed in symptom type and testing phase (intra-operative testing vs. post-operative screening).DiscussionThe proposed PSS stability boundary provides a practical reference for designing DBS studies and stimulation screening protocols aimed at probabilistic mapping. The Bayesian t-test emerged as a reliable method across both cohorts, supporting its potential in studies with limited sample sizes and scenarios where the method needs to be readily generalized to varying symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of considering both cohort size and stimulation count in probabilistic DBS mapping and call for further investigation into method-specific sensitivities to clinical and procedural factors.",

    "content": "Community detection is a crucial task in network research, applicable to social systems, biology, cybersecurity, and knowledge graphs. Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited significant representational capability; yet, they frequently experience instability and erroneous clustering, often referred to as \u201dhallucinations.\u201d These artifacts stem from sensitivity to high-frequency eigenmodes, over-parameterization, and noise amplification, undermining the robustness of learned communities. To mitigate these constraints, we present F2-CommNet, a Fourier\u2013Fractional neural framework that incorporates fractional-order dynamics, spectrum filtering, and Lyapunov-based stability analysis. The fractional operator implements long-memory dampening that mitigates oscillations, whereas Fourier spectral projections selectively attenuate eigenmodes susceptible to hallucination. Theoretical analysis delineates certain stability criteria under Lipschitz non-linearities and constrained disturbances, resulting in a demonstrable expansion of the Lyapunov margin. Experimental validation on synthetic and actual networks indicates that F2-CommNet reliably diminishes hallucination indices, enhances stability margins, and produces interpretable communities in comparison to integer-order GNN baselines. This study integrates fractional calculus, spectral graph theory, and neural network dynamics, providing a systematic method for hallucination-resistant community discovery.",

As a common complication of cancer, CRCI significantly affects patients\u2019 quality of life. In recent years, the neurobiological mechanisms of CRCI have garnered widespread attention. Research indicates that cancer-related therapies lead to CRCI by affecting brain structure, function, metabolism, and blood perfusion. Various neuroimaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and electroencephalography (EEG), have been extensively employed to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of CRCI.

    "content": "Prosthetic knee joints are essential assistive technologies designed to replicate natural gait and improve mobility for individuals with lower-limb loss. This study presents a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of a two-degree-of-freedom prosthetic knee joint and introduces three robust nonlinear control strategies: Integral Sliding Mode Control, Conditional Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control, and Conditional Adaptive Positive Semidefinite Barrier Function-based Sliding Mode Control. These controllers are designed to address the challenges associated with nonlinear joint dynamics, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties during locomotion. To optimize control performance, the gain parameters of each controller were fine-tuned using Red Fox Optimization, a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the intelligent hunting behavior of red foxes. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov theory, and control effectiveness is evaluated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and validated via hardware-in-the-loop testing using a C2000 Delfino F28379D microcontroller. Among the three controllers, the CoBA-based approach demonstrated the highest tracking accuracy, fastest convergence, and smoothest torque profile. The close agreement between simulation and experimental results confirms the practical applicability of the proposed control framework, offering a promising solution for intelligent and adaptive prosthetic knee systems.",

    "content": "IntroductionExposure to violence has been associated with alterations in how the brain organizes thought, regulates emotions, and guides behavior. In Colombia, decades of armed conflict have generated heterogeneous patterns of cognitive vulnerability, yet evidence on executive and emotional functioning in adult victims remains limited.MethodsThis cross-sectional study compared executive and emotional functioning between victims and non-victims of the Colombian armed conflict. A total of 300 middle-aged adults from the Department of Bol\u00edvar were assessed using a neuropsychological battery (MMSE, Tower of Hanoi, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test, and Frontal Assessment Battery) and emotional screening instruments (GAD-7 and PHQ-2). Executive function was modeled as a latent construct using confirmatory factor analysis and Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Random Forest was implemented as a complementary, assumption-free analytic strategy.ResultsVictims showed significantly poorer performance in planning, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control (\u03b2 = \u20130.178; p = 0.024). Educational attainment emerged as the strongest predictor of executive functioning (\u03b2 = \u20130.249; p < 0.001). The factorial model showed modest fit (CFI = 0.76), reflecting ecological and educational heterogeneity. Machine learning analyses converged with latent-variable results, identifying exposure to violence and structural inequalities as the strongest predictors of executive variability, whereas emotional factors played a marginal role.DiscussionThe findings delineate a cognitive profile associated with conflict-related victimization, characterized by vulnerabilities in executive control processes. These results underscore the need for clinical and public policy interventions that integrate neuroscientific approaches to strengthen planning and decision-making capacities in populations affected by armed conflict.",

    "content": "IntroductionAs a privileged group within the social structure, the wealthy play a significant role in social philanthropy and public welfare initiatives, making their empathic capacity a subject of considerable interest. Previous research has found that wealthy individuals who have experienced upward class mobility paradoxically demonstrate reduced empathy toward the poor. However, these studies were predominantly conducted in individualistic cultural contexts, leaving the collectivist cultural perspective largely unexplored.MethodsThe present study employed a virtual-society paradigm to experimentally simulate class mobility in a collectivist context. Objective mobility direction (upward vs. horizontal) and subjective evaluation of mobility (positive vs. negative) were manipulated to construct four types of wealthy roles (upward-positive, upward-negative, horizontal-positive, horizontal-negative). Chinese university students from a collectivist cultural background were instructed to sequentially adopt each wealthy role and judge painful versus neutral pictures of the same low-status target, while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded.ResultsThe results revealed that in the early N2 component, under upward mobility conditions, pain stimuli elicited significantly smaller N2 amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli, while no significant difference was observed under horizontal mobility conditions. In positive evaluation conditions, pain stimuli evoked significantly smaller N2 amplitudes than neutral stimuli, whereas no significant difference emerged in negative evaluation conditions. For the late LPP component, pain stimuli consistently elicited significantly larger LPP amplitudes than neutral stimuli, regardless of either the objective direction of class mobility or subjective evaluation.DiscussionThese findings suggest that, within this simulated class-mobility context, upward mobility experiences and positive appraisal primarily influence early neural processing of the poor target\u2019s pain, while later evaluative processing remains relatively stable. This study provides neural-level evidence for understanding how class mobility affects pain empathy among the wealthy in collectivist cultures, thereby enriching research on the relationship between social stratification and pain empathy.",

    "content": "Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) is a rare autosomal dominant leukodystrophy primarily caused by mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene, characterized by progressive cognitive and motor decline. We present a case of a 42-year-old Chinese woman with a rapidly progressive syndrome featuring prominent apathy, cognitive impairment, and hypoactivity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive confluent white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas grade 3) predominantly in frontal and parietal lobes, cerebral atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum. Comprehensive genetic testing identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the CSF1R gene (c.2342C\u202f>\u202fT, p.Ala781Val), located within the tyrosine kinase domain, confirming the Diagnosis of HDLS. This case highlights early apathy and hypoactivity as red-flag manifestations of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy in a 42-year-old woman with rapidly progressive cognitive decline. The atypical presentation, initially mimicking psychiatric or demyelinating disease, underscores the need to consider CSF1R sequencing when encountering early-onset cognitive or behavioral deterioration with unexplained white-matter changes, thereby facilitating timely diagnosis and genetic counseling.",

    "content": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common neurological disorder that diminishes neuromotor control. Exercise training provides a nonpharmacological treatment option that may help motor symptom severity and trajectory. In the present case series, we assessed linear and non-linear measures of neuromotor control along with functional measures of mobility in six men living with PD across a year of multimodal exercise training. Our measurements encompassed mobility, balance, strength, and force control metrics and were captured at baseline as well as at defined intervals following exercise engagement. The results appear to indicate a favorable preservation of functional ability and neuromotor control for most of the cohort across the yearlong exercise intervention. Our linear measures of neuromotor control generally remained stable with slight improvements from baseline to month 12, with visually distinct trends for our non-linear measures (Sample Entropy) of neuromotor control suggestive of more adaptive motor control strategies for both postural and force control. These data corroborate reports showing favorable outcomes for people with Parkinson's Disease following exercise engagement. Our year-long assessment of neuromotor control in a cohort of men with Parkinson's disease provides a novel contribution to the trajectory of change in this population while undergoing multimodal exercise training.",

    "content": "<p>To power the firewalling for our agents so that they couldn't contact arbitrary services, I build netfence. It's like Envoy but for eBPF filters.<p>It allows you to define different DNS-based rules that are resolved in a local daemon to IPs, then pushed to the eBPF filter to allow traffic. By doing it this way, we can still allow DNS-defined rules, but prevent contacting random IPs.<p>There's also no network performance penalty, since it's just DNS lookups and eBPF filters referencing memory.<p>It also means you don't have to tamper with the base image, which the agent could potentially manipulate to remove rules (unless you prevent root maybe).<p>It automatically manages the lifecycle of eBPF filters on cgroups and interfaces, so it works well for both containers and micro VMs (like Firecracker).<p>You implement a control plane, just like Envoy xDS, which you can manage the rules of each cgroup/interface. You can even manage DNS through the control plane to dynamically resolve records (which is helpful as a normal DNS server doesn't know which interface/cgroup a request might be coming from).<p>We specifically use this to allow our agents to only contact S3, pip, apt, and npm.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46754724\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46754724</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

I work with large dfs often 20m+ and have lot of ram. 256gb+. </p> <p>Also, on another note I have never used polars. Is it good and just better than pandas even with pandas 3.0. and can handle most of what pandas does? So maybe instead of going from pandas 1 to pandas 3 I can just jump straight to polars? </p> <p>I read somewhere it has worse gis support. I do work with geopandas often. Not sure if it's gonna be a problem. Let me know what you guys think. thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Consistent_Tutor_597\"> /u/Consistent_Tutor_597 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmfydr/pandas_30_vs_pandas_10_whats_the_difference/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmfydr/pandas_30_vs_pandas_10_whats_the_difference/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Integration of ethologically defined anxiety-related behaviors in the ventral hippocampus",
    "content": "Anxiety is a complex emotional state that unfolds as structured sequences of risk assessment and exploratory behaviors enabling animals to evaluate potential threats in the environment. The ventral hippocampus (vH) regulates anxiety responses, yet the neuronal substrates orchestrating specific ethologically defined anxiety-related behaviors remain unclear. Here, we combined high-resolution 3D behavioral tracking with cell-type specific in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulations to dissect vH microcircuit dynamics during anxiety. We identified protected and unprotected stretch-attend postures (pSAP and uSAP), along with head dipping, as core anxiety-related risk-assessment behaviors organized along a spatial gradient in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Ventral hippocampal (vH) pyramidal neurons were broadly engaged across all risk-assessment behaviors, consistent with a generalized role in encoding anxiety-related information. In contrast, interneuronal subclasses exhibited striking functional specialization: parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were selectively recruited during uSAP and head dipping, behaviors associated with direct threat exposure, whereas somatostatin (Sst) interneurons were preferentially activated during pSAP, which reflect approach-avoidance conflicts and decision-making processes. Collectively, these findings establish a microcircuit-level framework in which distinct vH neuronal subclasses differentially gate risk-assessment strategies, enabling flexible transitions between avoidance and exploratory behaviors during anxiety.",

    "title": "Tractometry-Based Quantification of Along-Tract White-Matter Hemispheric Asymmetry in Alzheimer's Disease",
    "content": "White-matter hemispheric asymmetry is a fundamental property of human brain organization and is known to change in aging, neurodevelopment, and neurodegenerative disorders. Tractometry analyzes diffusion-derived microstructural measures along the full length of tracts, localizing changes to specific tract-segments rather than collapsing tracts into a single value. Yet, existing frameworks lack a principled way to quantify left-right hemispheric asymmetries along homologous tracts. Here, we introduce an asymmetry-aware tractometry framework that integrates a symmetric white-matter atlas with BUAN (Bundle Analytics) to enable anatomically consistent, along-tract comparison of homologous pathways. By defining homologous bundles with a shared template and consistent orientation, each left-hemisphere segment is directly matched to its right-hemisphere counterpart, enabling principled, segment-wise comparison and revealing spatially localized asymmetries along-tract. Applying this framework to diffusion MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) comprising 1,215 subjects, we demonstrate how this approach reveals systematic left-right asymmetries across major white-matter pathways and show how these patterns differentiate cognitively normal (CN) individuals from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. This method provides a sensitive and anatomically grounded tool for studying hemispheric specialization and its disruption in aging and disease, and establishes a general approach for asymmetry-aware tractometry in population neuroimaging studies.",

    "content": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) responds to both natural and artificial rewards and to aversive stimuli; however, it remains unclear whether these opposing valence signals engage distinct neuronal ensembles. Here we used Fos-CreERT2-based activity-dependent tagging to label NAc neuronal ensembles activated by cocaine or foot shock. We found that cocaine ensemble consisted predominantly of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs), whereas foot shock ensemble similarly recruited D1- and D2-MSNs. One-photon calcium imaging in freely moving mice revealed that acute cocaine primarily excited D1-MSNs while inhibiting the majority of D2-MSNs, whereas foot shock induced excitatory responses in both types of MSNs. Optogenetic reactivation of the cocaine-ensemble elicited a strong behavioural preference, whereas reactivation of the shock-ensemble produced no significant behavioural effect. Together, these findings demonstrate that cocaine recruits a functionally specific NAc ensemble distinct from that recruited by shock, providing mechanistic insight into the valence-specific neuronal substrates underlying reward and aversion processing.",

    "title": "Spatially resolved transcriptome-metabolome integration reveals region-specific glial lipid dysregulation associated with Alzheimer's pathology",
    "content": "Glial cells maintain the brain's lipid and energy balance, and their breakdown is increasingly recognized as a causal contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). While this concept is established, no approach has directly shown how glial homeostatic failure manifests across brain regions and microenvironments or how it links local pathology, such as plaques, to global metabolic imbalance. To address this gap, we developed iMIST, an integrated platform that combines MALDI-based metabolite imaging, histology, and spatial transcriptomics within a single tissue section to align molecular and anatomical information. Using a mouse model of late-onset AD that recapitulates both amyloid deposition and metabolic vulnerability, iMIST revealed that glial lipid dysregulation is widespread but spatially specialized. In gray matter, plaque-associated microglia were associated with upregulated glycerophospholipid-remodeling in cortico-thalamic areas indicating metabolic stress around local pathology. In contrast, white matter tracts rich in lipid-producing oligodendrocytes show plaque-independent deficits in galactosylceramide metabolism reflecting their high myelin demand. Both processes intensify with age, transforming adaptive glial responses into persistent metabolic dysfunction. Together, these findings demonstrate the spatial interplay between global glial metabolic imbalance and local microenvironmental stressors associated with AD pathology. By integrating transcriptomic and metabolomic information in situ, iMIST provides a framework for uncovering how regional glial vulnerability shapes the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "title": "The compositional nature of the human alpha rhythm",
    "content": "Resting-state brain activity is dominated by oscillations in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). The dominant frequency within this band, the individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF), has been widely used as a global marker of inter-individual variability in perceptual and cognitive functions, as well as clinical phenotypes. However, the traditional approach implicitly assumes a single oscillatory rhythm varying along a parametric continuum. Here, we analyzed resting-state EEG data from more than 2000 participants across multiple independent datasets. We identify three distinct and highly stable alpha components, or archetypes, that jointly and compositionally determine the IAPF. These components exhibit dissociable age-related trajectories as well as distinct scalp topographies and cortical sources. Together, these findings indicate that individual differences in alpha activity do not reflect variation along a single frequency dimension, but rather differences in the relative contribution of discrete alpha generators. This calls for a reevaluation of many reported associations between alpha frequency, brain function, and clinical phenotypes.",

    "title": "Ketone bodies mitigate against systemic inflammation-induced changes in brain energy metabolism and delirium-like deficits in aged mice",
    "content": "Acute systemic inflammation affects brain function, with detrimental consequences in aged individuals. These include delirium, an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by fluctuating disturbances in attention, perception and cognition. Delirium is associated with disrupted brain energy metabolism but our understanding of this during acute systemic inflammation is limited. Here we hypothesized that LPS-induced systemic inflammation would disrupt brain energy metabolism in aged C57BL6J mice and that the consequent functional impairments would be mitigated by ketone body utilization. We investigated ketone body effects in sickness behaviour, inflammation, energy metabolism and cognitive function. Real-time changes in utilisation of energy sources were quantified by indirect calorimetry and administration of radioisotope-labelled glucose and betahydroxybutyrate. Mass-spectrometry metabolomics was used to index severity of behavioural distrurbances to changes in hippocampal energy metabolism. LPS precipitated hypoglycemia and induced a whole-body switch from carbohydrate to lipid utilisation. Despite this, hippocampal insulin resistance and preserved brain glucose was observed while alternative carbohydrates, mannose and fructose, became depleted. Ketone ester treatment reversed insulin resistance, mitigated sickness behaviour and prevented delirium-like cognitive dysfunction without altering pro-inflammatory responses. Our results show that promoting ketone body usage mitigates systemic inflammation-induced brain energy disruption and prevents delirium-like cognitive deficits in aged mice.",

    "title": "\u0394\u2079-Tetrahydrocannabinol-induced enhancement of reward responsivity via mesocorticolimbic modulation in squirrel monkeys",
    "content": "Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products are widely used recreationally, partly due to THC's ability to enhance the appetitive (i.e., rewarding) properties of diverse stimuli. However, the neural mechanisms through which THC modulates reward-related processing remain poorly understood. Here, we used a Pavlovian paradigm in adult squirrel monkeys (3males, 1female) to associate a visual conditioned stimulus (CS+) with appetitive food delivery. The modulatory effects of acute THC (1-10g/kg, i.m.) on behavioral and brain responses to CS+ were evaluated. Event-related functional MRI (fMRI) was employed to characterize the neural correlates of conditioned responding to the CS+, both in the absence and presence of THC treatment, with pre-conditioning scans serving as control. Behaviorally, THC (3g/kg) selectively enhanced conditioned responding to the CS+ without altering responses to the control stimulus (CS-) or increasing baseline consummatory responding, underscoring the specificity of THC's action on reward-associated processes. Consistently, fMRI analyses revealed that THC amplified CS+-evoked activation within mesocorticolimbic regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), striatum, hippocampus, and substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area (SN-VTA), without affecting activity in visual and motor cortices. This finding underscores the selectivity of THC's neuromodulatory effects on reward-related circuitry. Independent of CS exposure, resting-state functional connectivity analyses indicate that THC enhanced mesocorticolimbic network integration, as evident in strengthened SN-VTA-centered connectivity with the ACC, striatum, and hippocampus. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that THC enhances the responses to appetitive stimuli, through selective modulation of mesocorticolimbic circuitry, highlighting the SN-VTA as a pivotal hub for cannabinoid-mediated regulation of incentive salience and motivational drive toward reward-associated stimuli.",

    "title": "PRO-FitS: a novel phenotypic assay to identify enhancers of proteostasis in C. elegans",
    "content": "The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) continues to rise with the aging of populations worldwide, representing a pressing need for the establishment of therapeutic strategies. Maintaining proteostasis is crucial for healthy aging, as the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins is a key contributor to age-related cellular dysfunction and disease. This study introduces a novel phenotypic assay using Caenorhabditis elegans to screen for small molecule enhancers of proteostasis, aiming at mitigating the proteotoxic stress associated with NDs. This new methodology- PRO-FitS- uses C. elegans motor activity as a proxy for the PROteome Fitness State upon a noxious protein-denaturating stimulus, while allowing a fast and experimenter-free readout. We demonstrate the efficacy of the assay by validating the role of pharmacological mTOR inhibition and serotonergic signaling activation in reducing heat shock-induced proteotoxic damage at the whole-organism level. PRO-FitS will allow the identification of novel compounds that alleviate protein aggregation disorders, potentially revealing new pathways and cellular targets not previously implicated in proteotoxicity.",

    "title": "Exogenously driven neural reactivation of spatially matching visual working-memory contents",
    "content": "Selective attention is often divided into voluntary (goal-directed) and involuntary (stimulus-driven) forms, a distinction extensively studied for attention to external sensory input. In contrast, internal selective attention--directed toward representations held in working memory (WM)--has been considered primarily for voluntary influences. Recent behavioral evidence suggests that task-irrelevant external stimuli can also influence internal selection of feature-matching WM representations involuntarily, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we tested whether an uninformative exogenous spatial retro-cue presented during a WM delay can act as a selective ''ping'' and reactivate spatially matching WM content at the level of its representational category. Male and female human participants memorized complex contents presented at distinct locations, followed by unpredictive and task-irrelevant spatial retro-cues that conveyed no category information. Using temporally resolved multivariate EEG decoding, we observed category-specific reactivation of spatially matching WM representations following these cues, providing direct neural evidence for stimulus-driven, involuntary attentional selection within WM, ahead of the memory test. Moreover, neural responses to the subsequent memory-probe were also modulated by cue congruency, consistent with the notion that exogenous influences begin early during sensory processing while also shaping later decision-related processes. Finally, drift-diffusion model analyses revealed that this involuntary cueing effect was primarily driven by increased evidence accumulation. Together, these findings illuminate the mechanisms by which external events can automatically and involuntarily penetrate the internal cognitive workspace.",

    "content": "Understanding how brain state and sensory input shape inter-laminar communication is essential for interpreting cortical population dynamics. Using laminar recordings in macaque V1, we apply reduced-rank regression to quantify low-dimensional predictive subspaces linking Input and Superficial layers. We find that both visual stimulation and internal state (eyes open vs. closed) modulate the structure and efficacy of these subspaces, but through distinct mechanisms. Visual input induces a directional, feedforward pattern from input to superficial layers, while wakefulness-related modulation enhances coordination more symmetrically. Delay analysis and network simulations confirm that structured, layer-specific inputs produce directional prediction, whereas global fluctuations yield undirected co-activation. Importantly, differential structure across layers predicts the emergence of communication asymmetry. These findings dissociate communication from shared modulation, providing a principled framework for interpreting inter-population correlations. Our results generalize to broader cortical circuits, offering insights into when population coupling reflects genuine information flow versus global state dynamics.",

    "title": "Hippocampal tangential insertions of high-density silicone probes in head-fixed mice enhance spatial sampling",
    "content": "The hippocampus is a key structure within the medial temporal lobe which plays a central role in the formation and consolidation of declarative memories. Despite technological progress, a full understanding of hippocampal rhythms, neuronal population activity, and the underlying connectivity remain elusive, partly due to its complex morphology in a croissant-like shape which limits coronal and sagittal approaches. To address this limitation, we propose two different tangential insertions of high-density electrode probes aligned to either the dorsal or ventral sections of the hippocampus. Each approach enables the placement of up to 384 recording sites within the hippocampal formation. Both insertions are performed in head-fixed condition, which further allows for detailed monitoring of the animals behavioral states, including spontaneous running and facial movements. The two proposed tangential dorsal and ventral insertions capture almost continuously the physiology of the hippocampus across 3.84 mm of tissue. When placed across the pyramidal layer, such insertions can harness ripple oscillations over 120 channels, corresponding to approximately ~1.2 mm of tissue, with a coverage of 2 channels every 20 micrometer. Furthermore, such insertions enabled us to record up to 400 hippocampal neurons simultaneously from a single probe, endowing us with the capability to capture within a single recording several hundreds of functionally connected neuronal pairs. Lastly, these insertions were performed in head-fixed mice on a running band, which can be combined with high frequency sampling camera, allowing us to precisely monitor facial movements, and their hippocampal correlates. An orthogonal/vertical approach is a more standard way to record electrophysiological activity from most brain regions, including the hippocampus. Vertical insertions thereby miss the antero-posterior axis of the brain in the hippocampus and therefore putative propagating events. Furthermore, vertical insertions have a lower reach in terms of number of channels, single units, and spatial density being recorded, even with multi-shank high-density probes. Tangential insertions therefore substantially increase spatial reach and resolution, which leads to a higher number of cells recorded in a single insertion along the antero-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, compared to freely moving approaches, head-fixed conditions enable precise monitoring of facial movements. Dorsal and ventral head-fixed tangential insertions of Neuropixels probes in the hippocampus increase the resolution and spatial extent of recordings, allowing more precise and extensive monitoring of network activity and its underlying connectivity.",

    "title": "Virtual prototyping of non-invasive spinal cord electrical stimulation targeting upper limb motor function",
    "content": "Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) applied over the cervical or lumbar spinal cord facilitates motor function after paralysis. However, emerging electrophysiological evidence indicates mechanistic differences between cervical and lumbar tSCS and across different cervical tSCS paradigms. To clarify these discrepancies, we developed and validated a multi-scale, whole-body computational model of tSCS-induced volume conduction, axonal recruitment, and synaptic transmission. Across 24 cervical and four lumbar tSCS paradigms, simulations showed that somatosensory afferents consistently exhibit lower stimulation thresholds than motor efferents. In turn, region-specific synaptic transmission differences may explain electrophysiological discrepancies between cervical and lumbar tSCS. Across cervical tSCS paradigms, substantial volume conduction and axonal recruitment differences were observed that explain electrophysiological discrepancies. Specifically, clinically-prevalent paradigms, including those with anodes placed over the clavicles or iliac crests, engaged peripheral nerves in addition to spinal roots. This effect was amplified by multiphasic waveforms, which introduced recruitment sites near the anodes. By integrating simulations with electrophysiological recordings in 14 able-bodied individuals, we investigated previously unexplored cervical tSCS paradigms on their capacity to recruit somatosensory afferents relative to motor threshold.",

    "title": "When the brightest is not the best: illuminant estimation from the geometry of specular highlights",
    "content": "Color constancy allows us to perceive stable object colors under different lighting conditions by reducing the impact of lighting. Information about illuminant color could be derived from a white surface or a specular highlight. The 'brightest is white' heuristic has been frequently incorporated in illumination estimation models, to identify illuminant color. Here, we tested an alternative hypothesis: we use structured changes in the proximal image to identify highlight regions, even when they are not the brightest elements in the scene. In computer-rendered scenes, we varied the reliability of 'brightest element' and 'highlight geometry' cues, testing their effect on a color constancy task. Each scene had a single spherical surface lit by several point lights with identical spectral properties. The surface had a uniform spectral reflectance but a noise texture that attenuated the reflectance by a variable scale factor. We tested three levels of specularity: zero (matte), low, and mid. Observers watched a 1.5-second animation and responded if color changes were due to illuminant or material changes. Discrimination performance for matte surfaces was nearly at chance level, as predicted. However, as specularity increased, performance improved significantly. Observers outperformed an ideal observer model who relied solely on the brightest element. Notably, when the specular region appeared on a dark part of the texture, observer performance improved even more even though the brightest element heuristic would predict a decrease. When specular geometries were difficult to identify due to phase scrambling, observer performance significantly dropped. These results suggest that we do not simply rely on the brightest element, but rather utilize regularities of diffuse and specular components of the proximal image to solve surface and illuminant ambiguities.",

    "title": "Uncovering Dynamic Neural Information Flow with Continuous-Time Weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks",
    "content": "Understanding how information dynamically flows within neural systems is a crucial problem in neuroscience. Traditional approaches often assume stationary or quasi-stationary functional networks, which fail to capture the time-varying dynamics of interactions among neural variables. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous-Time weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks (CTwDBN), a non-stationary graphical modeling framework for uncovering smoothly time-varying conditional dependencies. Validation on synthetic datasets demonstrated that CTwDBN reliably recovers the structure and dynamics of ground-truth information flow. Application to electrophysiological recordings during a guided saccade task revealed temporal fluctuations in conditional dependencies in the cortical network that persisted an order of magnitude longer than the receptive field dynamics. In the resting-state cortex, CTwDBN revealed persistent fluctuations within a low-dimensional dependency space reflecting canonical anatomical motifs. These results highlight CTwDBN as a versatile analytical framework for capturing dynamic information flow in neural systems with broad applicability to complex biological and artificial systems.",

The method will allow pre-intervention tissue collection, making it possible to separate preexisting molecular differences from experience- or treatment-induced changes. We show that microbiopsies yield sufficient, high-quality RNA and chromatin for sequencing, with minimal tissue damage that largely resolves over time. The procedure uses standard stereotactic equipment and achieves reproducible spatial precision when the syringe is stabilised. This approach provides a practical framework for within-subject molecular comparisons, reducing animal use and enabling longitudinal profiling of the living mouse brain. It establishes a foundation for investigating how baseline molecular states influence later physiological or behavioural outcomes.",

    "title": "The \tC. elegans nervous system reads the internal state of the hydrogen peroxide-detoxification machinery to trigger escape from this common reactive chemical",
    "content": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the most common reactive chemical threat faced by organisms. Here, we map the neural circuit that drives chemotactic escape from environmental H2O2 in the nematode C. elegans. Twenty-four neuron classes with sensory endings at the mouth and nose of the animal detect H2O2. Their response dynamics encode stimulus intensity and exposure history, and their partial redundancy makes avoidance resilient to the loss of individual inputs. Sensing begins when H2O2 oxidizes the peroxidatic and resolving cysteines of the cytosolic peroxiredoxin PRDX-2, which relays this oxidative signal to cysteines on the LITE-1 and GUR-3 ion channels, triggering calcium influx in sensory neurons that drive escape. Most of these neurons release glutamate to drive H2O2-dependent excitation of AIA interneurons, whereas others signal through non-glutamatergic routes, providing multiple routes for signal transmission. Thus, the C. elegans nervous system acts as a hydrogen peroxide sentinel that monitors H2O2-induced changes in the intracellular H2O2-detoxification machinery and relays them to interneurons driving organism-wide escape. This raises the possibility that circuit defects in aging and neurodegenerative disease arise from altered peroxiredoxin-mediated H2O2 signaling rather than primarily from direct macromolecular damage.",

    "title": "Understanding corticosterone fluctuations and HPA-axis regulation in a mouse model of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3",
    "content": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG triplet expansion in the ATXN3 gene, primarily characterized by motor impairments. However, SCA3/MJD also includes mood-related comorbidities that affect both patients and their caregivers. Current treatments focus on symptom management and supportive care, as no disease-modifying therapies are available. Previously, we have demonstrated decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in post-mortem SCA3 human and mouse brains and elevated peripheral corticosterone (CORT) levels in SCA3 mice at late disease stages. Impaired GR signaling is typically associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, common in stress-related psychiatric diseases. Our study aimed to dissect the HPA-axis (dys)function and the effect of stress exposure on SCA3/MJD progression. Using the CMVMJD135 mouse model, we evaluated HPA-axis regulation in SCA3/MJD by measuring CORT levels throughout disease progression (6 to 34 weeks of age) under basal conditions and after acute stress. At week 35, these mice underwent a dexamethasone injection to challenge the HPA-axis, and the CORT levels were measured at different timepoints to evaluate the axis response. Additionally, we applied a 6-week chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol in another cohort of mice starting at an early symptomatic stage to assess stress effects on the progression of motor impairments. Our findings indicate that serum CORT levels in SCA3 mice begin to rise between 26 to 30 weeks of age, with no impairment in the physiological response to acute stress. SCA3 mice were also able to normalize CORT levels after dexamethasone challenge, suggesting normal HPA-axis function. While CUS exposure had a transient negative impact on the motor phenotype, this effect did not persist throughout disease progression. In conclusion, stressful events, either acute or chronic, do not seem to be major determinants of disease severity in SCA3 mice.",

    "title": "Non-viral vasculogenic reprogramming restores cognition and mitigates pathology in Alzheimer's disease",
    "content": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline associated with amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, synaptic loss, and profuse neuronal death. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that cerebrovascular impairment precedes the emergence of neuropathological hallmarks, implicating vascular dysfunction as an early contributor to AD onset and progression. We investigated a non-viral strategy to generate pro-vasculogenic fibroblasts by transiently overexpressing Etv2, Foxc2, and Fli1 (EFF) as a potential cell-based therapy for neurovascular deficits in AD. To assess therapeutic potential, EFF-primed fibroblasts were injected into a mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) and wild-type controls via the intracerebroventricular (ICV) route, followed by cognitive assessments and subsequent brain tissue analyses. Our findings demonstrate that EFF-primed fibroblasts acquire vasculogenic properties, enhance cerebral blood flow (CBF), and alleviate spatial memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice. Moreover, transplanted EFF-primed fibroblasts exhibited long-term survival, integrated into the brain vasculature, and promoted cortical vascular remodeling in the AD brain. Notably, ICV deployment of these cells is also correlated with reduced cortical A{beta} load, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits in reducing AD pathology. Transcriptomic analysis identified the activation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as Ppar, known for its anti-amyloidogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. Collectively, these findings highlight non-viral, reprogramming-based vasculogenic cell therapy as a promising strategy for AD, capable of alleviating cognitive decline and addressing AD pathology across cellular and tissue scales",

    "title": "Gamma oscillations across recording scales show a preference for saturated long-wavelength (reddish) hues in the primate visual cortex",
    "content": "Stimulus-induced narrowband gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) arise due to excitatory-inhibitory interactions and have been proposed to carry feedforward prediction errors during visual processing. However, the dependence of gamma on stimulus color is not well characterized, with some studies showing a preference for saturated long-wavelength (reddish) hues in invasive recordings from the primary visual cortex (V1), while others showing no preference for red in luminance and cone-contrast balanced colors spanning the Derrington-Krauskopf-Lennie (DKL) isoluminant plane in non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. To address these discrepancies, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from V1 (n=2 monkeys) along with scalp electroencephalography (EEG), while presenting luminance-matched hues spanning the entire permissible range of colors. We found that saturated reddish hues produced the strongest gamma in both LFP and EEG in both monkeys. However, gamma was reduced when the colors were desaturated, so that selectivity for reddish hues was diminished or absent on the DKL space, as shown previously. Interestingly, selectivity was further reduced in EEG compared to LFP. Simultaneous recordings from an intermediate visual area (V4, n=1) revealed weak color-induced gamma, partially explaining the weakening of hue selectivity in macro-signals. Gamma power increased with increasing activation along the red-green (L-M) cardinal axis but was virtually absent along the blue-yellow (S-(L+M)) axis, suggesting that gamma could be a reflection of the L-M cone-contrast mechanism. These results comprehensively resolve the earlier discrepancy and shed light about the neural mechanisms underlying gamma generation in primate V1.",

    "title": "The ApoC2 mimetic peptide D6PV enhances remyelination by stimulating oxidative phosphorylation in oligodendrocytes",
    "content": "Failure of remyelination drives neurodegeneration in demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), with disrupted lipid handling and metabolic stress in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) posing major barriers to repair. Here, we identify the dual ApoC-II mimetic- ApoC-III antagonist peptide D6PV as a metabolic modulator that directly enhances OPC differentiation and myelin repair. Across ex vivo and in vivo models of chemically induced demyelination, D6PV promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and restores myelin integrity independently of lipoprotein hydrolysis or modulation of lipid droplet-containing phagocytes. Guided by transcriptomics analyses, we find that D6PV stimulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, while suppressing inflammatory transcriptional programs, thereby driving OPCs toward a myelinating phenotype. Notably, D6PV does not alter peripheral immune composition or autoimmune-driven pathology in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, indicating a central nervous system (CNS) cell-autonomous effect. These findings reveal a metabolism-linked pathway for remyelination and position D6PV as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance CNS repair in demyelinating diseases.",

    "title": "How I went down a massive rabbit hole and ended up building 4 libraries",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A few months ago, I was in between jobs and hacking on a personal project just for fun. I built one of those automated video generators using an LLM. You know the type: the LLM writes a script, TTS narrates it, stock footage is grabbed, and it's all stitched together. Nothing revolutionary, just a fun experiment.</p> <p>I hit a wall when I wanted to add subtitles. I didn't want boring static text; I wanted styled, animated captions (like the ones you see on social media). I started researching Python libraries to do this easily, but I couldn't find anything &quot;plug-and-play.&quot; Everything seemed to require a lot of manual logic for positioning and styling.</p> <p>During my research, I stumbled upon a YouTube video called <em>&quot;Shortrocity EP6: Styling Captions Better with MoviePy&quot;</em>. At around the 44:00 mark, the creator said something that stuck with me: <em>&quot;I really wish I could do this like in CSS, that would be the best.&quot;</em></p> <p>That was the spark. I thought, <em>why not?</em> Why not render the subtitles using HTML/CSS (where styling is easy) and then burn them into the video?</p> <p>I implemented this idea using Playwright (using a headless browser) to render the HTML+CSS and then get the images. It worked, and I packaged it into a tool called <strong>pycaps</strong>. However, as I started testing it, it just felt wrong. I was spinning up an entire, heavy web browser instance just to render a few words on a transparent background. It felt incredibly wasteful and inefficient.</p> <p>I spent a good amount of time trying to optimize this setup. I implemented aggressive caching for Playwright and even wrote a custom rendering solution using OpenCV inside <code>pycaps</code> to avoid MoviePy and speed things up. It worked, but I still couldn't shake the feeling that I was using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p> <p>So, I did what any reasonable developer trying to avoid &quot;real work&quot; would do: I decided to solve these problems by building my own dedicated tools.</p> <p>First, weeks after releasing <code>pycaps</code>, I couldn't stop thinking about generating text images without the overhead of a browser. That led to <strong>pictex</strong>. Initially, it was just a library to render text using Skia (PICture + TEXt). Honestly, that first version was enough for what <code>pycaps</code> needed. But I fell into another rabbit hole. I started thinking, <em>&quot;What about having two texts with different styles? What about positioning text relative to other elements?&quot;</em> I went way beyond the original scope and integrated Taffy to support a full Flexbox-like architecture, turning it into a generic rendering engine.</p> <p>Then, to connect my original CSS templates from <code>pycaps</code> with this new engine, I wrote <strong>html2pic</strong>, which acts as a bridge, translating HTML/CSS directly into <code>pictex</code> render calls.</p> <p>Finally, I went back to my original AI video generator project. I remembered the custom OpenCV solution I had hacked together inside <code>pycaps</code> earlier. I decided to extract that logic into a standalone library called <strong>movielite</strong>. Just like with <code>pictex</code>, I couldn't help myself. I didn't simply extract the code. Instead, I ended up over-engineering it completely. I added Numba for JIT compilation and polished the API to make it a generic, high-performance video editor, far exceeding the simple needs of my original script.</p> <p><strong>Long story short:</strong> I tried to add subtitles to a video, and I ended up maintaining four different open-source libraries. The original &quot;AI Video Generator&quot; project is barely finished, and honestly, now that I have a full-time job and these four repos to maintain, it will probably never be finished. But hey, at least the subtitles render fast now.</p> <p>If anyone is interested in the tech stack that came out of this madness, or has dealt with similar performance headaches, here are the repos:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>pictex</strong> (The graphics engine): <a href=\"https://github.com/francozanardi/pictex\">https://github.com/francozanardi/pictex</a></li> <li> <strong>movielite</strong> (The video editor): <a href=\"https://github.com/francozanardi/movielite\">https://github.com/francozanardi/movielite</a></li> <li> <strong>html2pic</strong> (The HTML/CSS to image tool): <a href=\"https://github.com/francozanardi/html2pic\">https://github.com/francozanardi/html2pic</a></li> <li> <strong>pycaps</strong> (The subtitle tool that started it all): <a href=\"https://github.com/francozanardi/pycaps\">https://github.com/francozanardi/pycaps</a></li> </ul> <hr /> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>This is a suite of four interconnected libraries designed for high-performance video and image generation in Python: * <strong>pictex:</strong> Generates images programmatically using Skia and Taffy (Flexbox), allowing for complex layouts without a browser. * <strong>pycaps:</strong> Automatically generates animated subtitles for videos using Whisper for transcription and CSS for styling. * <strong>movielite:</strong> A lightweight video editing library optimized with Numba/OpenCV for fast frame-by-frame processing. * <strong>html2pic:</strong> Converts HTML/CSS to images by translating markup into <code>pictex</code> render calls.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Developers working on video automation, content creation pipelines, or anyone needing to render text/HTML to images efficiently without the overhead of Selenium or Playwright. While they started as hobby projects, they are stable enough for use in automation scripts.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>pictex/html2pic vs. Selenium/Playwright:</strong> Unlike headless browsers, this stack does not require a browser engine. It renders directly using Skia, making it significantly faster and lighter on memory for generating images.</li> <li> <strong>movielite vs. MoviePy:</strong> MoviePy is excellent and feature-rich, but <code>movielite</code> focuses on performance using Numba JIT compilation and OpenCV.</li> <li> <strong>pycaps vs. Auto-subtitle tools:</strong> Most tools offer limited styling, <code>pycaps</code> allows CSS styling while maintaining a good performance.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_unknownProtocol\"> /u/_unknownProtocol </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qm1kxu/how_i_went_down_a_massive_rabbit_hole_and_ended/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qm1kxu/how_i_went_down_a_massive_rabbit_hole_and_ended/\">[comments]</a></span>",

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>[This is my 2nd attempt at a post here; dear moderators, I am not an AI! ... at least I don't think I am ]</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ace0278/generate-openai-style-embeddings-locally-with-minilm-adapter-f43ec9c3b7da\">EmbeddingAdapters </a>is a Python library for translating between embedding model vector spaces.</p> <p>It provides plug-and-play adapters that map embeddings produced by one model into the vector space of another \u2014 locally or via provider APIs \u2014 enabling cross-model retrieval, routing, interoperability, and migration <strong>without re-embedding an existing corpus</strong>.</p> <p>If a vector index is already built using one embedding model, embedding-adapters allows it to be queried using another, without rebuilding the index.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Anyone who is a developer or startup, if you have a mobile app and you want to run ultra fast on-device RAG with provider level quality, use this. If you want to save money on embeddings over millions of queries, use this. If you want to sample embedding spaces you don't have access to - gemini mongo etc. - use this.</p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> There is no comparable library that specializes in this</p> <p><strong>Why I Made This:</strong> This solved a serious pain point for me, but I also realized that we could extend it greatly as a community. Each time a new model is added to the library, it permits a new connection\u2014you can effectively walk across different model spaces. Chain these adapters together and you can do some really interesting things.</p> <p>For example, you could go from OpenAI \u2192 MiniLM (you may not think you want to do that, but consider the cost savings of being able to interact with MiniLM embeddings as if they were OpenAI).</p> <p>I know this doesn\u2019t sound possible, but it is. The adapters reinterpret the semantic signals already present in these models. It won\u2019t work for every input text, but by pairing each adapter with a confidence score, you can effectively route between a provider and a local model. This cuts costs dramatically and significantly speeds up query embedding generation.</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/PotentiallyARobot/EmbeddingAdapters/\">https://github.com/PotentiallyARobot/EmbeddingAdapters/</a></p> <p><strong>PyPI:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/embedding-adapters/\">https://pypi.org/project/embedding-adapters/</a></p> <h1>Example</h1> <p>Generate an OpenAI embedding locally from minilm+adapter:</p> <pre><code>pip install embedding-adapters embedding-adapters embed \\ --source sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \\ --target openai/text-embedding-3-small \\ --flavor large \\ --text &quot;where are restaurants with a hamburger near me&quot; </code></pre> <p>The command returns:</p> <ul> <li>an embedding in the target (OpenAI) space</li> <li>a confidence / quality score estimating adapter reliability</li> </ul> <h1>Model Input</h1> <p>At inference time, the adapter\u2019s <strong>only input is an embedding vector</strong> from a source model.<br /> No text, tokens, prompts, or provider embeddings are used.</p> <p>A pure <strong>vector \u2192 vector</strong> mapping is sufficient to recover most of the retrieval behavior of larger proprietary embedding models for in-domain queries.</p> <h1>Benchmark results</h1> <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> SQuAD (8,000 Q/A pairs)</p> <p><strong>Latency (answer embeddings):</strong></p> <ul> <li>MiniLM embed: <strong>1.08 s</strong></li> <li>Adapter transform: <strong>0.97 s</strong></li> <li>OpenAI API embed: <strong>40.29 s</strong></li> </ul> <p>\u2248 <strong>70\u00d7 faster</strong> for local MiniLM + adapter vs OpenAI API calls.</p> <p><strong>Retrieval quality (Recall@10):</strong></p> <ul> <li>MiniLM \u2192 MiniLM: <strong>10.32%</strong></li> <li>Adapter \u2192 Adapter: <strong>15.59%</strong></li> <li>Adapter \u2192 OpenAI: <strong>16.93%</strong></li> <li>OpenAI \u2192 OpenAI: <strong>18.26%</strong></li> </ul> <p>Bootstrap difference (OpenAI \u2212 Adapter \u2192 OpenAI): <strong>~1.34%</strong></p> <p>For in-domain queries, the MiniLM \u2192 OpenAI adapter recovers ~<strong>93%</strong> of OpenAI retrieval performance and substantially outperforms MiniLM-only baselines.</p> <h1>How it works (high level)</h1> <p>Each adapter is trained on a <strong>restricted domain</strong>, allowing it to specialize in interpreting the semantic signals of smaller models and projecting them into higher-dimensional provider spaces while preserving retrieval-relevant structure.</p> <p>A quality score is provided to determine whether an input is well-covered by the adapter\u2019s training distribution.</p> <h1>Practical uses in Python applications</h1> <ul> <li>Query an existing vector index built with one embedding model using another</li> <li>Operate mixed vector indexes and route queries to the most effective embedding space</li> <li>Reduce cost and latency by embedding locally for in-domain queries</li> <li>Evaluate embedding providers before committing to a full re-embed</li> <li>Gradually migrate between embedding models</li> <li>Handle provider outages or rate limits gracefully</li> <li>Run RAG pipelines in air-gapped or restricted environments</li> <li>Maintain a stable \u201ccanonical\u201d embedding space while changing edge models</li> </ul> <h1>Supported adapters</h1> <ul> <li>MiniLM \u2194 OpenAI</li> <li>OpenAI \u2194 Gemini</li> <li>E5 \u2194 MiniLM</li> <li>E5 \u2194 OpenAI</li> <li>E5 \u2194 Gemini</li> <li>MiniLM \u2194 Gemini</li> </ul> <p>The project is under active development, with ongoing work on additional adapter pairs, domain specialization, evaluation tooling, and training efficiency.</p> <p>Please Like/Upvote</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Interesting-Town-433\"> /u/Interesting-Town-433 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlx02c/generate_openai_embeddings_locally_with_minilm/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlx02c/generate_openai_embeddings_locally_with_minilm/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "content": "The present PRISMA-guided article systematically reviews the current state of research on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

    "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "title": "CTSSP: A temporal\u2013spectral-spatial joint optimization algorithm for motor imagery EEG decoding",
    "content": "Objective. Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interfaces hold significant promise for neurorehabilitation, yet their performance is often compromised by electroencephalography (EEG) non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and severe cross-session variability. Current decoding methods typically suffer from fragmented optimization, treating temporal, spectral, and spatial features in isolation. Approach. We propose common temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns (CTSSP), a unified framework that jointly optimizes filters across all three domains. The algorithm integrates: (1) multi-scale temporal segmentation to capture dynamic neural evolution, (2) channel-adaptive finite impulse response filters to enhance task-relevant rhythms, and (3) low-rank regularization to improve generalization. Main results. Evaluated across five public datasets, CTSSP achieves state-of-the-art performance. It yielded mean accuracies of 76.9% (within-subject), 68.8% (cross-session), and 69.8% (cross-subject). In within-subject and cross-session scenarios, CTSSP significantly outperformed competing baselines by margins of 2.6%\u201314.6% (p < 0.001) and 2.3%\u201313.8% (p < 0.05), respectively. In cross-subject tasks, it achieved the highest average accuracy, proving competitive against deep learning models. Neurophysiological visualization confirms that the learned filters align closely with motor cortex activation mechanisms. Significance. CTSSP effectively overcomes the limitations of decoupled feature extraction by extracting robust, interpretable, and coupled temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns. It offers a powerful, data-efficient solution for decoding MI EEG in noisy, non-stationary environments. The code is available at https://github.com/PLC-TJU/CTSSP.",

    "title": "Automated 3D segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from micro-computed tomography images using anatomy-aware neural networks",
    "content": "Objective. Precise segmentation and quantification of nerve morphology from imaging data are critical for designing effective and selective peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapies. However, prior studies on nerve morphology segmentation suffer from important limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. This study introduces a deep learning approach for robust and automated three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) images. Methods. We developed a multi-class 3D U-Net to segment fascicles and epineurium that incorporates a novel anatomy-aware loss function to ensure that predictions respect nerve topology. We trained and tested the network using subject-level five-fold cross-validation with 100 microCT volumes (11.4 \u03bcm isotropic resolution) from cervical and thoracic vagus nerves stained with phosphotungstic acid from five subjects. We benchmarked the 3D U-Net\u2019s performance against a two-dimensional (2D) U-Net using both standard and anatomy-specific segmentation metrics. Results. Our 3D U-Net generated high-quality segmentations (average Dice similarity coefficient: 0.93). Compared to a 2D U-Net, our 3D U-Net yielded significantly better volumetric overlap, boundary delineation, and fascicle instance detection. The 3D approach reduced anatomical errors (topological and morphological implausibility) by 2.5-fold, provided more consistent inter-slice boundaries, and improved detection of fascicle splits/merges by nearly 6-fold. Significance. Our automated 3D segmentation pipeline provides anatomically accurate 3D maps of peripheral neural morphology from microCT data. The automation allows for high throughput, and the substantial improvement in segmentation quality and anatomical fidelity enhances the reliability of morphological analysis, vagal pathway mapping, and the implementation of realistic computational models. These advancements provide a foundation for understanding the functional organization of the vagus and other peripheral nerves and optimizing PNS therapies.",

    "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

    "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

    "title": "A study on the dreams of Miao and Han college students in Guizhou Province.",
    "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of intercellular communication, yet their molecular profiles across tissues and species remain poorly characterized, particularly due to currently available methods requiring a large amount of biological material (tissue or biofluids). Here, we established a workflow allowing the deep phenotyping of EV cargos starting from single samples of human and mouse origin. We took advantage of standardised EV isolation procedures and multi-omic techniques for the isolation and analysis of EVs from brain and plasma of human and mouse, integrating flow cytometric profiling, proteomics, miRNA sequencing, and fatty acid profiling. Here we report specific brain-derived EVs proteome, enriched in neuronal and glial proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids profiles, and distinct miRNAs. At the periphery, we also report plasma-derived EVs signatures reflecting immune, metabolic, and systemic transport functions. Despite these expected material-specific differences, EVs from the same source displayed greater similarity across species than EVs from different material, supporting the translational relevance of mouse models. Importantly, using state-of-the-art miRNA profiling approach, we identified novel EV-specific miRNAs in human and mouse brain EVs, potentially allowing the exploration of new roles in neuronal signalling. Overall, we report here a method enabling deep multi-omic characterization from minimal starting material, offering a practical approach for studies with limited biological samples. These findings also demonstrate that the origin strongly shapes EV composition, highlighting conserved and species-specific molecular features, and provide a scalable framework for multi-omic investigations of EV biology.",

    "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
    "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "title": "PyVq: A vector quantization library for Python",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> PyVq is a Python library for vector quantization. It helps reduce the size of high-dimensional vectors like vector embeddings. It can help with memory use and also make similarity search faster.</p> <p>Currently, PyVq has these features.</p> <ul> <li>Implementations for BQ, SQ, PQ, and TSVQ algorithms.</li> <li>Support for SIMD acceleration and multi-threading.</li> <li>Support for zero-copy operations.</li> <li>Support for Euclidean, cosine, and Manhattan distances.</li> <li>A uniform API for all quantizer types.</li> <li>Storage reduction of 50 percent or more for input vectors.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> AI and ML engineers who optimize vector storage in production. Data scientists who work with high-dimensional embedding datasets. Python developers who want vector compression in their applications. For example, to speed up semantic search.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> I'm aware of very few similar libraries for Python. There is a package called vector-quantize-pytorch that implements a few quantization algorithms in PyTorch. However, there are a few big differences between the PyVq and vector-quantize-pytorch. PyVq's main usefulness is for storage reduction. It can help reduce the storage size for vector data in RAG applications and speed up search. Vector-quantize-pytorch is mainly for deep learning tasks. It helps speed up model training.</p> <p><strong>Why I Made This</strong> I started PyVq because it is an extension of its parent project Vq (which is a vector quantization library for Rust). More people are familiar with Python than Rust, including AI engineers and data scientists, so I made PyVq to make Vq available to a broader audience and make it more useful.</p> <p><strong>Source code</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/CogitatorTech/vq/tree/main/pyvq\">https://github.com/CogitatorTech/vq/tree/main/pyvq</a></p> <p><strong>Installation</strong></p> <pre><code>pip install pyvq </code></pre> <p>pip install pyvq</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Pomegranate7508\"> /u/No_Pomegranate7508 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlm4hf/pyvq_a_vector_quantization_library_for_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlm4hf/pyvq_a_vector_quantization_library_for_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "title": "Resting-state and task-related neurometabolite levels differentially relate to cortical excitability in the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortex",
    "content": "Background. Normal brain function requires a dynamic balance between inhibition and excitation. While magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) quantifies the chief inhibitory and excitatory neurometabolites, GABA and glutamate-glutamine (Glx), the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) provides a complementary measure of cortical inhibition-excitation dynamics via transcranial evoked potentials (TEPs). However, the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and TEPs is unclear. Objective. To characterize the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and TEPs, as a function of TEP component, TMS pulse type, brain region, neurometabolite, and MRS brain state. Methods. Twenty-five young healthy adults completed a 4-day protocol. Sessions 1 and 2 involved screening, anatomical MRI, and functional MRI localization of DLPFC. In session 3, single- and paired-pulse TMS-EEG were applied over SM1 and DLPFC. Session 4 included resting-state and motor-task-related MRS of SM1 and DLPFC. Results. In SM1, task-related GABAergic tone strongly predicted early to mid-latency TEPs. In DLPFC, local early to mid-latency TEPs showed no relationship to neurometabolites, whereas late and global TEP outcomes revealed some links. The later N100 TEP was the only component consistently modulated by paired-pulse TMS. Task-related MRS measures consistently outperformed resting-state measures in predicting TEPs for SM1, while the opposite was true for DLPFC. Conclusions. Single-pulse TEPs reliably index the local inhibitory tone in SM1, with limited added value from paired-pulse paradigms. These findings support the use of single-pulse TEPs as accessible markers of cortical inhibition, especially for SM1, and may inform biomarkers and strategies for individualized neuromodulation.",

The goals of this study are (1a) to construct a white matter neonatal brain-age model including full-term and preterm neonates from a large publicly-available data set, (1b) to evaluate the accuracy of this model for characterizing the preterm brain from the same data set; (2) to determine if a similar model can predict brain-age based on clinical MRI scans from high-risk neonates born preterm; and (3) to evaluate whether this predictive model provides information about the infant's health beyond conventional clinical and demographic measures. We developed brain-age prediction models using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-derived white matter features from two datasets: (1) the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP; 368 healthy infants) and (2) a clinical sample collected at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH; 162 high-risk preterm infants). White matter features demonstrated strong predictive performance in the dHCP dataset (within 3.9 days) and the LPCH clinical dataset (within 6.6 days). However, brain-age metrics (i.e., brain-age gap) showed no significant associations with health complications measured by a composite score of common prematurity complications. While tractometry-derived brain-age models accurately characterize brain maturation in the neonatal brain, their sensitivity to clinical complications in preterm infants appears limited. Global white matter maturation measures derived from clinical grade data may be insufficiently sensitive to capture the cumulative burden of prematurity-related morbidities, suggesting need for multimodal or longitudinal biomarkers.",

    "title": "Neural Measures of Human Decision Making Track Evidence Accumulation in Learned Space",
    "content": "Neural decision-making flexibly integrates evidence across sensory, mnemonic, and semantic domains. Yet all prior demonstrations involve evidence that is either directly available in stimuli or retrieved from established representations. A fundamental question remains: does neural evidence accumulation extend to decisions based on evidence that must be computed through learned representational transformations? Here we show it does. We recorded scalp EEG while participants classified continuously-oriented visual stimuli into discrete categories defined by an experimenter-imposed boundary. Category-level evidence was operationalized as category coherence, or the angular distance between each stimulus and the learned boundary. We predicted that if neural decision mechanisms are truly domain-general, the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), a scalp EEG potential indexing evidence accumulation, should scale with category coherence, and individual differences in CPP sensitivity should correlate with computational drift rates. Both predictions were supported: CPP slopes increased monotonically with category coherence, and individual differences in CPP slopes correlated with individual differences in drift rates across participants. These findings reveal that the brain's decision machinery treats evidence identically regardless of its representational origin - whether externally available, pre-existing, or computed through learned transformations.",

    "title": "Large-scale brain network differences during deliberate and spontaneous mind-wandering in a sustained attention task: An electroencephalography source-level connectivity study",
    "content": "Mind-wandering (MW), the shift of attention away from an ongoing task, can be classified as either deliberate or spontaneous, depending on whether these internal thoughts arise intentionally or unintentionally. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging-based resting state studies have shown that spontaneous MW traits are positively correlated with coupling within the default mode network (DMN), whereas deliberate MW traits are positively correlated with coupling both within the DMN and between the DMN and control- or attention-related networks. However, state-based functional connectivity during each MW episode remains unknown. Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigated how deliberate and spontaneous MW differentially involve state-based large-scale network interactions during a sustained attention task using electroencephalography (EEG), which captures rapid network dynamics. Thirty-one participants performed the gradual-onset continuous performance task using 64-channel EEG. Mental states were classified via experience-sampling probes as on-task, deliberate, or spontaneous MW. EEG data from 1-s pre-probe epochs were analyzed using source estimation and the weighted phase lag index to assess functional connectivity within and across the DMN, control network (CN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and salience network (SN) in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Relative to both spontaneous MW and the on-task state, deliberate MW was characterized by significantly stronger alpha band functional connectivity. A prominent connectivity cluster was centered on the right frontal operculum-insula of the SN, linking regions across the SN, CN, and DMN. In addition, deliberate MW exhibited enhanced SN-DAN-DMN coupling compared with the on-task state. By contrast, spontaneous MW did not show significant connectivity differences relative to the on-task state in any frequency band. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha band network interactions centered on the SN may contribute to the intentional regulation of internally directed thought during deliberate MW.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have immense potential regarding the provision of therapies for disorders of development, but to date have typically been created for non-linguistic disorders such as ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Here we present a BCI that aims to improve linguistic phonological processing in developmental dyslexia. Phonological 'deficits' are considered a core feature of dyslexia across languages. A non-invasive EEG-BCI relying on auditory inputs and visual feedback was developed to optimise brain patterns related to phonology (speech-sound processing). These patterns were identified using Temporal Sampling (TS) theory, which proposes that phonological difficulties in dyslexia are related to impaired auditory processing of amplitude envelope rise times and low-frequency speech envelope information <10 Hz. These impairments are thought to affect automatic features of speech processing from birth, impairing the development of a phonological system. Adults with and without a diagnosis of developmental dyslexia played the BCI for 16 sessions, and received pre- and post-testing regarding phonological awareness and single word and nonword reading skills. Significant associations between their BCI scores (a measure of BCI learning) and improvements in syllable stress discrimination, nonword reading and amplitude rise time discrimination were found. The data are interpreted with respect to TS theory.",

    "title": "Long-Term Expression and Safety of AAV1-Mediated PI3K\u03b4 Overexpression in the Adult Rat Cortex",
    "content": "Mature CNS neurons are incapable of sufficiently regenerating their axons following spinal cord injury (SCI). This is largely due to developmental changes in epigenetic control leading to suppression of axon growth transcriptomic profile, leading to a shift towards synapse function support. Recently, manipulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway through PI3K{delta} overexpression in cortical neurons enhanced axonal regeneration of corticospinal tract axons, which was accompanied by functional recovery monitored for up to 16 weeks. However, PI3K is more widely known for its role as an oncogene, and since overexpression is achieved by the use of AAVs, valid safety concerns are raised as it is unknown what the long-term consequences of sustained PI3K{delta} expression in the brain are, which may be necessary to achieve complete re-establishment of the motor pathway. In this study, AAV1-hSYN-PIK3CD was injected into the motor cortex of rats, which survived for 1 year. Comparison with uninjected control animals reveal stable PI3K{delta} expression and sustained pathway activation through increased pS6. PI3K{delta}-treated animals show absence of tumour formation, neural soma hypertrophy, glial cell activation, or haematological or biochemical abnormalities. Thus, long-term neuronal PI3K{delta} expression appears to be well tolerated and may provide a safe and durable strategy to promote functional repair following SCI.",

    "title": "Beyond the Focus of Expansion: Retinal curl as a functional signal for heading estimation",
    "content": "Prevailing models aiming at explaining heading assume that humans need to recover the Focus of Expansion (FOE) while filtering out rotational flow (curl) caused by eye movements. We propose an alternative: the visual system utilizes retinal curl directly to estimate heading, rendering the explicit recovery of the FOE unnecessary. Stationary participants viewed simulated walking paths on a large screen while fixating on ground targets at varying eccentricities -a natural behavior inducing sustained retinal curl. Participants continuously reported perceived heading. To isolate the role of rotational flow, we employed a real-time manipulation that kept translational flow constant while the foveal curl component was either intact, cancelled, or overcancelled. Under natural conditions, participants exhibited systematic heading biases opposite the direction of gaze. Crucially, these biases vanished in the 'cancelled curl' condition, identifying retinal curl as the specific driver of perceptual bias. We modeled these results using a simple feedback controller and a ring-attractor neural network featuring gaze-contingent inhibition and a 'straight-ahead' prior. These findings suggest the brain exploits the geometry of gaze stabilization to simplify navigation, treating retinal curl as a functional signal rather than noise to be filtered.",

However, the impact of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain, independently of Tau aggregates, remains unclarified. METHODS: We used a mouse model with conditional mapt knocking-down in forebrain of 5-7 months old animals (cTau-KO), a virus-driven selective Tau knockdown in wild-types (WT) and Tau re-expression approaches, accompanied by neurostructural, epigenetic, proteomic, electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral analyses. RESULTS: Loss of Tau in the adult brain of cTau-KOs triggers neuronal atrophy and malfunction, epigenetic as well cognitive and mood deficits. Importantly, these perturbations were confirmed by selective Tau loss in WT adult brain and reverted by Tau re-expression or pharmacologically-induced epigenetic correction in cTau-KOs. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the contribution of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain malfunction that could be relevant in diverse brain pathologies beyond AD, associated to Tau and its dysfunction.",

    "title": "Data quality biases normative models derived from fetal brain MRI",
    "content": "Normative modeling is increasingly used to characterize typical growth trajectories and identify atypical neurodevelopment, including early brain development using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired before birth. Recent work has emphasized the importance of large sample sizes for accurate and robust centile estimation. In this study, we investigate how image quality influences fetal brain normative models, a critical factor in this context where MRI is acquired on a moving fetus in utero. Using a multi-centric cohort of 635 fetal MRI scans, we applied a standardized visual quality control (QC) protocol with continuous quality ratings. We fit normative models for multiple brain structures under progressively relaxed QC stringency, and quantified the deviations in centile estimates relative to a high-quality reference subgroup. Our results showed that including lower-quality data systematically biased normative centiles, with the strongest effects observed in the outer centiles, particularly the lower tail (1st-10th). Bias increased progressively as QC stringency was relaxed and could not be attributed solely to the number of subjects used to fit the models. Quality-induced bias was structure-dependent, and often not visually apparent at the segmentation level. These findings highlight that image quality is an important source of bias in normative fetal brain modeling, and that increasing sample size at the expense of quality may systematically affect centile estimates, potentially jeopardizing the utility of the model.",

    "title": "Biophysically realistic network-level transport model of tau progression with exosome-mediated release and uptake processes",
    "content": "The spatiotemporal progression of tau aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's follows the brain's structural connectome, yet a profound gap exists between the slow macroscopic spread observed over years and the rapid protein kinetics occurring over hours. Current graph-diffusion models fail to reconcile this timescale disparity or incorporate the cellular mechanisms driving transmission. Here, we advance the Network Transport Model (NTM) to bridge these scales by integrating directional active transport along microtubules, continuous toxic tau production, and exosome-mediated trans-neuronal release and uptake. This framework constitutes one of the most mechanistically complete and biologically detailed models of tau spread on the whole brain to date, representing a significant innovation in how multiscale proteinopathies are simulated. To overcome the computational complexity of the underlying partial differential equations, we developed a quasi-static approximation that separates fast axonal transport from slow network-wide exchange. Simulations on the whole-brain mouse connectome demonstrate that this framework emergently replicates empirical tau propagation patterns without the need for case-specific empirical fitting. Our results identify trans-neuronal release and uptake rates as the primary mechanistic \"bottleneck\" on macroscopic spread, providing a biologically grounded explanation for the disease's slow progression. Furthermore, we find that high aggregation rates can paradoxically sequester tau within neurons, limiting global transmission, while transport polarity (anterograde vs. retrograde) fundamentally dictates spatial patterning. By linking molecular mechanics to system-wide pathology, this model provides a predictive \"in-silico\" framework to evaluate how cellular-targeted interventions might alter the trajectory of tauopathic dementias.",

    "content": "There is a pressing need for effective alternatives to opioid analgesics, the development of which requires the identification of novel anti-nociceptive drug targets. Here, we have further investigated the anti-nociceptive properties of a GPR35 agonist, cromolyn, in an in vitro model of inflammatory sensitisation. We used ratiometric Ca2+ imaging of cultured sensory neurons to examine the effect of cromolyn on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-mediated sensitisation of the pro-nociceptive ion channel, transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1). The sensitisation of TRPV1 by PGE2 was inhibited by cromolyn in a GPR35-dependent manner. These observations provide further evidence in support of an anti-nociceptive role for GPR35, highlighting the potential use of GPR35 agonists as analgesics.",

    "title": "A novel protocol for the efficient generation of all three major hippocampal neuronal sub-populations from human pluripotent stem cells",
    "content": "The diverse computational functions of the human hippocampus rely on coordinated interactions among dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 subfields, yet generating all three neuronal identities in vitro - particularly CA1 - has remained challenging. Here we establish a reproducible and modular differentiation protocol that directs human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through dorsomedial telencephalic progenitors to yield DG, CA3, and CA1 neuronal subtypes together with hippocampal regionally specified astrocytes. Early tri-inhibition combined with Sonic hedgehog suppression produced dorsal forebrain progenitors (FOXG1+, PAX6+), while FGF2 treatment supported progenitor maintenance and induced TBR2+ intermediate progenitors. Controlled WNT activation using CHIR99021 drove progressive enrichment of PROX1 hippocampal progenitors across two independent donor lines. Terminal differentiation produced MAP2+/TAU+ neurons that expressed DG (PROX1), CA3 (GRIK4), and CA1 (WFS1, OCT6) markers, with maturing synaptic puncta. Defined progenitors generated long-lived (>400 days) hippocampal organoids exhibiting mixed neuronal-glial populations and spontaneous activity characterized by increased firing rates, high information entropy, and hub-like causal connectivity relative to monolayers, whereas astrocytes-supplemented monolayers displayed intermediate maturation. Population level electrophysiological analysis was also conducted to explore the dynamics of these different cultures. This platform enables systematic experimental control over neuron-astrocyte ratios, culture geometry, and developmental timing, providing a foundation for mechanistic studies of human hippocampal development, circuit function, and disease.",

    "title": "CaMKII\u03b1 holoenzymes self-organize into worm-like mesoscale clusters",
    "content": "Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is highly enriched in dendritic spines at concentrations comparable to those of cytoskeletal proteins and plays a central role in synaptic plasticity. During long-term potentiation (LTP), CaMKII further accumulates in spines. However, the mechanisms governing its higher-order organization remain poorly understood. Here, we use high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize inter-holoenzyme interaction of CaMKII at mesoscopic scales (5-500 nm). Under freely diffusible conditions, CaMKII holoenzymes do not form stable clusters. In contrast, when spatially confined, they assemble into worm-like chain clusters mediated by kinase-domain interactions. These clusters expand upon activation, concomitant with the dissociation of the regulatory segment. Notably, the CaMKII P212L mutant associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, forms extensive clusters even in the basal state. Together, our findings demonstrate that CaMKII-CaMKII interactions drive mesoscale cluster formation and that precise regulation of cluster size and activation-dependent growth might be critical for synaptic signaling.",

    "title": "Direct evidence from kinetic D2O-MRI modeling that the choroid plexus is not the major source of cerebrospinal fluid",
    "content": "The role of the choroid plexus (CP) as the primary source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains controversial. Here, we used dynamic indirect D2O magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4T to investigate whole-brain CSF dynamics in rats. Spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) was performed during intravenous D2O infusion with a temporal resolution of 10.69 s and an in-plane resolution of 150 * 150 um. An echo time of 150.0 ms was employed to effectively suppress signals from brain parenchyma, blood, and interstitial fluid, resulting in preferential visualization of CSF. The ambient and supracerebellar cisterns (AC+SC) exhibited the greatest signal attenuation, reaching 47.32 +- 15.70% of baseline, whereas the lateral ventricles (LV1, LV2) showed smaller reductions (68.73 +- 18.72%-72.64 +- 15.07% of baseline). CSF production rates were quantified using a one-compartment perfusion model. Estimated secretion rates were 0.11 and 0.13 uL/min in the lateral ventricles and 1.30 uL/min in the AC+SC region, indicating a 5.42-fold higher CSF production outside the ventricles. These findings provide direct in vivo evidence that the lateral ventricles are not the primary site of CSF production. The proposed D2O-based dynamic SE-EPI approach is safe, non-invasive, cost-effective, and suitable for widespread application.",

    "title": "Musculoskeletal design of the human shoulder: implications for neuromuscular control",
    "content": "The shoulder complex is a unique musculoskeletal structure capable of versatile motor behaviour yet requiring delicate control. The purpose of our work was to better understand the nature of musculoskeletal redundancy at the shoulder accounting for biomechanical demands and motor control strategies. Using a biomechanical model of the shoulder, we simulated a series of static exertions. Joint moment results from inverse dynamics were combined with an iterative sampling method to survey the landscape of feasible muscle activity patterns. By repeating the sampling process across different numbers of degrees of freedom at the shoulder, we demonstrate how emergent solutions are shaped by the biomechanical demands at each of the shoulder joints. Furthermore, we observed that the degree of musculoskeletal redundancy appears to be higher among the scapulohumeral muscles than the thoracohumeral and thoracoscapular muscles. Finally, we found that many of the muscle activity patterns requiring similar effort costs as the minimal effort solution have similar activation profiles, but there can be a wide range of possibilities especially at greater task intensities. Altogether, the simulations provide insight into neuromuscular control and musculoskeletal model decision-making process for the shoulder.",

    "title": "Impaired development of the medial olivocochlear system in a KCNQ4-deficient mouse model.",
    "content": "The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system modulates outer hair cell (OHC) excitability and protects cochlea from overstimulation. Cholinergic activation of alpha9alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) triggers Ca+2 influx, activating BK and SK2 Ca+2-dependent K+; channels, and K+ extrusion through KCNQ4 to restore membrane potential. KCNQ4-loss causes chronic depolarization, OHC dysfunction, and hearing loss. Here, we investigated how KCNQ4 deficiency affects cochlear efferent synapse development and organization. Using confocal immunofluorescence, we analyzed efferent innervation in the organ of Corti of Kcnq4-/- (KO) and Kcnq4+/+ (WT) mice at 2, 3, 4, and 10 postnatal weeks (W). At 2 W, efferent terminals were similarly distributed between basal and lateral OHC membrane domains in both genotypes. During maturation, WT mice exhibited complete relocation of MOC terminals to the basal domain, whereas KO mice showed delayed maturation, with some terminals laterally displaced up to 10 W. KCNQ4 absence was associated with reduced number and volume of efferent boutons on OHCs. Milder morphometric alterations were observed in efferent boutons within the inner hair cell region. At the molecular level, qPCR revealed downregulation of alpha10 nAChR subunit, BK, and SK2 transcripts in KO at 4 W, with recovery to 10 W. Despite this recovery, BK protein showed reduced expression, mislocalization, and disorganized synaptic plaques in OHCs. KO also displayed age-dependent upregulation of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and calretinin, suggesting compensatory responses to altered Ca+2 homeostasis. Together, these findings demonstrate that KCNQ4 is essential for OHC repolarization, maturation and maintenance of cochlear efferent synapses.",

    "title": "Evolution of visual time throughout goal driven action learning",
    "content": "Timing is intimately woven into human cognition and behaviour, underscoring people's ability of comprehending speech, playing instruments and competing in sports. Converging evidence suggests that our perceptual experience of time is grounded in our ability to control actions: time processing leverages motor control neural machinery, and perceived time is significantly distorted in proximity of action. However, the dynamic interplay between timing and action systems remains unexplored, particularly in goal-directed contexts where action control is gradually refined through practice. Through combined behavioural, neural and modelling approaches, we investigate how time processing gradually evolves as participants gain experience in goal-driven manual reaching actions, varying in terms of action-plan specificity. Participants judged brief visual durations while preparing hand movements aimed at visual targets displayed on a monitor. Subjective time expanded in the foreperiod preceding action onset, and this effect increased over trials, mirroring gradual improvements in action readiness as motor plans became more rapidly and efficiently deployed. Representation Similarity Analysis, integrating electroencephalographic and behavioural data, reveals that actions shape timing through independent mechanisms: planning specific behaviours shapes how duration information is written into timekeeping neural circuits as stimuli unfold (encoding). Parallely, more general aspects of motor engagement and anticipation shape how duration information is read-out from timing circuits following stimulus presentation (decoding). These findings highlight a dynamic, learning-driven coupling between perceptual time and motor control, where subjective time is recalibrated as goal-directed action preparation is optimized, shaped through independent time encoding and decoding mechanisms.",

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "title": "Neuronal integrity is altered in the ipsilesional hand sensory territory in late stroke",
    "content": "Background: Sensorimotor remapping plays a crucial role in the rehabilitation of hand function after stroke. While motor remapping has been intensively investigated at various levels, from functional to metabolic, limited attention has been given to somatosensory cortical remapping. This study extends our previous work showing functionally relevant metabolic alterations in radiologically normal-appearing or spared motor cortices, predominantly in the ipsilesional (stroke-injured) hemisphere, during the chronic phase of stroke. Precisely, we investigated the metabolic status of the ipsilesional primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and its relation to hand impairment in late stroke. Methods: Fourteen individuals with a chronic (mean {+/-} SD, 21.1 {+/-} 36.9 months post-onset) ischemic subcortical stroke, exhibiting moderate hand impairment (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity, 44.8 {+/-} 20.9; Jamar dynamometer, 54.1% {+/-} 40.9% of the non-paretic hand), but without sensory deficits, and ten matched healthy controls participated. MR Spectroscopy markers of neuronal status (N-acetylaspartate) and neuronal-glial glutamatergic cycle/neurotransmission (glutamate-glutamine complex) were measured in the ipsilesional S1 (3T, Allegra Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Between-group comparison of brain-tissue-corrected levels of these markers (LCModel, SPM12, MATLAB 2023a) and correlation analyses were performed (SPSS v26). Results: Compared with controls, patients showed significantly lower N-acetylaspartate levels (by 14.5%, p = 0.03) but no significant alterations in glutamate-glutamine levels (by -4.0%, p = 0.6). Significant correlations were found between N-acetylaspartate and the glutamate-glutamine complex in patients (p = 0.02), but not in controls (p = 0.06). No significant correlations were found between S1 markers and hand impairment (p > 0.05 for all). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with lower cortical excitability in the ipsilesional S1 in chronic stroke survivors. Further work on the functional relevance of such findings, using larger sample sizes, is warranted.",

    "content": "<p>Hey all, Justin here. I previously built Phind, the AI search engine for developers.<p>One of the biggest problems we had there was figuring out what went wrong with bad searches. We had tons of searches per day, but less than 1% of users gave any explicit feedback. So we were either manually digging through searches or making general system improvements and hoping they helped.<p>This problem gets harder with agents. Traces are longer and more complex. It takes more effort to review them, so I'm building a tool that lets you analyze LLM outputs directly to help developers of LLM apps and agents understand where things are breaking and why.<p>I've put together a demo using browser-use agent traces (gpt-5): <a href=\"https://trails-red.vercel.app/viewer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://trails-red.vercel.app/viewer</a><p>It's early, but I have lots of ideas - live querying of past failures for currently-running agents, preference models to expand sparse signal data.<p>Would love feedback on the demo. Also if you're building agents and have 10k+ traces per day that you're not looking at but would like to, I'd love to talk.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46736978\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46736978</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Probing the Glymphatic System Using Optical Imaging and Mathematical Modeling",
    "content": "The glymphatic system is a macroscopic waste clearance pathway in the central nervous system (CNS), crucial to maintaining neural homeostasis through the exchange of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF). Impairments in this system have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, emphasizing the need to understand and potentially improve glymphatic clearance. We investigate tracer diffusion and transport in the glymphatic system by combining optical imaging in rats and mathematical modeling using a partial differential equation of advection-diffusion type. The experimental conditions differ in the levels of isoflurane-induced anesthesia (1.5, 2 and 3%) and the molecular weight of the tracer compounds (1 and 160 kDa). The optimal parameters show a close clustering of the diffusion coefficients and a wider spread of the flow velocities of the cerebrospinal fluid. Our work contributes to a better understanding of flow processes in the brain parenchyma during sleep.",

    "content": "Epigenetics connect nature with nurture and can help explain how genes, experiences, and the environment influence gene expression to promote individual differences in behavior and mental health. However, how these perturbations induce epigenetic changes across various regions of the brain remains largely unknown. To visualize changes in brain's epigenetic landscape at a glance, we develop EpiBrain, a method utilizing whole-brain imaging and registration to capture epigenetic changes in the entire zebrafish brain in a snapshot. Using this method, we uncovered brain-wide epigenetic changes induced by brain activity, chemical exposures, and genetic mutations. We found that gadd45b, an immediate early gene with epigenetic modulatory activity, mediates experience-induced epigenetic changes in the brain, and that these changes contribute to brain activity and behavioral alterations. EpiBrain enables rapid and unbiased assessment of whole-brain epigenetic changes following physiological and disease-relevant perturbations and facilitates mechanistic discoveries at the molecular level.",

    "content": "Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias are rapidly increasing in prevalence, yet disease-modifying therapies remain largely focused on amyloid-beta with limited efficacy against tau pathology and neuroinflammation, key drivers of neurodegeneration and clinical decline. Dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1a (Dyrk1a) phosphorylates tau and amyloid precursor protein and regulates inflammatory signaling, positioning it as a convergence point across pathogenic pathways. We show that brain Dyrk1a protein levels are consistently elevated across ADRDs, replicating findings in AD, confirming prior observations in Picks disease, and demonstrating dysregulation in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy. We developed DYR533, a selective, orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant Type 1 Dyrk1a kinase inhibitor that also inhibits autophosphorylation and reduces kinase abundance. Across three mouse models (3xTg-AD, PS19, Ts65Dn), DYR533 reduced pathological tau hyperphosphorylation, attenuated neuroinflammation, ameliorated amyloidosis, and improved anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory, collectively supporting Dyrk1a inhibition and DYR533 as a therapeutic strategy for ADRD.",

    "content": "Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is a transmembrane protein that mediates neuron-glia interactions and regulates dendritic spine growth and neuronal migration. Mutations in the CNTNAP2 gene are linked to autism and epilepsy. Younger Cntnap2 KO mice mimic autism phenotypes, while older mice are a model for epilepsy. Thus, comparing behavioral phenotypes across different ages is needed to better understand the age dependent development of disordered brain networks in Cntnap2 mutants. Male and female Cntnap2 KO and WT controls were tested across different age groups (4, 5, 7, 9, and ~11 months) using digging, stimulus (reactivity), and nesting assays. Older Cntnap2 KO mice (7, 9, and ~11 months) showed a significant increase in home cage reactivity (stimulus) assay compared to younger mice at 4 and 5 months of age. Similar trends were observed in male and female Cntnap2 KO mice. No significant differences were observed in WT controls. A significant difference in digging assay was observed in KO female mice between younger (4 month) and older mice post nest removal. An age-dependent significant reduction in nesting behavior was observed in female KO mice; however, no difference was observed in the WT controls. Immunohistochemical analysis showed age dependent change interneuron and microglial network in Cntnap2 KO mice. Our findings suggest disruption in home cage behavior and reactivity in older pre-epileptic Cntnap2 KO mice indicating an age-dependent network alteration and behavior deficits.",

    "content": "Deletion of the SNORD116 non-coding RNA is associated with the development of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). We and others have identified NHLH2/Nhlh2 as a putative SNORD116/Snord116 target and in this study report that Nhlh2 and Snord116 are co-expressed in forebrain neurons. Nhlh2 mRNA is found predominantly in the nucleus of Snord116+ hypothalamic neurons but is evenly distributed between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in Snord116- neurons. A hypothalamic cell line co-expressing Nhlh2 and Snord116 recapitulates this nuclear partitioning pattern for Nhlh2 only when the putative Snord116 binding site is present in the 3-prime untranslated region of the Nhlh2 mRNA. In a PWS mouse model (Snord116del), Nhlh2 mRNA levels are unchanged in Pomc neurons but are reduced and primarily cytoplasmic in lateral hypothalamic neurons. These findings demonstrate that Snord116 regulates mRNA levels via mRNA partitioning, fundamentally altering our understanding of gene expression networks in PWS.",

    "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
    "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

The focus is on <strong>practical implementation</strong>, using libraries like <code>statsmodels</code>, <code>scikit-learn</code>, <code>PyTorch</code>, and <code>Darts</code>. I also dive into real-world topics like handling messy time series data, feature engineering, and model evaluation.</p> <p>I\u2019m published the book on <strong>Gumroad</strong> and <strong>LeanPub</strong>.

    "title": "Regional heterogeneity shapes macroscopic wave dynamics of the human and non-human primate cortex",
    "content": "Growing evidence indicates that macroscopic cortical activity is dominated by propagating waves of excitation. However, many computational models of such wave dynamics assume that the cortex is a spatially homogeneous medium, ignoring the rich regional variations in cellular, molecular, and physiological properties that are known to shape how brain activity evolves through both space and time. Here, we develop a general framework grounded in neural field theory to model how regional heterogeneities in diverse cortical properties shape spatiotemporal brain activity evolving on cortical surface meshes. This enables high resolution, vertex-level simulations without requiring predefined parcellations. The model requires only a standard mesh model of the cortical manifold and a spatial heterogeneity map, providing a biologically grounded and computationally efficient framework that can be generalised to human and non-human species. Using multiple cellular, molecular, and physiological maps in humans--and analogous maps in macaques and marmosets--we show that our model can consistently recapitulate known relationships between regional heterogeneities and variations in cortical wave speed. In particular, we find that models parameterised by heterogeneities in intracortical myelin and excitation-inhibition balance yield the largest performance improvements relative to spatially homogeneous models. Our results identify a key role for regional variations in myelin, receptor, and genetic architecture in shaping the spatial patterning of macroscale cortex-wide activity that is conserved across primate species with diverse cortical geometries.",

    "title": "Astrocytic response to traumatic brain injury to rescue neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction through mitochondrial transfer",
    "content": "As highly dynamic organelles, mitochondria play an essential role in neuronal survival and synaptic function. Excitotoxicity is as a critical factor that promotes mitochondrial dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intercellular mitochondrial transfer and exogenous mitochondrial transplantation are emerging concepts to understand mitochondrial trafficking in response to mitochondrial dysfunction; however, robust in vivo evidence remains limited on the extent of these processes in the central nervous system (CNS). There is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of mitochondrial transfer mechanisms under both normal physiological conditions and after experimental TBI. Mouse lines expressing mitochondrial green-fluorescent dendra-2 (mtD2) and GFP (mtGFP) targeted to inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively, were used to study astrocyte-specific (Aldh1l1-CreER; mtD2f/f-AmtD2 and Aldh1l1-CreER; mtGFPf/f-AmtGFP) and neuron-specific (CamK2aCre; mtD2f/f-NmtD2 and CamK2aCre; mtGFPf/f-NmtGFP) mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in acute TBI and excitotoxicity. At 24 hrs following TBI, neurons in the NmtD2 mouse brain exhibited rapid and significant alterations in mitochondrial morphology, including changes in total mitochondrial volume, volume distribution, and sphericity. Synaptic neuronal (SN) mitochondria display robust deficits in mitochondrial bioenergetics and complex protein levels while non-synaptic neuronal (NSN) mitochondria show State III bioenergetics and complex proteins at control levels. These findings are accompanied by a marked increase in astrocyte-derived mitochondria (AmtGFP) transfer to neurons at 24 hrs post-injury, compared to control animals, but no increase in transfer to neuronal synapses. While TBI also altered astrocytic mitochondrial morphology in the cortex, astrocytic mitochondrial bioenergetics remained preserved. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of astrocytes revealed significant transcriptional reprogramming following TBI, characterized by the upregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial homeostasis and the machinery for organelle trafficking. In vitro co-cultures of primary cortical astrocytes and neurons demonstrated that astrocytes can transfer mitochondria to neurons via direct contact and that NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity further enhanced this astrocyte-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer. Furthermore, astrocytic-derived extracellular vesicles containing mitochondria (EV-mito) deliver mitochondria to neurons and EV-mediated mitochondrial transfer significantly ameliorated NMDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in primary cortical neurons. Together, these findings show that astrocytes take on a TBI-related phenotype that facilitates dynamic changes in mitochondrial networks and mitochondrial trafficking to neurons. Astrocytic transfer of respiratory-competent mitochondria support is an intrinsic neuroprotective response to injury that supports mitochondrial function in neuronal soma, dendrites, and axons but not at the neuronal synapse. Finally, we show therapeutic potential of exogenous mitochondrial transfer, particularly via EV-mito, for treating neurological disorders associated with excitotoxicity, such as TBI.",

    "title": "Single-cell-resolved spatial multi-omics identifies mTOR-driven neuronal and astroglial pathogenicity underlying epileptogenic focal cortical dysplasia",
    "content": "Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) is a malformation of cortical development caused by somatic mutations in the mTOR signaling pathway. Two hallmark pathological cell types in FCDII, dysmorphic neurons (DNs) and balloon cells (BCs), arise as a result of somatic mutations in the mTOR signaling pathway and are implicated in the pathophysiology of drug-resistant epilepsy. However, how these somatic mutations reshape cell states within the human cortex remains poorly understood. Here, we integrate imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (iST), single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and proteomics of surgically resected FCDIIb tissue to define the transcriptional and proteomic profiles of DNs and BCs. Spatial mapping of iST data resolved transcriptional signatures in histologically validated DNs and BCs within FCDIIb sections. Integrative omics analysis further revealed that DNs show upregulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and p53-CROT metabolic programs accompanied by suppression of synaptic signaling, whereas BCs exhibit transcriptional signatures of reactive astrocytes with increased phagocytic and immune-like activity. These data delineate cell-type-specific consequences of somatic mTOR pathway mutations at single-cell resolution and reveal previously unrecognized metabolic and immunoregulatory mechanisms contributing to epileptogenesis in drug-resistant epilepsy. Our study establishes a spatial multi-omics framework for dissecting human cortical malformations and highlights potential therapeutic targets for drug-resistant epilepsy.",

    "title": "Super-resolved, three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics reveals cell-type and brain-region-specific modulation of key epitranscriptomic switches following adolescent alcohol exposure",
    "content": "Epitranscriptomic mechanisms dynamically regulate neuronal function through gene expression, but their precise roles in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders remain to be fully elucidated. A major obstacle to advancing such studies is the absence of a methodology for precise, cell-type and brain-region-specific quantification of critical epitranscriptomic regulators under these complex brain conditions. To overcome this challenge, we developed a super-resolved, three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics method to quantify key epitranscriptomic switches in intact brains. Using this method, we quantified the expression of Mettl3, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase enzyme recently shown to be upregulated in the amygdala after adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure in rats. We observed a significant increase in cytoplasmic Mettl3 mRNA in neurons, but not in astrocytes or microglia, within the adult central amygdala and the CA1 and dentate gyrus of hippocampus following AIE. In contrast, no significant changes were observed across neurons, astrocytes, or microglia within the basolateral amygdala or the hippocampal CA3. Additionally, we found both the cytoplasmic density and subcellular localization of Mettl3 mRNA were dependent on the specific cell types and brain subregions examined. These results suggest that AIE increases Mettl3 expression in a highly cell-type-specific and spatially heterogeneous manner, underscoring the necessity of high-resolution spatial transcriptomics methods for studying transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic regulations under neurological conditions.",

    "title": "IGF1 peptide targets Rett Syndrome astrocytes to degrade IGF binding protein, rescue synaptogenesis and restore mitochondrial function",
    "content": "Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, leads to profound synaptic and circuit deficits in the brain. While neurons have historically been the focus of RTT pathology, emerging evidence implicates astrocytes in non-cell autonomous mechanisms that impair synaptic structure, function and development. Here, we uncover a central role for astrocyte-secreted IGFBP2 in mediating these deficits and demonstrate that treatment with an IGF1-derived peptide restores synapse formation by promoting IGFBP2 degradation. Using an indirect astrocyte-neuron co-culture system, we show that astrocytes derived from RTT model mice suppress excitatory synapse formation in wild-type neurons and that this impairment is reversed when RTT astrocytes are treated with IGF1(1-3) peptide. Proteomic analysis reveals elevated levels of IGFBP2 in RTT astrocytes and their conditioned media. IGF1(1-3) peptide treatment leads to proteasomal degradation of IGFBP2, increasing IGF1 bioavailability, restoring mitochondrial function, and enhancing downstream PI3K/Akt signaling in neurons. Our data define a molecular mechanism by which astrocyte dysfunction in RTT can be rescued and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic efficacy of IGF1(1-3) peptide, including Trofinetide, an FDA-approved IGF1 peptide mimetic, in RTT.",

    "title": "An event-based opto-tactile skin",
    "content": "This paper presents a neuromorphic, event-driven tactile sensing system for soft, large-area skin, based on the Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) integrated with a flexible silicone optical waveguide skin. Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4,620 mm probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1,024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations. The system exhibits a detection latency distribution with a characteristic width of 31 ms.",

    "title": "A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Biological Sex Differences in Sleep Spindles and Slow Wave Activity in Adults with and without Insomnia",
    "content": "Mounting evidence shows sex-based differences in sleep experiences and outcomes, including the prevalence of insomnia disorder. However, the impact of biological sex on brain oscillations during sleep remains poorly understood, especially in the context of insomnia disorder. This is a notable gap, given that neurophysiological aspects of sleep are associated with brain health and overall sleep quality. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed data from studies reporting spindle and slow wave activity in adults with and without insomnia disorder. We conducted systematic searches in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, with thirteen studies of normal sleepers (N= 668) reporting sufficient data for random-effects meta-analyses. Compared with males, female normal sleepers had higher spindle density, sigma and delta power. Most studies recruited individuals with primary insomnia, and data pooling for insomnia and mixed groups was not possible due to insufficient statistical reporting. Moreover, group-by-sex interactions were limited, inconsistent, and varied across studies and sample characteristics. Further research is needed to explore sex-specific differences in sleep microarchitecture and their role in normal sleep and the manifestation of insomnia disorder.",

    "title": "Geometric structure of features underlies human VTC object recognition.",
    "content": "The ventral temporal cortex (VTC) plays a crucial role in human object recognition. Within VTC neural space, object-specific domains align with domain-general features, e.g. face- and scene-domain align with the feature distribution of animacy, generating a hierarchical knowledge structure for categorization. However, the neural process of integrating information from VTC to distinguish different objects remains unclear. Here, we employed a combination of ANN modeling, functional MRI, and MEG to investigate how VTC features affect object manifold separability. The representational geometry analysis shows that domain-general features in VTC form a unique structure, different from ANN, to assist object classification. Moreover, VTC dynamically adjusts the geometrical relationship of these features during object recognition, influencing the geometrical properties of object manifolds and, consequently, their separability. These findings advance our understanding of the neural computation involved in VTC object recognition, revealing how downstream neurons can flexibly access category information in diverse recognition tasks.",

    "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

    "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) promotes myelin repair and plasticity in the mouse motor cortex",
    "content": "Cortical myelin loss and oligodendroglial dysfunction, hallmarks of numerous neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, compromise executive, sensory, and cognitive functions by altering circuit activity and integrity. Promoting cortical myelin repair therefore represents a critical therapeutic goal. In this frame, modulation of neuronal activity through non-invasive brain stimulation may represent a promising non-pharmacological approach to support remyelination. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS) in a mouse model of unilateral myelin injury in the motor cortex. A-tDCS was delivered over the contralateral uninjured cortex during a bilateral motor task (locomotion), to enhance the physiological activity of interhemispheric M1-M1 projections and indirectly stimulate the lesioned cortex. When applied during the late phase of demyelination and the onset of repair, A-tDCS accelerated remyelination and increased oligodendroglial survival and maturation in the lesioned cortex, compared with unstimulated controls. Increased myelin was also detected in the directly stimulated uninjured cortex despite unchanged oligodendroglial cell numbers, suggesting de novo myelin formation or remodeling of existing internodes. These structural changes were accompanied by preservation of interhemispheric M1-M1 functional connectivity upon injury. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that A-tDCS promotes cortical myelin repair in vivo, supporting its therapeutic potential for disorders characterized by myelin damage. Notably, the observed effects of tDCS on myelin plasticity in the uninjured cortex - reported here for the first time - reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying tDCS-mediated neuromodulation.",

    "title": "Bright calcium-modulated bioluminescent indicators for activity imaging and red photon-assisted synaptic transmission",
    "content": "Bioluminescent calcium sensors have unique uses in neuroscience and neuroengineering, enabling noninvasive imaging of neuronal activity and contactless activation of opsin-expressing neurons. However, the speed, range, and robustness of non-invasive imaging and rewiring or neuronal activity are limited by the radiance and dynamic range of existing bioluminescent calcium sensors. Here, we report the stepwise engineering of improved cyan-excitable red fluorescent proteins (mCyRFP4 and dCyRFP4), an improved red bioluminescent protein based on NanoLuc and CyRFP4 (Antares3), and an improved bioluminescent calcium sensor based on Antares3 (CaMBI3). Antares3 is 3-fold brighter than its predecessor, while CaMBI3 responds with an overall dynamic range of 24-fold, enabling high-sensitivity detection of calcium dynamics in muscle and neuronal tissues in vivo. Finally, a CaMBI3 variant and a red-shifted opsin ChRmine enabled red photon-assisted synaptic transmission in C. elegans. CaMBI3 thus facilitates genetically targeted non-invasive imaging and rewiring of neural activity in living animals.",

    "title": "Temporal sequence geometry enables odor recognition and generalization",
    "content": "Animals encode sensory stimuli with precisely timed neural activity across modalities. For example, mice can rapidly recognize odors, independent of their concentration, using information relayed from their olfactory bulbs by complex spatiotemporal patterns of mitral and tufted cell (MTC) activity. Yet, it remains unknown how MTC activity patterns are structured, and what role precisely timed activity sequences play in guiding perception. Here we investigated the geometry of MTC odor tuning and the structure of odor response sequences by performing fast 2-photon calcium imaging of hundreds of MTCs with sub-sniff resolution. We constructed a space of MTC tuning using the pairwise correlations between MTC odor responses averaged over a sniff and discovered that odor specific sequential activity traversed this space in smooth, continuous trajectories. Further, we found that the early but not the later part of sequences carried concentration invariant information about odor identity. Finally, inspired by observation that neighboring MTCs in the tuning space are activated together in time independently of the odors presented, we propose a role of activity sequences in training the piriform cortex to learn perceptually generalizable odor representations. To test these ideas, we constructed and analyzed a computational model for sequence-based unsupervised training of synapses from MTCs to the piriform cortex, which revealed that sequential activity across the entire sniff permits perceptual generalization for novel odors, acting as a scaffold for learning relevant activity manifolds between networks.",

    "content": "Senescence of peripheral sensory neurons has recently been associated with increased nociceptive signalling and pain chronification. Whether this association is found across pain conditions and independent study settings remains to be investigated. In this study, we made use of publicly available whole-genome transcriptome data sets on rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissue to investigate pain-related peripheral sensory neuron senescence across pain models and independent study settings. We focused on Cdkn1a (p21) and Cdkn2a (p16) expression levels as two widely-used senescence markers, and to explore their potential role in peripheral sensory neuron senescence. We found that Cdkn1a but not Cdkn2a RNA is significantly increased across different axotomy- and lesion-based neuropathic pain models, but less consistent in other pain models including inflammatory pain. We observed a sex-dependent effect of Cdkn1a upregulation following nerve injury, with significantly increased Cdkn1a RNA levels in DRG cells from female but not male rats. Lastly, Cdkn1a RNA levels are increased among all DRG neuronal subtypes, seem to reach their maximum three to seven days following nerve injury, and afterwards go back to baseline. These data suggest that Cdkn1a upregulation in DRG neurons is a widespread response to nerve injury that is found across independent study settings.",

    "title": "Cortical cognitive processing explains and predicts superior colliculus signals and timing of gaze shifts to multisensory targets.",
    "content": "When goal-directed movements are aimed toward multimodal stimuli, action planning differs compared to the unimodal case in both the spatial and temporal domains, as reflected in specific trends of behavioral response differences in the two conditions. This has been systematically reported in past behavioral and neurophysiological studies; however, a unified neurocognitive theory is yet to be proposed that explains all these findings together based on cognitive processes during the delay period. In our previous paper (Daemi, Harris, & Crawford, 2016) we modeled causal inference in order to determine the spatial location of the goal for saccade. Here, we extend this framework into 1) the temporal domain, and 2) the domain of neural signals. Specifically, we propose that confidence on selecting a winning plan, relative to other alternatives, should influence the timing of execution of the winning action plan, as reflected in known superior colliculus signals and the generated behavior. To model these concepts, we build upon our previous evidence-accumulation decision-making framework and compute an instantaneous measure of confidence based on the relative saliency of the winning motor plan compared to the alternate plans. A winning plan is only initiated when enough evidence is accumulated in its favor. This is realized by introducing an accumulative measure of confidence that integrates the instantaneous measure through time. A threshold is set on the accumulative confidence and a GO command is released whenever it reaches the threshold. We also formalize the computations of how this model may be neurally implemented in the brain, mainly in the projections between the superior colliculus (SC), the basal ganglia, and the cortex. This model produces simulations that replicate and explain several experimental multisensory observations. In the behavioral domain, our model shows how higher reaction times are predicted for multi-modal targets with higher reliability, or with higher spatial or temporal disparities, due to less confidence on a unique cause. In the neurophysiological domain, our model replicates the principal multisensory behaviors observed in SC neurons: 1) the dependence of SC neuronal activity on the spatial and temporal structure of cross-modal stimuli (i.e., spatial and temporal principles), 2) the inverse relationship between stimulus intensity and the magnitude of the elicited multisensory response (i.e., principle of inverse effectiveness). We have also simulated some novel predictions that could guide new experimental studies. Thus, our model provides a unified viewpoint to explain, for the first time, the effects of both spatial and temporal factors on reaction time variability for multisensory targets, and assigns each of these effects to a unique cognitive function upstream from sensorimotor transformations. Our model proposes cognitive significance for multisensory neural principles in SC, by linking them to how the cortex infers a causal structure and calculates confidence on its inference.",

We analyzed multiple independent scRNA-seq datasets to investigate rG4-associated biological functions across AD-relevant cell types and transcriptional states. We discovered that rG4-binding RBPs (RG4BPs) directly regulate essential glial cell functions, which are frequently impaired in AD. At the transcriptional state level, distinct sets of dysregulated RG4BPs correspond to the impaired state-specific biological features of astrocytes and microglia during AD progression, including a shift from an acute protective state to a chronic stress-associated state. This progressive state transition is accompanied by glial exhaustion and accumulated rG4s, which ultimately compromise glial support functions. We report several RG4BPs that are known regulators, including CIRBP, HSP90AA1, VIM, and PICALM, whose altered expression is associated with either pathological activation or severe functional impairment.

Neuroactive substances like nicotine can disrupt this balance and hyperactivate dopaminergic circuits, with combined effects on behavior and neural activity. We use Drosophila larvae to examine nicotine-induced, linked behavioral changes over multiple time scales by integrating high-resolution locomotor analysis with genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Acute nicotine exposure produces concentration-dependent hyperactivity. Manipulations of the dopaminergic system establish dopamine as the main mediator for motor responses, and further exploration establishes the {gamma} lobe of the mushroom body as a key site for nicotine integration. Experiments with long-term and repetitive nicotine exposure suggest sustained circuit excitability. Finally, nicotine exposure history induces nicotine preference, highlighting experience-dependent plasticity contributing to addiction-like behaviors. These results help establish the Drosophila larva as a model organism to elucidate how neuroactive substances reconfigure neural circuits and behavior.",

It automates the selection and fitting of preprocessing steps while producing reusable, fitted artifacts that can be safely applied to validation, test, or production data. The goal is to reduce ad-hoc preprocessing logic and make experiments more reproducible without hiding the underlying transformations.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Atlantic is intended for <strong>machine learning &amp; AI engineers/data scientists or AI practitioners</strong> working with real-world tabular datasets. It\u2019s designed for experimental and production-oriented workflows where preprocessing needs to be reproducible, inspectable, and reusable.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Compared to standard sklearn pipelines or manually defined preprocessing mechanisms, Atlantic focuses on <strong>automatically evaluating multiple preprocessing strategies</strong> instead of relying on fixed choices. While AutoML tools often optimize model selection, Atlantic concentrates specifically on preprocessing decisions and keeps them explicit through a builder-style API, allowing control over each needed preprocessing step.</p> <p><strong>What it\u2019s designed for</strong></p> <ul> <li>Real-world tabular datasets with missing values, mixed feature types, and redundant features</li> <li>Automated selection of preprocessing steps that improve downstream model performance</li> <li>Builder-style pipelines for teams that want explicit control without rewriting preprocessing logic</li> <li>Reusable preprocessing artifacts that can be safely applied to future or production data</li> <li>Adjustable optimization depth depending on time and compute constraints</li> </ul> <p>You can use Atlantic as a fully automated preprocessing stage or compose a custom builder pipeline step by step, depending on how much control you want over each transformation.</p> <p>The package is open-source, pip-installable, and actively maintained.</p> <p><strong>Repositories &amp; Documentation:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/TsLu1s/Atlantic\">https://github.com/TsLu1s/Atlantic</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/atlantic/\">https://pypi.org/project/atlantic/</a></li> </ul> <p>Feel free to explore it, share feedback or optimization ideas, as it would be very appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TsLu1s\"> /u/TsLu1s </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjrcdh/atlantic_automated_data_preprocessing_framework/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjrcdh/atlantic_automated_data_preprocessing_framework/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Basal radial glia (bRG) are key neural progenitors driving human neocortical expansion. They exhibit remarkable morphological heterogeneity, yet the stability and functional significance of their distinct morphotypes remains unclear. Using human cortical brain organoids combined with long-term live imaging and morphology-resolved spatial transcriptomics (CellShape-seq), we show that bRG morphotypes display distinct morphodynamic behaviors, proliferative capacities and transcriptional profiles. While bifurcated bRG remodel extensively during mitosis to produce morphologically diverse progeny, multipolar cells are most morphologically flexible during interphase. Multipolar bRG further show the greatest proliferative capacity and the transcriptional signature related to progenitor state. Bifurcated bRG are least proliferative and are enriched for the multifunctional gene expression regulator YBX1. Pharmacological inhibition of YBX1 depletes bifurcated bRG, reduces neurogenesis, and promotes glial commitment. Our findings link progenitor morphology, gene expression and fate, providing a framework for understanding the cellular logic of human cortical development.",

    "content": "Proximity-based proteomics using TurboID has enabled cell-type specific profiling without the need for cell purification, although major bottlenecks in sample lysis, biotinylated protein enrichment, digestion, and mass spectrometry (MS) parameters have limited depth of proteome coverage. Here, we systematically optimized these variables using TurboID based labeling of BV2 microglia in vitro and brain astrocytes in vivo to define conditions that maximize proteome coverage. In microglia, the optimized protocol using 8 M urea lysis with on-bead S-Trap digestion and data-independent acquisition MS (DIA-MS) identified 4,016 proteins, double the depth of prior studies, and revealed metabolic, ribosomal, lipid-processing, autophagy, and trafficking signatures. Brain astrocyte proteomes were best recovered using SDS lysis with S-Trap digestion and DIA-MS, yielding a proteome of over 3,600 highly enriched proteins, twice the depth of prior astrocyte-TurboID studies. The expanded astrocyte proteomes captured canonical astrocyte markers as well as membrane-associated, vesicular trafficking, and presynaptic protein signatures, consistent with labeling of astrocyte neuron interface regions, including proteins involved in receptor signaling, lipid metabolism, and plasticity at tripartite synapses, and several AD risk proteins. The increased peptide recovery following S-Trap digestion allowed the reduction of starting material to 20 ug protein for DIA-MS, and enabled multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT-MS) proteomics using even smaller samples. When applied to synaptosomes enriched from mouse brains with neuronal TurboID labeling, our pipeline identified a synapse-specific proteome of 2,529 proteins, revealing synaptic, mitochondrial and disease-relevant signatures not detectable in prior studies. By tackling critical bottlenecks from tissue processing to MS, our optimized pipelines enable cell-type and compartment-specific proximity-labeling proteomics to obtain comprehensive biological and disease-relevant insights across various biological fields.",

    "title": "Divergent co-transmission by a predictive motor circuit modulates auditory processing.",
    "content": "During behavior, an animals' movements often stimulate its own sensory receptors. For instance, whether during flight or the production of courtship song, when flies beat their wings they cause mechanosensory disturbances that activate primary auditory neurons in the antennae. However, flight and courtship occur under very different behavioral contexts and temporal-scales. As a consequence, the nervous system contains predictive motor circuits that modify sensory processing in anticipation of self-induced (re-afferent) stimulation. However, it is unclear how information about planned movements can be used to effectively tune specialized sensory processing circuits. Here we describe a predictive motor circuit that releases two transmitters to differentially modify auditory neurons that process sound under different behavioral contexts. In Drosophila, two metathoracic ascending histamine neurons (MtAHNs) become active prior to wing movement and project to the primary auditory network. We found that the MtAHNs co-transmit the neuropeptide Dh44 and histamine, and each suppresses the activity of auditory neurons that are integrated into distinct networks that support escape and courtship, respectively. Additionally, Dh44 has a greater impact on male auditory neurons and suppression by Dh44 occurs over a longer time course than histamine. Disrupting either histamine synthesis or neuropeptide release by the MtAHNs reduces courtship success with an increase in cessation during the wing extension step. Consistent with a role in auditory processing of courtship cues, Dh44 cotransmission is present in Drosophila species that have an auditory component to their courtship displays, but is absent in species that use either purely visual courtship or lack apparent courtship behavior. Finally, the projections of the MtAHNs into auditory centers were missing in snow flies, which are wingless. Our results indicate that divergent cotransmission by predictive motor circuits may represent an efficient means to differentially modulate sensory subnetworks impacted by reafferent feedback.",

    "title": "Comparative effects of inactivation and dopamine receptor agents in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum on performance of action sequences in rats",
    "content": "Rationale: Recent research on habits and skills has produced a wave of new theories regarding the shift in control from medial to lateral regions of the dorsal striatum, and how these regions are implicated in the selected and executed of action sequences. Objectives: To examine the comparative effects of muscimol/baclofen inactivation and dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agents in the dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral (DLS) striatum on the performance of skilled action sequences. Methods: Infusions were made in well-trained rats using the five-step nose poke task to isolate the effects on initiation, execution and termination components of skilled action sequences. Results: DLS inactivation produced sequencing deficits like those observed with pre-training lesions, indicating that the DLS is critical for both the acquisition and performance of sequences. Behaviour was unchanged following DMS inactivation, consistent with models of DMS disengagement following training. Infusions of D1 and D2 antagonists did not alter behaviour, however the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole increased sequence errors at a low dose and reduced sequences at the high dose in the DLS. DLS manipulations impaired sequence initiation and termination as well as reward transitions, while the 'chunking' ballistic response pattern was largely unaltered, indicating that between- but not within-sequence actions rely on the DLS. Conclusions: Skilled action sequencing, including 'chunk' transitions was dependent on DLS and its modulation by D2 receptors, but not on DMS function. Using a novel sequencing task, these results support the dissociable and dopamine-dependent role of the dorsal striatum subregions in performing skilled motor actions.",

    "content": "Mutations in the human neurexin 1 (NRXN1) gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. Vertebrate NRXN1 produces three major NRXN1 isoforms, named , {beta}, and {gamma}. Human genetic data suggests that deletions located at the 5' region of the gene disrupting the  isoform associate mostly with clinical behavioral deficits. Yet, 3' deletions that disrupt multiple isoforms have also been identified in clinical cases. Whether deletions that selectively affect specific NRXN1 isoforms result in specific behavioral deficits remains unclear. Here, we show that zebrafish harboring gene deletions that differentially encompass nrxn1a-, -{beta}, and/or -{gamma} display both unique and overlapping locomotion, sensorimotor behavior, and social behavior deficits. Combined, our results strongly support a model by which domain selective nrxn1 deletions predict behavioral phenotypes. Moreover, our results demonstrate compelling relationships between genotype and resulting behavioral phenotypes, providing functional insights into the complexity of NRXN1-associated neuropsychiatric behaviors.",

    "title": "Serial Dependence operates on categorical rather than physical representations: evidence from behavior and EEG",
    "content": "Our environment is constantly changing but our perception is stable. This stability may result from the integration of successive visual images that smooths over spurious variations in input. Such a process manifests in a behavioral phenomenon called Serial Dependence (SD), an attractive bias between successive stimuli. Here we questioned whether SD originates from physical stimulus representations or at a higher level, that of categorical perception. We constructed face morphs from three prototypes of the same face expressing anger, fear and sadness. We measured the perceived similarity between each pair of morphs with an odd-one-out experiment, to build a behavioral representational similarity matrix. Emotional expressions were perceived categorically. Subjects then reproduced the perceived facial expression of successively presented morphs by adjusting a response cue while their cerebral activity was recorded with EEG. We showed attractive serial dependence tuned to perceptual distance rather than physical similarity. We used representational similarity analysis to discover the geometry of the mental representation of faces, to capture both the information represented in a neural signal and its format. EEG representational similarity analyses showed that neural responses encoded emotional ambiguity rather than category membership, with near-prototypical faces eliciting similar patterns across emotions. Models combining feature tuning with categorical structure best accounted for behavioral biases. Neural signals also carried traces of past stimuli. Stimuli for which memory-based representations diverged most from sensory representations showed the strongest attractive serial dependence.",

    "title": "On collective behavior in C. elegans",
    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "content": "Extracting features from abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia patients\u2019 brain images holds significant importance for aiding diagnosis. However, existing methods remained limited in simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal information. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from dynamic systems, making it suitable for time-series signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). This study utilized resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy subjects and 68 schizophrenia patients. The DMD method was employed to extract the mean amplitude of dynamic patterns as features, with feature selection conducted via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. A support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to validate the predictive capability of the selected features across subject groups. Based on the LASSO screening, we identified brain regions exhibiting significant inter-group differences in mean amplitude, designated these as abnormal regions, and subsequently analyzed their functional deviations. The DMD method not only provided explicit temporal dynamic representations of brain activity but also supported signal reconstruction and prediction, thereby enhancing feature interpretability. Results demonstrated that DMD effectively extracted mean amplitude features from fMRI data. Combined with LASSO and SVM, it enabled the identification of abnormal brain regions and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, this method captured frequency-dependent signal patterns, with extracted features correlating with both regional activation intensity and functional connectivity. This approach provides novel insights for exploring potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "The recently developed phenomenological renormalization group (pRG) analysis has uncovered scale-free properties in large-scale neural population recordings across recording modalities, including extracellular electrophysiology and calcium imaging. The convergence of these properties across the datasets hints at universal neural behavior. Yet, it is unknown how differences in temporal resolution and measurement details affect pRG scaling. Here, we use a network model known to produce scaling under pRG analysis as a testbed to assess how recording and analysis choices shape inferred scaling exponents. We show that scaling properties depend on the choices of temporal binning, measurement nonlinearities, and deconvolution, and that the quality of scaling for cluster covariance eigenvalues is particularly sensitive to measurement effects. Moreover, all scaling exponents shift substantially with these transformations, even when the underlying neural dynamics are identical. Together, these results show how experimental choices can change pRG scaling and provide a framework for separating scaling driven by neural dynamics from that introduced by the recording method.",

Recent in vivo recording of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neuronal activity during CFC-E paradigm showed that the time course of serotonin level includes both rapid responses to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli and a slowly accumulating component that spans inter-trial intervals and reverses during extinction. By reviewing the studies that directly link the fear expression during CFC-E to the acute or chronic perturbations of serotonin dynamics at the organism level or within specific brain areas via pharmacological, genetic, and projection-specific manipulations, we argue that theoretical models defining the causal role of serotonin must incorporate continuous-time serotonin dynamics.",

    "title": "Deep learning approaches for EEG-based healthcare applications: a comprehensive review",
    "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a longstanding means of non-invasively recording brain signals and has become highly valuable for the study of neurological and cognitive processes. Recent progress in deep learning has also greatly improved both EEG signal analysis and interpretation, making more accurate, reliable and scalable solutions in various healthcare applications. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the convergence of EEG and deep learning, with an emphasis on diagnostic of neurological disorders, brain recovery, mental health conditions, and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. We methodically investigate the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, transformer models and hybrid architectures for EEG-based tasks. Key challenges that have been hampering emerging solutions are critically covered, namely signal-related variability, the lack of data, and deep learning model limited interpretability. Finally, we highlight emerging trends, open issues and promising research directions, with the aim of laying a solid ground toward the improvement of EEG-based healthcare applications and to drive future research in this fast-growing research area.",

    "content": "IntroductionMaternal and child undernutrition are linked to atypical brain development in children. Provision of pre- and post-natal small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) has been shown to positively impact children\u2019s growth and development. It is unknown, however, whether SQ-LNS affects child brain morphology.MethodsThe present study used data from the International Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements randomized controlled trial in Ghana. Participants were 231 children (Mage = 10.6 years; 49.4% female) exposed to maternal iron and folic acid supplements prenatally (n = 113, control group) or maternal SQ-LNS prenatally until 6 mo postpartum and child SQ-LNS from age 6 to 18 months (n = 118, SQ-LNS group). Children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain anatomy. Primary outcomes were total gray matter volume, cortical gray matter thickness, and cortical gray matter volume assessed with whole-brain analyses. Secondary outcomes were thickness and volume of a priori specified cortical and subcortical regions assessed with region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. Basic and full covariate models were tested and corrected for multiple comparisons.ResultsWhole-brain analyses revealed no significant differences between groups in total gray matter volume or cortical gray matter thickness or volume. Cortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater right caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) thickness [mean (95%CI): 2.78 (2.73, 2.84) vs. 2.72 (2.67, 2.77); effect size = 0.21] and reduced left rostral ACC volume [2575.1 (2477.3, 2672.8) vs. 2678.74 (2568.7, 2788.8); effect size = 0.18]. Subcortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater volume of the left pallidus [1794.45 (1759.10, 1829.80) vs. 1726.13 (1685.05, 1767.21); effect size = 0.33] and right nucleus accumbens [751.54 (729.83, 773.24) vs. 705.73 (684.21, 727.24); effect size = 0.39]. Significant group differences did not hold after correction for multiple comparisons.DiscussionIn this cohort, pre- and post-natal SQ-LNS supplementation did not significantly alter total or cortical gray matter thickness and volume at 10 years, though secondary ROI analyses indicated subtle, non-robust differences in selected regions.",

    "content": "IntroductionAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder causing progressive motor neuron death in cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. The most common genetic cause is the G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the non-coding region of exon 1 of C9ORF72, accounting for ~40% of familial and ~7% of sporadic ALS. RNA dysregulation is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to ALS pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify specific microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in motor neuron degeneration in C9ORF72-ALS.MethodsWe profiled 754 miRNAs in human post-mortem spinal cord tissue from C9ORF72-ALS patients and healthy donors. Laser capture microdissection isolated ventral horn regions, and in silico target prediction identified potential genes and pathways regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs. Target genes were validated by Real time PCR.ResultsTwo subsets of miRNAs were exclusively expressed in ventral horn regions: miR-200b-3p and miR-346 in C9ORF72-ALS patients, and miR-30d-5p, miR-106b-5p and miR-135a-5p in healthy donors. Target prediction and molecular analysis identified putative genes and pathways linked to cell death, inflammation, protein metabolism, DNA modification, excitotoxicity, autophagy and vesicles trafficking.DiscussionThis study identifies specific miRNAs and their target genes as key molecules in motor neuron degeneration in C9ORF72-ALS. Restoring their expression could represent a therapeutic approach for ALS.",

    "title": "A narrative review of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) applications in hearing loss, tinnitus and vestibular disorders",
    "content": "IntroductionFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising neuroimaging modality for investigating cortical activity in auditory and vestibular domains. Its portability, device compatibility, and motion tolerance make it particularly suited for use in populations that are challenging to study with conventional neuroimaging techniques, such as infants and cochlear implant (CI) users. The present study aims to explore the potential and limitations of this neuroimaging technique in the audiological and vestibular fields, offering an integrated perspective across pediatric, adult and elderly populations.MethodsA narrative review of studies using fNIRS in hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibular disorders was conducted through searches in PubMed and Scopus up to March 2025. Studies were included if they employed fNIRS to investigate cortical responses in individuals with diagnosed hearing loss, chronic tinnitus or to investigate vestibular function.ResultsA total of 60 studies were reviewed: 36 on hearing loss, 11 on tinnitus, and 13 on vestibular disorders. In hearing research, fNIRS successfully identified cortical activation patterns related to auditory perception, speech processing, and cross-modal plasticity in CI users across development, adulthood and aging. The technique showed prognostic potential in predicting CI outcomes and monitoring listening effort and cognitive load. In tinnitus research, fNIRS consistently demonstrate hyper-activation in the auditory cortex and altered functional connectivity with frontal-limbic networks, reflecting sensory, cognitive, and emotional involvement. The technique was sensitive to treatment effects following interventions such as transcranial stimulation, acupuncture, and cochlear implantation. In vestibular research, fNIRS enabled the mapping of cortical networks involved in balance control and multisensory integration during various stimulation paradigms, including caloric testing, motion platforms, and optic flow in virtual environments. Although current applications are mostly exploratory, findings suggest fNIRS can capture vestibular-related cortical activity in real-world conditions.ConclusionfNIRS offers a valuable, non-invasive, and ecologically valid method for investigating auditory and vestibular function across the lifespan. In hearing and tinnitus research, it shows strong potential for clinical translation, especially if methodological standardization is achieved. Applications in vestibular research remain preliminary but promising.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This pilot study explored the potential link between KD-induced clinical improvements and gut microbiota alterations.MethodsWe engaged 27 PD patients in a 12-week ketogenic dietary trial (16 completed) and employed 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze gut microbiota differences compared to 27 healthy controls.ResultsBaseline analysis revealed distinct dysbiosis in PD patients, characterized by increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. Following the 12-week intervention, patients exhibited significant improvements in both motor (MDS-UPDRS Part III, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and non-motor symptoms (NMSS, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). These clinical improvements were accompanied by specific microbial shifts: a significant increase in Enterococcus and Synergistota, and a decrease in Alloprevotella.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the therapeutic effects of the ketogenic diet in PD are associated with specific remodeling of the gut microbiota, particularly the enrichment of potential beneficial taxa and reduction of pro-inflammatory genera.Clinical trial registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/index.html, Unique Identifier: ChiCTR2100045394.",

    "title": "Perceptual punctuation: fixational eye movements reveal segmentation of auditory streams",
    "content": "IntroductionPerception operates as rhythmically structured sampling in which temporal predictions determine when incoming signals are weighted. Fixational eye movements carry opposing consequences, enhancing acuity yet inducing brief peri-saccadic suppression, suggesting that their timing is paced by expected, salient rhythms. Auditory scenes can be parsed into competing streams that unfold over time. If fixation dynamics are shaped by temporal expectation, and auditory streaming imposes a percept-dependent temporal structure on otherwise identical acoustics, then fixational eye movements might provide a window into how listeners parse sound over time. We asked whether fixational eye movements reflect the perceived rather than the physical temporal organization of an ambiguous ABA\u2013 pattern.MethodsWhile listeners fixated and either attended High, Low, or All tones (Experiment 1, n = 15) or freely reported their percept (Experiment 2, n = 15), we recorded binocular eye position (500 Hz) and quantified microsaccade (MS) dynamics and eye-velocity spectra.ResultsAcross both experiments, eye-velocity spectra showed a percept-dependent redistribution between 2 and 4 Hz, with relative power shifting with the instructed/reported stream. A normalized 4\u20132 Hz index (\u0394PSD) separated Low-tone from High-tone percepts across procedures. Time-resolved analyses further revealed within-trial waxing-and-waning of 2 vs. 4 Hz dominance, consistent with bistable fluctuations in maintaining a stream. Moreover, microsaccade reaction time (msRT), aligned to the onset of the sound sequence, differed significantly depending on the percept.DiscussionThese findings extend oculomotor inhibition beyond discrete events, positioning fixation dynamics as a sensitive, report-free marker of auditory scene organization. We discuss mechanistic links to temporal attention and active sensing, and implications for a multisensory timing framework.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
    "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15437v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer potential support for autistic people, but this potential requires understanding the implicit perspectives these models might carry, including their biases and assumptions about autism. Moving beyond single-agent prompting, we utilized LLM-based multi-agent systems to investigate complex social scenarios involving autistic and non-autistic agents. In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism. We found that ChatGPT assumes autistic people are socially dependent, which may affect how it interacts with autistic users or conveys information about autism. To address these challenges, we propose adopting the double empathy problem, which reframes communication breakdowns as a mutual challenge. We describe how future LLMs could address the biases we observed and improve interactions involving autistic people by incorporating the double empathy problem into their design.",

In particular, mental health chatbots are emerging as a promising solution, but these remain largely untested, raising concerns about safety and potential harms. In this paper, we dive into the literature to identify critical gaps in the design and implementation of mental health chatbots. We contribute an operational checklist to help guide the development and design of more trustworthy, safe, and user-friendly chatbots. The checklist serves as both a developmental framework and an auditing tool to ensure ethical and effective chatbot design. We discuss how this checklist is a step towards supporting more responsible design practices and supporting new standards for sociotechnically sound digital mental health tools.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15385v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Natural-language-to-visualization (NL2VIS) systems based on large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved the accessibility of data visualization. However, their further adoption is hindered by two coupled challenges: (i) the absence of standardized evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess progress in the field and compare different approaches; and (ii) natural language descriptions are inherently underspecified, so multiple visualizations may be valid for the same query. To address these issues, we introduce VegaChat, a framework for generating, validating, and assessing declarative visualizations from natural language.\n  We propose two complementary metrics: Spec Score, a deterministic metric that measures specification-level similarity without invoking an LLM, and Vision Score, a library-agnostic, image-based metric that leverages a multimodal LLM to assess chart similarity and prompt compliance.\n  We evaluate VegaChat on the NLV Corpus and on the annotated subset of ChartLLM. VegaChat achieves near-zero rates of invalid or empty visualizations, while Spec Score and Vision Score exhibit strong correlation with human judgments (Pearson 0.65 and 0.71, respectively), indicating that the proposed metrics support consistent, cross-library comparison.\n  The code and evaluation artifacts are available at https://zenodo.org/records/17062309.",

However, widespread XR adoption remains limited due to two key challenges: 1) the high cost and complexity of authoring 3D content, especially for large-scale environments or complex interactions; and 2) the steep learning curve associated with non-intuitive interaction methods like handheld controllers or scripted gestures. Generative AI (GenAI) presents a promising solution by enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction and automating content generation. Leveraging vision-language models and diffusion-based generation, GenAI can interpret ambiguous instructions, understand physical scenes, and generate or manipulate 3D content, significantly lowering barriers to XR adoption. This paper explores the integration of XR and GenAI through three concrete use cases, showing how they address key obstacles in scalability and natural interaction, and identifying technical challenges that must be resolved to enable broader adoption.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Interactive narrative (IN) authors craft spaces of divergent narrative possibilities for players to explore, with the player's input determining which narrative possibilities they actually experience. Generative AI can enable new forms of IN by improvisationally expanding on pre-authored content in response to open-ended player input. However, this extrapolation risks widening the gap between author-envisioned and player-experienced stories, potentially limiting the strength of plot progression and the communication of the author's narrative intent. To bridge the gap, we introduce Elsewise: an authoring tool for AI-based INs that implements a novel Bundled Storyline concept to enhance author's perception and understanding of the narrative possibility space, allowing authors to explore similarities and differences between possible playthroughs of their IN in terms of open-ended, user-configurable narrative dimensions. A user study (n=12) shows that our approach improves author anticipation of player-experienced narrative, leading to more effective control and exploration of the narrative possibility spaces.",

Informal texts hide dependencies, while formal systems expose every detail in ways that are not always human-readable. Dependency graphs offer a middle ground by making visible the structure of results, definitions, and proofs. We present KnowTeX, a standalone, user-friendly tool that extends the ideas of Lean's Blueprints, enabling the visualization of conceptual dependencies directly from LaTeX sources. Using a simple \"uses\" command, KnowTeX extracts relationships among statements and generates previewable graphs in DOT and TikZ formats. Applied to mathematical texts, such graphs clarify core results, support education and formalization, and provide a resource for aligning informal and formal mathematical representations. We argue that dependency graphs should become a standard feature of mathematical writing, benefiting both human readers and automated systems.",

This study empirically explores how disabled students perceive robot-based support, comparing two interaction roles, one information based (signposting) and one disclosure based (sounding board), and two embodiment types (physical robot/disembodied voice agent). Participants assessed these systems across five dimensions: perceived understanding, social energy demands, information access/clarity, task difficulty, and data privacy concerns. The main findings of the study reveal that the physical robot was perceived as more understanding than the voice-only agent, with embodiment significantly shaping perceptions of sociability, animacy, and privacy. We also analyse differences between disability types. These results provide critical insights into the potential of social robots to mitigate accessibility barriers in higher education, while highlighting ethical, social and technical challenges.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15292v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Diabetes is a significant and continuously rising health challenge in Indonesia. Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-based health applications have been developed for early detection, most function as \"black boxes,\" lacking transparency in their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer a solution, yet their technical outputs are often incomprehensible to non-expert users. This research aims to develop a mobile application front-end that presents XAI-driven diabetes risk analysis in an intuitive, understandable format. Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The resulting prototype interprets SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a key XAI approach, into accessible graphical visualizations and narratives. Evaluation through user comprehension testing (Likert scale and interviews) and technical functionality testing confirmed the research objectives were met. The combination of visualization and textual narrative effectively enhanced user understanding (average score 4.31/5) and empowered preventive action, supported by a 100% technical testing success rate.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15291v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Independent navigation is a core aspect of maintaining social participation and individual health for vulnerable populations. While historic cities such as Edinburgh, as the capital of Scotland, often feature well-established public transport systems, urban accessibility challenges remain and are exacerbated by a complex landscape, especially for groups with multiple vulnerabilities such as the blind elderly. With limited research examining how real-time data feeds and developments in artificial intelligence can enhance navigation aids, we address this gap through a mixed-methods approach. Our work combines statistical and machine learning techniques, with a focus on spatial analysis to investigate network coverage, service patterns, and density through live Transport for Edinburgh data, with a qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with the mentioned target group. The results demonstrate the highly centralised nature of the city's transport system, the significance of memory-based navigation, and the lack of travel information in usable formats. We also find that participants already use navigation technology to varying degrees and express a willingness to adopt artificial intelligence. Our analysis highlights the importance of dynamic tools in terms of sensory and cognitive needs to meaningfully improve independent travel.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15290v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Testing conversational AI systems at scale across diverse domains necessitates realistic and diverse user interactions capturing a wide array of behavioral patterns. We present a novel multi-agent framework for realistic, explainable human user simulation in interactive scenarios, using persona control and task state tracking to mirror human cognitive processes during goal-oriented conversations. Our system employs three specialized AI agents: (1) a User Agent to orchestrate the overall interaction, (2) a State Tracking Agent to maintain structured task state, and (3) a Message Attributes Generation Agent that controls conversational attributes based on task progress and assigned persona. To validate our approach, we implement and evaluate the framework for guest ordering at a restaurant with scenarios rich in task complexity, behavioral diversity, and conversational ambiguity. Through systematic ablations, we evaluate the contributory efficacy of each agentic component to overall simulation quality in terms of persona adherence, task completion accuracy, explainability, and realism. Our experiments demonstrate that the complete multi-agent system achieves superior simulation quality compared to single-LLM baselines, with significant gains across all evaluation metrics. This framework establishes a powerful environment for orchestrating agents to simulate human users with cognitive plausibility, decomposing the simulation into specialized sub-agents that reflect distinct aspects of human thought processes applicable across interactive domains.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15530v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined as an abnormal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on protein biomarkers via PET or CSF analysis. However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15689v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Volitional memory control supports adaptive cognition by enabling intentional Recall of goal-relevant information and Suppression of unwanted memories. While neural mechanisms underlying Recall and Suppression have been studied largely in isolation, less is known about the large-scale brain networks supporting these processes under competing cognitive demands, particularly as a function of subclinical anxiety. Here, we examined control of emotionally valenced memories during directed Recall and Suppression while 47 participants concurrently performed an independent visual working memory task. Cognitive control efficiency was quantified using the Balanced Integration Score (BIS), and seed-to-voxel resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) was used to characterize intrinsic network organization. Dissociable rsFC profiles were associated with memory control efficiency across emotional valences and were selectively moderated by anxiety. More efficient Suppression of positive memories was linked to reduced connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and posterior perceptual-midline regions, as well as diminished hippocampal-frontal pole coupling. In contrast, efficient Suppression of negative memories was associated with increased connectivity between posterior parietal and lateral occipital regions. Anxiety moderated relationships between cognitive efficiency and prefrontal connectivity during Suppression of positive memories and Recall of positive and neutral memories. Direct comparisons further revealed stronger hippocampal-thalamic rsFC during Suppression relative to Recall of positive memories. Together, these findings delineate the functional brain architecture supporting volitional control of emotional memories under cognitive load and demonstrate that anxiety severity selectively shapes these network-level mechanisms across the anxiety continuum.",

The resulting theory captures order-one transients, fixed points, and noise-induced shifts of bifurcation structure, and outperforms standard linearization-based approximations in the strong-fluctuation regime. More broadly, the approach applies whenever dynamics depend smoothly on OU processes via nonlinear transformations, offering a tractable route to noise-dependent phase diagrams in computational neuroscience models.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15344v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Precision psychiatry aspires to elucidate brain-based biomarkers of psychopathology to bolster disease risk assessment and treatment development. To this end, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has helped triangulate brain circuits whose functional features are correlated with or even predictive of forms of psychopathology. Yet, fMRI biomarkers to date remain largely descriptive identifiers of where, rather than how, neurobiology is aberrant, limiting their utility for guiding treatment. We present a method for decomposing fMRI-based functional connectivity (FC) into constituent biomechanisms - output drive, input responsivity, modulator gating - with clearer alignment to differentiable therapeutic interventions. Neurocircuit mechanism decomposition (NMD) integrates (i) a graph-constrained, lag-aware transformer to estimate directed, pathway-specific routing distributions and drive signals, with (ii) a measurement-aware state-space model (SSM) that models hemodynamic convolution and recovers intrinsic latent dynamics. This dual-head architecture yields interpretable circuit parameters that may provide a more direct bridge from fMRI to treatment strategy selection. We instantiate the model in an anatomically and electrophysiologically well-defined circuit: the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.",

    "title": "Learning Discrete Successor Transitions in Continuous Attractor Networks: Emergence, Limits, and Topological Constraints",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.15336v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are a well-established class of models for representing low-dimensional continuous variables such as head direction, spatial position, and phase. In canonical spatial domains, transitions along the attractor manifold are driven by continuous displacement signals, such as angular velocity-provided by sensorimotor systems external to the CAN itself. When such signals are not explicitly provided as dedicated displacement inputs, it remains unclear whether attractor-based circuits can reliably acquire recurrent dynamics that support stable state transitions, or whether alternative predictive strategies dominate.\n  In this work, we present an experimental framework for training CANs to perform successor-like transitions between stable attractor states in the absence of externally provided displacement signals. We compare two recurrent topologies, a circular ring and a folded snake manifold, and systematically vary the temporal regime under which stability is evaluated. We find that, under short evaluation windows, networks consistently converge to impulse-driven associative solutions that achieve high apparent accuracy yet lack persistent attractor dynamics. Only when stability is explicitly enforced over extended free-run periods do genuine attractor-based transition dynamics emerge. This suggests that shortcut solutions are the default outcome of local learning in recurrent networks, while attractor dynamics represent a constrained regime rather than a generic result.\n  Furthermore, we demonstrate that topology strictly limits the capacity for learned transitions. While the continuous ring topology achieves perfect stability over long horizons, the folded snake topology hits a geometric limit characterized by failure at manifold discontinuities, which neither curriculum learning nor basal ganglia-inspired gating can fully overcome.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15319v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Adult neurodivergence, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome (CDS), is marked by substantial symptom overlap that limits the discriminant sensitivity of standard psychometric instruments. While recent work suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate human psychometric responses from qualitative data, it remains unclear whether they can accurately and stably model neurodevelopmental traits rather than broad personality characteristics. This study examines whether LLMs can generate psychometric responses that approximate those of real individuals when grounded in a structured qualitative interview, and whether such simulations are sensitive to variations in trait intensity. Twenty-six adults completed a 29-item open-ended interview and four standardized self-report measures (ASRS, BAARS-IV, AQ, RAADS-R). Two LLMs (GPT-4o and Qwen3-235B-A22B) were prompted to infer an individual psychological profile from interview content and then respond to each questionnaire in-role. Accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity were assessed using group-level comparisons, error metrics, exact-match scoring, and a randomized baseline. Both models outperformed random responses across instruments, with GPT-4o showing higher accuracy and reproducibility. Simulated responses closely matched human data for ASRS, BAARS-IV, and RAADS-R, while the AQ revealed subscale-specific limitations, particularly in Attention to Detail. Overall, the findings indicate that interview-grounded LLMs can produce coherent and above-chance simulations of neurodevelopmental traits, supporting their potential use as synthetic participants in early-stage psychometric research, while highlighting clear domain-specific constraints.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15314v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent high-precision experimental confirmations of quantum complementarity have revitalized foundational debates about measurement, description, and realism. This article argues that complementarity is most productively interpreted as an epistemic principle--constraining what can be simultaneously accessed and represented--rather than as an ontological claim about quantum reality. Reexamining the Einstein-Bohr debate through this lens reveals a persistent tension between descriptive completeness and contextual meaning, a tension experiments clarify but do not dissolve. Building on this analysis, we introduce cognitive complementarity as a structural principle governing reasoning under non-classical uncertainty, where mutually constraining representations cannot be jointly optimized. Within this framework, we propose quantum intuition as a testable cognitive capacity: the ability to sustain representational plurality, regulate commitment timing, and resolve perspective-incompatibilities in a context-sensitive manner. Formulated as a naturalistic construct grounded in shared informational constraints, quantum intuition offers a principled bridge between quantum measurement theory and cognition. This work reframes the historical debate, extends epistemic lessons from quantum foundations into cognitive science, and outlines empirical pathways for studying decision-making in contexts of irreducible uncertainty.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.15313v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The brain solves a problem that current AI architectures struggle to manage: storing specific episodic facts without corrupting general semantic knowledge. Neuroscience explains this through Complementary Learning Systems theory - a fast hippocampal system for episodic storage using pattern-separated representations, and a slow neocortical system for extracting statistical regularities. Current AI systems lack this separation, attempting both functions through neural weights alone. We identify the 'Stability Gap' in online neural memory: fast-weight mechanisms that write facts into shared continuous parameters collapse to near-random accuracy within tens of semantically related facts. Through semantic density (rho), we show collapse occurs with as few as N=5 facts at high density (rho > 0.6) or N ~ 20-75 at moderate density - a phenomenon we formalise as the Orthogonality Constraint. This failure persists even with perfect attention and unlimited context, arising from write-time interference when storage and retrieval share the same substrate. We also identify schema drift and version ambiguity as primary failure modes in production systems, observing 40-70% schema consistency and 0-100% clean correction rates. Context-based memory incurs 30-300% cost premium over selective retrieval. We propose Knowledge Objects (KOs): discrete, typed memory units with controlled vocabularies and explicit version chains. Paired with neural weights, KOs enable a true complementary learning architecture, suggesting reliable AI memory may require this bicameral design.",

    "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

    "title": "The impact of dynamic reversal potential on the evolution of action potential attributes during spike trains",
    "content": "Action potentials (AP) are the basic elements of information processing in the nervous system. Understanding AP generation mechanisms is a critical step to understand how neurons encode information. However, an individual neuron might fire APs with various shapes even in response to the same stimulus, and the mechanisms responsible for this variability remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed four AP attributes including AP rapidity and threshold during consecutive bursts from three neuron types using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. In response to consecutive current steps, the AP attributes in evoked spike trains show two distinctive patterns across different neurons: (1) The first APs from each train always have comparable properties regardless of the stimulus strength; (2) The attributes of the subsequent APs during each pulse monotonically change during the burst, where the magnitude of AP attribute change during each pulse increases with increasing stimulation strength. Various conductance-based models were explored to determine if they replicated the observed AP bursts. The observed patterns could not be replicated using the classical HH-type models, or modified HH model with cooperative Na+ gating. However, adding ion concentration dynamics to the model reproduced the AP attribute variation, and the magnitude of change during a pulse correlated with change in dynamic reversal potential (DRP), but failed to replicate the first AP attributes pattern. Then, the role of cooperative Na+ gating on neuronal firing dynamics was investigated. Inclusion of cooperative gating restored the first APs\u2019 attributes and enhanced the magnitude of modeled variation of some AP attributes to better agree with observed data. We conclude that changes in local ion concentrations could be responsible for the monotonic change in APs attributes during neuronal bursts, and cooperative gating of Na+ channels can enhance the effect. Thus, the two mechanisms could contribute to the observed variability in neuronal response.",

However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

However, the limited number of MI-EEG samples per subject and the susceptibility of features to noise and artifacts posed significant challenges for achieving high decoding performance. To address this problem, a Data-Augmented Multi-Scale Temporal Attention Convolutional Network (AMANet) was proposed. The network mainly consisted of four modules. First, the data augmentation module comprises three steps: sliding-window segmentation to increase sample size, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) extraction of discriminative spatial features, and linear scaling to enhance network robustness. Then, multi-scale temporal convolution was incorporated to dynamically extract temporal and spatial features. Subsequently, the ECA attention mechanism was integrated to realize the adaptive adjustment of the weights of different channels. Finally, depthwise separable convolution was utilized to fully integrate and classify the deep extraction of temporal and spatial features. In 10-fold cross-validation, the results show that AMANet achieves classification accuracies of 84.06 and 85.09% on the BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b, respectively, significantly outperforming baseline models such as Incep-EEGNet. On the High-Gamma dataset, AMANet attains a classification accuracy of 95.48%. These results demonstrate the excellent performance of AMANet in motor imagery decoding tasks.",

    "title": "Methodological optimization for eliciting robust median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials for realtime single trial applications",
    "content": "Objective. Single-trial measurement of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting its use in real-time neurorehabilitation applications. We describe and evaluate methodological optimizations for eliciting reliable median nerve SEPs measurable in real time, with reduced reliance on post-processing. Methods. In twelve healthy participants, two sessions each, SEPs were assessed at three pulse widths (0.1, 0.5, 1 ms), at a low-frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz \u00b1 10%), and at an intensity sufficient to evoke consistent and robust sensory nerve action potentials and compound muscle action potentials. The evoked potential operant conditioning system platform was used to monitor responses in real time. Feasibility was also evaluated in a participant with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Results. SEP P50 and N70 were reliably elicited in healthy participants, and in individual with iSCI, across all tested pulse widths with minimal discomfort. N70 amplitude increased significantly with pulse width ( = 17.64, p = 0.0001, w = 0.80), while P50 amplitude remained unchanged. SNR showed a significant pulse width-dependent increase ( = 7.82, p = 0.02, w = 0.35) with improvements of 40% and 52% at 0.5 and 1 ms, respectively. N70 single-trial separability significantly improved at 1 ms (AUC of 0.83, = 8.17, p= 0.017), including the iSCI participant (0.84\u2013less impaired hand, 0.79\u2013more impaired hand). Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70\u20130.84, p < 0.05) was highest at 0.5 ms, indicating more consistent N70 and P50 measurements across sessions at a longer pulse width. Significance. Robust median nerve SEPs can be measured at single trials with methodological optimizations such as a longer pulse width (0.5\u20131 ms), low frequency (0.5 Hz), a consistent afferent excitation guided by nerve and muscle responses, and a robust EEG acquisition system. This setup can be useful for real time SEP-based brain computer interface applications for rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Objective: This article aimed to examine the psychometric properties of a measure of youth fear-avoidance of concussive symptoms. Method: Fear-avoidance is thought to be a risk factor for prolonged concussion recovery; however, current measures of fear-avoidance focus on pain rather than broader symptoms. We adapted the Fear of Pain Questionnaire to be relevant to concussion symptoms with a new version called the Fear of Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire (FOCSQ). We assessed the psychometrics of this scale with a sample of <em>N</em> = 115 youth with persistent postconcussive symptoms (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 15.1 years, 58% female, 70% non-Hispanic White, 15% Hispanic, <em>M</em> = 79.2 days since injury), including reliability, construct validity, and cross-informant reliability. Results: Exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor model was a good fit for youth report (fear and avoidance) and a three-factor model for parent proxy (fear, school/social avoidance, and movement avoidance). Reliability was excellent, with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for both youth report and parent proxy of 0.93 (95% CI [0.91, 0.95]). Construct validity indicated moderate correlation between youth-report FOCSQ and concussive symptoms 0.55 (95% CI [0.41, 0.66]), headache severity 0.37 (95% CI [0.19, 0.53]), depression 0.62 (95% CI [0.49, 0.72]), and anxiety 0.64 (95% CI [0.51, 0.73]). Criterion-related validity was supported by an inverse correlation between FOCSQ and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory: \u22120.64 (95% CI [\u22120.74, \u22120.52]). Youth report and parent proxy were moderately correlated, with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient <em>r</em> = 0.60 (95% CI [0.47, 0.71]). Conclusions: The FOCSQ is a reliable and valid measure of fear-avoidance in youth with concussion, and future research might explore whether this measure could be used to identify youth at risk for prolonged recovery.

    "title": "Phonological networks remain intact in multiple sclerosis.",
    "content": "Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition characterized by white and gray matter decline that leads to slower motor function and cognitive impairment. Although language remains relatively intact, individuals with MS often have word retrieval difficulties. Previous research suggests that these difficulties may be related to vocabulary, the number of words an individual knows, and other semantic aspects of language. However, few studies have examined phonological aspects of speech. Method: We examined speech in 89 individuals with MS and 88 age-matched neurotypical adults using a phonemic verbal fluency task. We took a network science approach, building a phonological network from participants\u2019 responses and their close phonological neighbors. We then examined the local network characteristics (degree, clustering coefficient) of participants\u2019 responses to assess whether responses differed between the groups. Results: Although individuals with MS produced fewer responses during the task, the network characteristics of their responses were similar to neurotypical adults, the control group. Moreover, lexical characteristics such as word length and lexical frequency were also similar between groups (model <em>R</em>\u00b2 values < 1%). Finally, a forward flow analysis, which quantifies the phonological similarity between adjacent responses and provides a metric of how people search phonemic space, did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that phonological aspects of speech remain stable in individuals with MS. Word retrieval difficulties in MS may arise from neurological changes in semantic processes, in combination with other cognitive abilities such as speed of processing and executive function, which are common in MS.

    "content": "Objective: Moral cognition has been insufficiently studied in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). This study investigated moral decision making and judgment using ecologically valid moral dilemmas in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive MS phenotypes, exploring associations with clinical and psychological variables. Method: Twenty-one individuals with relapsing-remitting MS and 21 with progressive MS completed a battery of moral dilemmas (instrumental, incidental, and ecological) and questionnaires assessing quality of life, mood, alexithymia, and empathy. Data from pwMS were compared to those of 56 age- and education-matched healthy controls. Group differences were analyzed using Mann\u2013Whitney U tests, and effect sizes (<em>r</em>) were reported. Results: Compared to healthy controls, pwMS showed significantly higher moral acceptability in instrumental (<em>U</em> = 633.0, <em>p</em> = .001, <em>r</em> = 0.39), incidental (<em>U</em> = 745.5, <em>p</em> = .035, <em>r</em> = 0.23), and ecological dilemmas (<em>U</em> = 563.0, <em>p</em>< .001, \n<em>r</em> = 0.44). Moral permissiveness was positively correlated with disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale: \u03c1 = 0.36, <em>p</em> = .019) and negatively with physical quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life\u2013Physical: \u03c1 = \u22120.33, <em>p</em> = .034) and inhibitory control (Stroop Test: \u03c1 = 0.47, <em>p</em> = .002). Empathy scores were inversely correlated with moral acceptability across all dilemmas (<em>p</em> < .05). Conclusions: PwMS exhibit increased moral permissiveness, particularly in relation to clinical disability, physical functioning, and executive control. These findings contribute to characterizing the sociocognitive profile of MS and support the inclusion of moral cognition in future research, though implications for patient care remain preliminary.

    "content": "Objective: Literature concerning the structural brain correlates of verbal memory in aging with multiple sclerosis (MS) is scarce. This study addressed this gap by examining the impact of white matter microstructure and macrostructure on verbal memory in older adults with and without MS. Method: Participants were 64 older adults with MS (OAMS; age <em>M</em> [<em>SD</em>] = 64.19 [3.82]) and 72 controls (age <em>M</em> [<em>SD</em>] = 69.78 [6.99]). Verbal memory was measured using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test\u2013Revised (HVLT-R), and white matter fractional anisotropy and lesion volume were extracted from diffusion tensor and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery magnetic resonance imaging. Statistical models examined whether white matter measures moderated the association between the presence of MS and HVLT-R performance. Results: Adjusted moderation models revealed that OAMS showed lower HVLT-R total immediate recall compared to controls in the presence of higher lesion volume in the bilateral fornices, left uncinate fasciculus, and right ventral cingulum, and lower HVLT-R delayed recall in the presence of lower fractional anisotropy in the right ventral cingulum and higher lesion volume in the left uncinate fasciculus and right ventral cingulum, with small effect sizes (interaction term \u0394<em>R</em>\u00b2s = .03\u2013.06,<em> p</em>s < .05). Conclusions: Recall was lower in OAMS when limbic tract white matter had lower integrity and higher lesion load. Findings suggest that the influence of MS on verbal memory in older adults is related, in part, to underlying white matter disruptions in tracts implicated in memory. While the sample was generally representative of the U.S. MS population (majority White women), generalizability is limited and warrants further research.

    "title": "EEG dynamics in Lewy body diseases is related to clinical fluctuations and degeneration of locus coeruleus",
    "content": "This work investigates aperiodic bursts of neuronal activity, referred to as neuronal avalanches, which are thought to support flexible information processing in Lewy body (LB) disease. We compared avalanche-derived features across LB disease phenotypes (prodromal dementia with LB and Parkinson's disease, PD), with healthy controls (HC). Based on the premise that focal neurodegeneration alters whole-brain dynamics, we examined whether the \"richness\" of brain dynamics was associated with clinical symptoms and with the microstructural integrity of catecholaminergic nuclei - the right caudal locus coeruleus (rcLC) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The sample comprised 30 HC, 56 cognitively normal individuals with core clinical features of dementia with LB (CN-CCF), 34 individuals with mild cognitive impairment with LB (MCI-LB), and 30 advanced PD patients. Neuronal avalanches were extracted from source-reconstructed resting-state EEG and described by their count, the number of unique spatial patterns (flexibility), hemispheric symmetry of flexibility, and avalanche transition matrices. LC and SNpc integrity were assessed using neuromelanin-sensitive MRI and free-water diffusion imaging, respectively. Lewy body disease groups exhibited increased flexibility relative to HC, which was, in prodromal groups, associated with cognitive fluctuations and REM sleep behavior disorder symptoms, but not parkinsonism. Flexibility was negatively related to rcLC integrity, which was lowest in MCI-LB. These findings suggest that elevated flexibility reflects dysregulated brain dynamics linked to malignant non-motor features of LB diseases and to the caudal LC involvement.",

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "Objective: Previous research suggested that Recognition Memory Test\u2013Words (RMT-W) scores may be confounded by gender and handedness. This study was designed to examine its classification accuracy as a performance validity test (PVT) and susceptibility to demographic characteristics. Method: Archival data were collected from a consecutive sequence of 310 diagnostically heterogeneous examinees (181 men; <em>M</em><sub>Age</sub> = 41.4; <em>M</em><sub>Education</sub> = 12.9). The RMT-W\u2019s classification accuracy was computed against psychometrically operationalized criterion groups. Results: Optimal RMT-W cutoffs (\u2264 42 to \u2264 40) produced a good combination of sensitivity (.62\u2013.70) and specificity (.90\u2013.96), correctly classifying 85.6%\u201387.7% of the sample. Women scored 1.5 points higher. RMT-W scores were unrelated to handedness but were correlated with education. A linear relationship emerged between level of education and the cutoff needed to achieve \u2265 .90 specificity: \u2264 43 for \u2265 13 years of education, \u2264 41 for 12 years of education, and \u2264 39 for \u2264 11 years of education. RMT-W \u2264 45 had .91 specificity in women with postsecondary education. Conclusions: Results suggest that overall, the RMT-W remains an effective free-standing PVT. Gender, age, and handedness in isolation had minimal impact on RMT-W scores. However, education had a clinically significant effect. The combined effect of gender and education produced a marked shift in classification accuracy. Systematic research is needed on the relationship between demographics and PVT outcomes to ensure that cutoffs have the same clinical interpretation regardless of patient variables.

    "title": "Exploring the link between National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery performance and everyday functioning in mild cognitive impairment.",
    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychologists routinely use scores on traditional paper-and-pencil tests to assess capacity for independent functioning, with these assessments accounting for a moderate amount (20%\u201337%) of the variance in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) performance. The field is shifting toward incorporation of computerized neuropsychological assessments such as the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB). There have been no studies examining how the NIHTB-CB relates to IADL performance or whether it better predicts IADL performance compared to traditional methods. Method: Data from 74 participants in the Lithium as a Treatment to Prevent Impairment of Cognition in Elders were analyzed. Participants completed a neuropsychological assessment battery, the NIHTB-CB, and measures of IADL capacity. Linear regression was used to determine whether NIHTB-CB performance predicted IADL performance. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to determine whether NIHTB-CB added incremental validity to the prediction of IADL performance. Results: Select NIHTB-CB measures predicted IADL functioning as measured by a performance-based assessment of everyday functioning, but not self- or informant-reported everyday functioning. Of these subtests, two were found to add incremental validity to the prediction of IADL performance above and beyond their matched traditional measures, with effect sizes ranging from mild to moderate (<em>F</em>\u0394<em>R</em>\u00b2 = .045\u2013.077). Conclusions: We found performance on individual NIHTB-CB subtests predicted approximately the same amount of variance in IADL functioning as traditional tests, with only subtests assessing processing speed and executive functioning adding a mild to moderate amount of additional variance above matched measures. It remains important for clinicians to consider additional determinants of functioning when using computerized assessments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Familial longevity, educational attainment, and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities are independently protective for cognitive aging, yet little is known about how these factors relate with one another. We explored the interplay between familial longevity, life exposures that confer cognitive resilience, and cognitive function in the Long Life Family Study. Method: A series of Bayesian hierarchical regression models was used to examine the associations among familial longevity, educational attainment, participation in cognitively stimulating activities, and neuropsychological test performance in several cognitive domains in an ancillary observational study of Long Life Family Study family members and a referent cohort (<em>N</em> = 314, <em>M</em> = 75.7, <em>SD</em> = 14.6 years). Models were adjusted by age, sex, and upstream variables along the regression pathway (i.e., cognitive activity, education, and familial longevity), and incorporated a random intercept for family relatedness. Results: Referents had greater engagement in cognitive activities, and in turn, those with higher levels of education and cognitive activity exhibited better neuropsychological performance. Greater cognitive activity was specifically associated with better executive functioning, episodic memory, and language scores. Although Long Life Family Study family members engaged in cognitive activities less often than referents, they performed better on tests of episodic memory, and matched performance on tests of executive function, language, and visuoconstruction. Conclusions: These results suggest that familial longevity and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities represent two distinct pathways that contribute to preserved cognition in older adulthood, though these findings should be replicated in more diverse samples. Furthermore, these unique pathways differ across tests and cognitive domains. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Remote assessment of episodic memory would be a cost-effective alternative to in-person visits for early detection of memory impairment related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), but there is a need for test development and studies in population-based samples. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity and correlates of a novel three-trial administration of 10-word list learning included in the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status in a population-based study of 65- to 96-year-old individuals. Method: A total of 800 participants completed telephone-administered word list learning task that yielded immediate and delayed recall measures. We compared these to corresponding measures from in-person neuropsychological assessment and tested differences between cognitively normal individuals and those with cognitive impairment or neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, we studied the associations of age, sex, education, and genetic risk of AD with telephone-administered memory measures. Results: Telephone-administered three-trial word list learning task yielded normally distributed immediate and delayed recall measures that performed like corresponding measures from in-person assessment. Having cognitive impairment or AD\u2014but not genetic risk of AD\u2014were related to poorer memory performance. Younger age, being female, and having secondary education were related to better memory performance. Conclusion: Our study supports the validity of telephone-administered word list task with multiple learning trials. Remote assessment of memory can be used as an alternative to inviting people to in-person assessment and is also easily accessible for people living in remote areas and for those with physical disabilities or during restrictions related to in-person contact.

    "content": "Microscale biophysical alterations in neuronal dynamics can have profound implications for macroscale pathological outcomes in the brain. Despite the critical need to link neuronal perturbations to large-scale disease manifestations, few studies successfully bridge these hierarchical scales. Here, we bridge microscale biophysical variability within neuronal dynamics to macroscale disease-related phenotypes. We find that Drosophila models expressing tauopathy- and epilepsy-associated molecular mutations exhibit increased dynamic instability in the timing of action potential initiation. We show that the microscale biophysical origin of this instability is enhanced variability in voltage-gated sodium channel currents during non-stationary channel inactivation. We also find that treatment with antiepileptic drugs stabilizes neuronal dynamics by modulating this variability in voltage-gated sodium channel currents. Finally, we show that neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy exhibit analogous dynamic instability, which is reversible by administration of antiepileptic medications. Our results highlight how subtle microscale neuronal instabilities propagate and are amplified to produce macroscopic pathological phenotypes, providing new biophysical insights into neurological disorders and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention.",

The present study sought to understand how informant-rated everyday cognitive abilities related to memory, language, spatial skills, planning, organization, and divided attention\u2014as measured by the Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale\u2014change over time in a diverse sample of older adults. Method: Participants (<em>N</em> = 891) from the University of California Davis Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center longitudinal cohort (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 76.1, <em>SD</em><sub>age</sub> = 7.4) were followed for an average of 4.4 years with annual ECog assessments. Multilevel beta regression was used to model ECog scores as a function of time, cognitive domain, diagnosis change, and\u2014in a neuroimaging subsample (<em>N</em> = 264)\u2014cross-sectional and longitudinal total gray matter and hippocampus volume. Results: ECog domains changed at different rates when modeled as a function of diagnosis change; differences in domain were most apparent in the stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-MCI and MCI-to-dementia conversion groups. By contrast, ECog domains changed at the same rate when modeled as a function of baseline gray matter volume and longitudinal gray matter volume change, corresponding to other research suggesting that cognitive domains change at relatively uniform rates over time. In separate models, total gray matter and hippocampus atrophy were salient predictors of ECog score changes. At baseline, hippocampus volume was the strongest predictor of ECog intercepts. Conclusions: Although some caution is warranted interpreting score changes due to floor and ceiling effects, the ECog appears sensitive to underlying gray matter atrophy and change in clinical disease severity when used longitudinally.

Whats our purpose? <em>Whats the point?</em></p>\n<p>For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth.</p>\n<p>As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress.</p>\n<p>I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings. However I believe its important that we each learn to <em><strong>harness that energy into things that are positive and kind</strong></em>, not negative or evil.</p>\n<p>Remember that a lot of who you are, is your ability to experience things outside of yourself, <em>including other humans.</em> They are a direct and immediate part of your own reality. Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved. As frustrating as the world can be, it is worth protecting, it is worth loving, it is worth healing together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish...

Think of all the power that's in the universe, moving the earth, growing the trees. That's the same power within you if you only have the courage and the will to use it.&quot;</em> - Charlie Chaplin, Limelight 1952</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone.&quot;</em> - Isa Upanishad</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "title": "Perspectives of Global Standards on Validation of Blood Pressure Measuring Devices",
    "content": "Blood pressure (BP) measuring devices are essential tools across all areas of medicine, where BP is used as a vital sign for assessing cardiovascular status, guiding clinical decisions in acute medicine, critical care, and routine monitoring of hospitalized patients. International standards for BP measuring devices establish safety and accuracy criteria to ensure the reliability and usability of these instruments. The standardization of BP device validation protocols is vital to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of readings, which are crucial for effective medical decision-making. However, with the rapid advancements in the field of novel cuffless continuous or intermittent blood pressure monitoring devices, traditional validation standards for cuff-based devices are not applicable to cuffless systems. To address this, various organizations have established specific standards tailored for cuffless continuous blood pressure monitoring devices. Nevertheless, only 67 out of over 3,800 studies on the cuffless continuous BP devices (<2%) adopted the appropriate validation criteria, thereby compromising the accuracy and reliability of their reported results. This work presents a comparative analysis of validation protocols for BP measuring devices and provides guidance on the appropriate standards for different types of BP monitors, aims to highlight areas where standards might be strengthened or harmonized. The findings of this research are intended to contribute to the ongoing efforts to establish globally recognized, scientifically rigorous guidelines for the validation of BP measuring devices, fostering innovation and technological advances in this field over time.",

    "title": "Confidence-Driven Deep Learning Framework for Early Detection of Knee Osteoarthritis",
    "content": "Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that severely impacts mobility and quality of life, particularly among older adults. Its diagnosis often relies on subjective assessments using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, leading to variability in clinical evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a confidence-driven deep learning framework for early KOA detection, focusing on distinguishing KL-0 and KL-2 stages. The Siamese-based framework integrates a novel multi-level feature extraction architecture with a hybrid loss strategy. Specifically, multi-level Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers are employed to extract features from varying network depths, ensuring comprehensive feature representation, while the hybrid loss strategy partitions training samples into high-, medium-, and low-confidence subsets. Tailored loss functions are applied to improve model robustness and effectively handle uncertainty in annotations. Experimental results on the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, comparable to those of expert radiologists. Cohen's kappa values ($\\kappa$ $>$ 0.85)) confirm substantial agreement, while McNemar's test ($p$ $>$ 0.05) indicates no statistically significant differences between the model and radiologists. Additionally, Confidence distribution analysis reveals that the model emulates radiologists' decision-making patterns. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach to serve as an auxiliary diagnostic tool, enhancing early KOA detection and reducing clinical workload.",

    "content": "Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) have emerged as a groundbreaking neural technology for restoring motor function and enabling direct neural communication pathways. Despite their therapeutic potential in neurological rehabilitation, the critical challenge of neural decoder calibration persists, particularly in the context of transfer learning. Traditional calibration approaches assume the availability of extensive neural recordings, which is often impractical in clinical settings due to patient fatigue and neural signal variability. Furthermore, the inherent constraints of implanted neural processors\u2014including limited computational capacity and power consumption requirements\u2014demand streamlined processing algorithms. To address these clinical and technical challenges, we developed DMM-WcycleGAN (Dimensionality Reduction Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning based Wasserstein Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks), a novel neural decoding framework that integrates meta-learning principles with optimal transfer learning strategies. This innovative approach enables efficient decoder calibration using minimal neural data while implementing dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize computational efficiency in implanted devices. In vivo experiments with non-human primates demonstrated DMM-WcycleGAN's superior performance in mitigating neural signal distribution shifts between historical and current recordings, achieving a 3% enhancement in neural decoding accuracy using only ten calibration trials while reducing the calibration duration by over 70%, thus significantly improving the clinical viability of iBMI systems.",

    "title": "An Active Spring Mass Model With Biomimetic Ground Reaction Forces for Multiple Terrains",
    "content": "Common activities of daily living naturally blend walking on level ground, stairs, and slopes. Predicting human locomotion behavior across these environments is critical for control design in lower-limb assistive devices. One approach to achieving this goal is to use feedforward simulation of conceptual gait models that capture the whole body dynamics of human locomotion. So far, however, these models have mainly been developed to predict human walking and running dynamics on level ground. Objective: To develop a conceptual gait model that can walk on level ground as well as negotiate stairs and ramps of different inclinations (up to $\\pm 42^\\circ$) while producing biomimetic ground reaction forces (GRFs). Methods: We extended the passive bipedal spring mass model by incorporating active elements, introducing seven control parameters. These parameters were then tuned to match the human GRFs for stairs. Results: By optimizing these control parameters, we found that the resultant model's GRF correlates strongly with human data with median Pearson correlation coefficients $R_{x}>0.89$ and $R_{y}>0.96$ for stair walking. Furthermore, we observe its predictive capabilities are not limited to stairs, as it can also mimic the GRFs of human slope walking. Finally, we conducted a parameter analysis to assess how model parameters affect GRFs and identified a reduced, five parameter model that can reproduce human GRFs with a fidelity similar to the seven parameter model. Significance: The model may help to predict human locomotion behavior in more complex terrain, for instance, when planning foot placements in the interactive control of powered lower-limb exoskeletons and prostheses.",

    "title": "A Multimodal Ultrasound-Driven Approach for Automated Tumor Assessment With B-Mode and Multi-Frequency Harmonic Motion Images",
    "content": "Objective: Harmonic Motion Imaging (HMI) is an ultrasound elasticity imaging method that measures the mechanical properties of tissue using amplitude-modulated acoustic radiation force (AM-ARF). Multi-frequency HMI (MF-HMI) excites tissue at various AM frequencies simultaneously, allowing for image optimization without prior knowledge of inclusion size and stiffness. However, challenges remain in size estimation as inconsistent boundary effects result in different perceived sizes across AM frequencies. Herein, we developed an automated assessment method for tumor and focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) induced lesions using a transformer-based multi-modality neural network, HMINet, and further automated neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) response prediction. HMINet was trained on 380 pairs of MF-HMI and B-mode images of phantoms and in vivo orthotopic breast cancer mice (4T1). Test datasets included phantoms (n = 32), in vivo 4T1 mice (n = 24), breast cancer patients (n = 20), FUS-induced lesions in ex vivo animal tissue and in vivo clinical settings with real-time inference, with average segmentation accuracy (Dice) of 0.91, 0.83, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. HMINet outperformed state-of-the-art models; we also demonstrated the enhanced robustness of the multi-modality strategy over B-mode-only, both quantitatively through Dice scores and in terms of interpretation using saliency analysis. The contribution of AM frequency based on the number of salient pixels showed that the most significant AM frequencies are 800 and 200 Hz across clinical cases. Significance: We developed an automated, multimodality ultrasound-based tumor and FUS lesion assessment method, which facilitates the clinical translation of stiffness-based breast cancer treatment response prediction and real-time image-guided FUS therapy.",

    "content": "Are there individuals who resist episodic memory decline into older age? Analyzing 728,000 memory tests from 80,000 participants with at least 4 assessments, we introduce a simulation-calibrated framework to identify genuine memory stability. Across cohorts and models, ~10% of adults [&ge;]70 years showed stable performance over a decade. In an MRI subgroup (n{approx}2,000), stable performers exhibited lower rates of brain atrophy across widespread regions, anchoring cognitive stability in structural brain maintenance. However, stability was often transient rather than trait-like: many individuals followed trajectories with extended plateaus of stable performance punctuated by episodes of accelerated decline. Accordingly, 54% showed at least one period of observed stability, averaging 10 years, whereas only 0.4% upheld stable performance over 24 years under the strictest definition. These findings are consistent with a complex-systems model of cognitive aging in which decline often reflects critical transitions rather than continuous erosion.",

    "title": "Opposite Effects of Alpha Oscillations on Mind-Wandering With Eyes Open and Closed",
    "content": "Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity underlie mind-wandering, when mental experience sometimes becomes unrelated to what we are currently doing. Mind-wandering research has investigated ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha frequency band (7-14 Hz), thought to reflect changes in arousal and attention. However, studies disagree whether alpha power increases or decreases while mind-wandering compared to focused attention. We hypothesized that these opposite effects arise from differences in eye state across studies, as eye closure increases alpha power and can reverse its relationship to sleepiness, which is itself related to mind-wandering. To test this, we recorded EEG while male and female participants with eyes either open or closed were probed to report whether they were focused on the auditory attention task or mind-wandering, as well as how sleepy they were. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that increased alpha power made both mind-wandering and sleepiness reports more likely in the eyes-open group but less likely in the eyes-closed group. A systematic review of past literature largely replicated these opposite relationships across eye states in different paradigms. We propose that these results reflect an inverted-U relationship between alpha power and mind-wandering, formed by a positive relationship at low alpha power values typical of eyes-open states and a negative relationship at high alpha power values typical of eyes-closed states. By sampling alpha power across eye states in the same paradigm, this work reconciles contradictions in prior literature and clarifies how ongoing neural oscillations reflect the stream of mental experiences.",

    "content": "Tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau filaments, with disease-specific folds revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we delivered a recombinant human tau carrying the P301L/S320F double mutation into AppNL-G-F/MAPT double knock-in mice using a blood-brain-barrier-permeable AAV (AAV-PHP.eB), enabling rapid induction of tau aggregation in vivo. The mutant tau was systemically administered via retro-orbital injection, providing a minimally invasive approach for widespread neuronal transduction. Phosphorylated tau aggregation, as well as seeding activity, were observed without the need for exogenous seeds. Our cryo-EM analysis resolved a novel filament fold incorporating residues 279-329, in which the P301L and S320F mutations introduced stabilizing interactions that reinforced filament assembly. This conformation was distinct from previously reported folds, including Alzheimer and Pick tau filaments. Moreover, the filaments adopted a more compact architecture than those observed in patient-derived samples or other model mice. This finding demonstrates that P301L/S320F double-mutant tau adopts a structurally unique, highly aggregation-prone fold, and that this system provides a rapid platform for modeling tau filament formation.",

    "title": "Time-frequency embedding with contrastive pre-training allows sub-second seizure detection",
    "content": "Rapid and accurate detection of electrographic seizures is critical for both clinical diagnosis and neuroscience research. Although seizure identification is commonly performed in the time domain, analysis in the time-frequency domain provides a more comprehensive representation of seizure characteristics. In this study, we present a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that incorporates a trainable continuous wavelet transform (CWT) layer, enabling adaptive time-frequency feature learning directly from raw EEG. To address common data challenges, we augment the 3D CNN for pre-training with contrastive learning, comparing contrastive predictive coding (CPC) against bidirectional contrastive learning (BiCL). On single-channel and multi-channel data, the standard 3D CNN outperformed both a 2D CNN with pre-computed CWT and a 1D CNN that processes raw signals, achieving >95% accuracy down to 0.5-second segments. Compared to the standard 3D CNN, the 3D CNN with BiCL pre-training showed superior performance in both low-data and class imbalance scenarios. Further experiments involving band-pass filtering and temporal shuffling revealed that classification is driven primarily by low-frequency patterns and statistical features rather than temporal dependencies. The proposed framework also maintained >90% accuracy with moderate noise and downsampling applied to inputs, as well as when cross-subject generalization was evaluated using held-out subjects. We show that a 3D CNN with a trainable CWT layer and BiCL pre-training enables accurate sub-second seizure detection and effectively mitigates data limitations common in clinical settings. This work demonstrates that time-frequency embedding within CNNs, augmented by self-supervised pre-training, offers a promising path toward architectures for sub-second seizure detection in the presence of practical limitations of real-world scenarios.",

    "title": "Reduced GABAB receptor activation and post activation depression of proprioceptive afferents after spinal cord injury.",
    "content": "Despite a long history of studying presynaptic inhibition of the Ia afferent synapse that produces the monosynaptic EPSP on motoneurons, recent evidence has upset the conventional idea that GABAA receptors mediate this inhibition and instead suggests that there are mainly GABAB receptors at this synapse. However, without targeted access to the GABAergic neurons that activate these receptors, quantifying their functional contribution to presynaptic inhibition has proven difficult. We demonstrate here that focal optogenetic activation of terminals of a subpopulation of GAD2+ GABAergic neurons that exclusively project ventrally to Ia afferent synapses produce long-lasting presynaptic inhibition that is entirely mediated by GABAB receptors and simultaneously produces a characteristic brief GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP on the motoneurons. These ventral GAD2 neurons are recurrently activated by Ia afferents, contributing to post-activation depression with repeated afferent reflex testing, with a similar long time-course to post-activation depression of the H-reflex induced in humans from either repetitive activation of the same Ia afferents or from antagonist nerve conditioning. In contrast, focal activation of dorsally projecting GAD2 neurons does not directly cause presynaptic inhibition or postsynaptic IPSPs but does produce primary afferent depolarization. Following chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), the expression of GABAB receptors on the Ia terminal is halved, and in mice and humans, is associated with a similar decrease of GABAB receptor-mediated post-activation depression of Ia-EPSPs transmission, which is reversed by the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen. In summary, GABAB receptors mediate presynaptic inhibition, but are down regulated with SCI, contributing to reflex hyperexcitability associated with spasticity.",

    "title": "Microstate Dynamics of Focused Attention Meditation",
    "content": "Focused-attention meditation provides a tractable model for examining how large-scale brain dynamics support attention and self-regulation. Using high-density EEG microstate analysis, we investigated how focused-attention meditation on the breath (Anapanasati) modulates intrinsic brain activity in 22 experienced practitioners, compared with baseline rest and deliberate mental imagery. Five canonical microstate classes (A-E) were identified. Meditation produced a robust reduction of Microstate C across coverage, duration, and occurrence, accompanied by increased presence of Microstates D and E (all Microstate x Condition interactions p < 0.0001). Source localization revealed that Microstate C was generated primarily in medial and lateral temporal regions including the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, whereas Microstate D involved posterior midline regions including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and Microstate E engaged frontoparietal and orbitolimbic networks. Together, these results indicate that focused-attention meditation reorganizes the temporal architecture of large-scale brain dynamics by downregulating microstate patterns associated with self-referential and memory-based processing while enhancing neural states supporting attentional stability and internal monitoring.",

    "title": "Structural Brain Indicators of Cognitive Performance in Middle and Late Adulthood: The Human Connectome Project in Aging/Aging Adult Brain Connectome Cohort",
    "content": "Introduction: Significant effort has been put towards mapping patterns of atrophy in the cerebral cortex that are related to pathological aging, including the characteristic patterns of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast, brain structural patterns that support preserved or even exceptional cognition throughout the adult age-span and especially in later life are much less known. It is possible that superior cognitive performance in late life is supported by a preservation of brain structures vulnerable to typical aging. Alternatively, elevated performance could be related to preservation of brain regions vulnerable to age-associated pathology. Examination of individuals that exhibit superior cognition throughout the adult lifespan may provide unique insights into neural mechanisms that support cognitive resilience in late life. Methods: We examined cross-sectional associations between cortical brain structure and cognitive performance across three stages of adulthood: midlife (36-59), young-old (60-79), and older adults (80+) in typically aging individuals enrolled as part of the Human Connectome Project Lifespan-Aging (HCP-A)/Aging Adult Brain Connectome (AABC) studies. Participants were considered generally healthy and excluded for significant and/or atypical health conditions for their demographic category, including a clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment or dementia. Domain-specific cognitive factor scores representing memory, fluid intelligence, and crystalized intelligence were sex-stratified and residualized relative to age, and participants were classified as high, middle, or low performers based on their unique performance relative to the study sample. Results: In the full sample, high performers demonstrated greater cortical thickness in regions of somatomotor, visual, and auditory cortices, as well as cortical areas in the frontal, parietal, and insular cortices (e.g., 5m, LIPv, MBelt). We also found associations between medial temporal and cingulate cortical thickness and cognitive performance, but only for select analyses. Group differences in cortical thickness were greatest when contrasting high and low performers for fluid intelligence compared to the other cognitive factors and were most prominent in the midlife participants compared to the other age strata. These group differences were primarily driven by reduced cortical thickness in the low performing individuals in the younger age bins relative to the 'typically' performing sample. Effects were rather limited when contrasting high and low performers in the 80+ age group. The cortical areas of high statistical significance appeared to show a cross-sectional convergence effect, such that the differences in cortical thickness between high vs. low cognitive performance groups diminished with increasing age. Despite lower statistical power, effect sizes were greatest when contrasting individuals at the extremes of performance (e.g., top 10% vs. bottom 10% performers). These effects were robust to subsample replications using longitudinally defined cognitive classifications. Discussion: Elevated cognitive performance was cross-sectionally associated with increased regional cortical thickness and effects were most prominent in mid-life compared to later ages. Notably, contrary to brain regions that may be expected to support such high-order cognitive performance, a significant portion of primary sensory, motor, and insular cortical areas exhibited group differences between the high- and low-performing groups in this relatively younger age group. Group differences were due to lower thickness in these regions in the low performing group relative to the typical performers. In contrast to the younger portion of the sample, regions typically considered vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (i.e., regions in the medial temporal lobe) were only infrequently implicated. These results suggest that specific patterns of cortical brain structural integrity including preserved thickness of primary motor and sensory cortical regions may be a necessary but not sufficient mechanism supporting superior cognitive abilities in earlier adulthood, while alternate neural mechanisms may support cognitive resilience later in life. These results must be interpreted with caution given the cross-sectional nature of this study. Cognitive capacity can only be estimated from a single timepoint, and several factors contribute to inter-individual variation that will not be accounted for in the models applied here.

    "title": "Clonazepam activates the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) ion channel",
    "content": "Benzodiazepines represent a major class of drugs prescribed as treatments for anxiety, insomnia and seizures. They act by engaging GABAA receptors in the central nervous system to depress neuronal excitability. Here, the polypharmacology of benzodiazepines was explored by studying their engagement of human TRP channels revealing clonazepam acts as a robust and selective activator of the TRPM8 ion channel. Clonazepam-evoked Ca2+ signals were observed in cells expressing human TRPM8 channels, and in mouse trigeminal neurons. These responses were completely blocked by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of TRPM8 function. This discovery likely explains why clonazepam is an effective treatment for the painful oral condition known as burning mouth disorder, where local activation of TRPM8 channels in sensory neurons mitigates the painful symptoms of this disease.",

    "title": "A HISTORY OF ADOLESCENT OXYCODONE SELF-ADMINISTRATION: NEURAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS",
    "content": "Maturation of the prefrontal cortex and higher-order cognitive processes is ongoing through adolescence and young adulthood; developmental periods associated with the nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Initiation of oxycodone (OXY) self-administration during adolescence induces long-term dose-dependent impairments in neurobehavioral and neurocognitive development. To date, however, the neural mechanisms underlying neurocognitive impairments induced by adolescent prescription opioid use disorder (APOUD) have not been systematically evaluated. A DiOlistic labeling technique, in concert with sophisticated neuronal reconstruction software, revealed a prominent sex- and dose-dependent population shift in the morphological parameters of dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of rodents with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration relative to their control counterparts. Similarly, the biochemical mechanisms underlying dendritic spine dysmorphology, which were investigated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, were dependent upon biological sex. In male rodents, a dose-dependent decrease in mRNA expression of GRIN1, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, was observed in animals with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration relative to controls. In contrast, female rats with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration exhibited increased mRNA expression of cdk5, a protein kinase involved in the regulation of pre- and post-synaptic function; a transcriptional alteration that may result from excessive glutamate accumulation. Fundamentally, transcriptional dysregulation and dendritic spine dysmorphology mechanistically underlie, at least partly, APOUD-induced neurocognitive impairments. Collectively, results support that sex-dependent glutamatergic dysregulation may underlie dendritic spine dysmorphology in the ACC resulting in APOUD-induced neurocognitive impairments. Glutamatergic dysregulation, therefore, may afford a key target for the development of novel therapeutics.",

    "title": "Signal space beamforming for gain- and geometry-independent interference suppression in wearable MEG",
    "content": "Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) for wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer substantial flexibility compared to cryogenic MEG, but they also introduce new challenges related to environmental noise and movement artefacts. State-of-the-art denoising techniques such as signal space separation require not only dense OPM arrays but also the fine calibration of sensor gain and geometry. This may complicate their use in complex experimental situations involving uncooperative patients or subjects such as newborns or fetuses, where OPM positioning may be unstable or plain unknown. To address this limitation, we introduce signal space beamforming (SSB), a version of beamforming applied to sensor signals and designed to suppress interferences independently of sensor gain and geometry. We show that SSB operates via a trade-off between noise suppression and neural signal preservation that is controlled by a single soft-threshold parameter, which we calibrated using phantom measurements. We then validated the effectiveness of SSB across several datasets. Using interictal OPM-MEG recordings in epileptic patients, SSB successfully cleaned signals while preserving epileptiform discharges. Moving onto cutting-edge early neurodevelopmental OPM-MEG recordings, SSB allowed to recover auditory evoked responses in newborns and fetuses similar to previous findings but with more streamlined preprocessing and higher response amplitude in the case of the fetal data. We contend that SSB provides a pragmatic solution to exploit OPM-MEG data recorded in challenging conditions where geometry-dependent methods cannot be used, opening new frontiers for pioneering clinical and fundamental applications of the OPM technology.",

    "content": "Rendering affective touch through haptic interfaces has gathered significant interest due to its ability to elicit emotional responses. Among various forms of affective touch, this study focuses on stroke stimuli. An illusory stroke stimulus is rendered using eight discrete Pneumatic Unit Cell (PUC) actuators on the left forearm. The study systematically investigates how rendering parameters\u2014including the traveling speed of the illusory stroke, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive indentations, and indentation pressure\u2014affect the perceived pleasantness and continuity of the stimulus. Results reveal that higher speeds significantly improved both pleasantness and continuity, with speed emerging as the most influential factor. In contrast, SOA has no significant effect on either perceived pleasantness or continuity. Indentation pressure shows a moderate impact on pleasantness, with high pressures reducing pleasantness but having no significant effect on continuity. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between perceived pleasantness and continuity, underscoring the relevance of the continuity illusion created by sequential indentations with discrete actuators in evoking pleasant sensations. These findings demonstrate the potential of PUC actuators for creating affective touch stimuli and provide preliminary insights into the influence of rendering parameters on affective touch in human-machine and human-robot interactions.",

    "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

    "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
    "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

    "content": "Early neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease emerge before cognitive decline, yet their synaptic basis remains poorly defined. Here we identify an early, cell-type-specific disruption of synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens during pre-plaque stages of disease. In APP/PS1 mice, intracellular amyloid-beta accumulation is associated with a selective loss of mGluR1/5-dependent long-term depression in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons, despite comparable intracellular amyloid-beta levels across neuronal subtypes. This impairment is accompanied by aberrant postsynaptic remodeling characterized by functional accumulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors and increased excitatory drive. These synaptic alterations coincide with reduced dopamine-dependent signaling and selective changes in reward-related behavior, including altered hedonic consumption. Together, these findings identify an early vulnerability of the mesolimbic reward system and suggest that non-cognitive manifestations of Alzheimer's disease arise from circuit-level imbalance before plaque deposition.",

    "title": "Eye movements reveal the intuitive understanding of materials and their behavior",
    "content": "Does a metal ball sink or float when dropped into water? Answering this intuitively simple question relies on our understanding of materials and their physics. Knowing materials helps us to recognize objects, estimate their properties, and predict how they will behave when interacting with other objects or materials. This leads to expectations about material behaviors already in young infants, for example, that a metal ball should sink in water. Typically, properties and affordances of materials have been studied with perceptual tasks. But even though explicit perceptual judgments allow us to identify important determinants of material understanding, it is not clear how they relate to dynamic predictions of material behavior - which we need for successful interactions with objects. Here, we tap into material understanding by leveraging anticipatory eye movements, which have been shown to be direct readouts of trajectory predictions and can also reflect expectations about material properties such as elasticity or mass. This allows us to reveal the temporal evolution of dynamic predictions based on material properties. Furthermore, by using novel stimuli that violate intuitive expectations about material behavior, we demonstrate that even though dynamic predictions can be learned over time, there remains a fundamental difference between predictions in line with and against our intuitive expectations.",

    "title": "Ventral pallidal perineuronal nets regulate opioid relapse",
    "content": "Opioid use disorder remains a major health challenge worldwide. Neuronal activity in the ventral pallidum (VP) regulates opioid reward and relapse to opioid seeking but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. A sizable population of VP neurons previously linked to drug relapse expresses the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (VPPV). Across the brain parvalbumin neurons are often ensheathed by perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular structures that regulate intrinsic activity and constrain synaptic plasticity onto these neurons. The VP contains high levels of PNNs but the role of these structures in the neurophysiology of VPPV neurons and in relapse to opioid seeking has not been studied. To investigate whether VP PNNs are altered by opioid exposure, male and female mice were trained to self-administer intravenous heroin. We found that heroin increased the density of PNNs in the VP, and that an intracranial microinfusion of the PNN-degrading enzyme, chondroitinase ABC, prevented cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. VP PNN depletion also reduced the intrinsic excitability of VPPV neurons, potentiated inhibitory synaptic inputs onto these cells, and diminished Fos expression in VPPV neurons following reinstatement. The suppressive effect of VP PNN depletion on heroin seeking was rescued by chemogenetic activation of VPPV neurons and mimicked by chemogenetic VPPV neuron inhibition. Taken together, our results identify VPPV neurons and their associated PNNs as critical drivers of opioid seeking. Given the key role of PNNs in regulating neural plasticity and memory processes, targeting PNNs in the VP could provide a useful novel therapeutic avenue for treating persistent craving and relapse in opioid use disorder.",

    "title": "Reinforced Hippocampus-Accumbens pathway marks a shift towards cognitive decline in aging",
    "content": "Aging triggers early functional alterations in brain circuits that precede cognitive impairment, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Spatial navigation and memory, among the earliest affected, depend on hippocampus and downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which integrates spatial and motivational information to guide goal directed behaviors. Here we identify age-related, sex-dependent changes of the dorsal hippocampus - NAc (dHPC - NAc) pathway. Combining optogenetics with electrophysiology, chemogenetics, and behavioral analyses in mice, we show that aging shifts excitation - inhibition balance in dorsal CA1 toward pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability, strengthening hippocampal outputs. This selectively enhances synaptic drive onto D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons and involves a previously unrecognized long-range parvalbumin-expressing glutamatergic projection. Reducing dHPC-NAc excitability improves memory in aged mice. In humans, fMRI reveals heightened posterior hippocampal activity and stronger pHPC-NAc coupling during navigation. Together, we uncover a targetable pathway acting in an intervention-sensitive window of aging to correct negative cognitive trajectories.",

In this paper, we detail the design and evaluation of three wearable prototypes (Vibration, Skin Drag, and Tapping) capable of administering discrete (individual, separate pulses and stimuli). and continuous (overlapping or uninterrupted stimuli) forms of linear haptic cycles with inspiration from slow, deep guided breathing. Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

    "title": "Haptics of Pulse Palpation: Simulation and Validation Through Novel Sensor-Actuator System",
    "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

    "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
    "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

    "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
    "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

    "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

    "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

    "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

    "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

    "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

    "title": "Launch HN: Constellation Space (YC W26) \u2013 AI for satellite mission assurance",
    "content": "<p>Hi HN! We're Kamran, Raaid, Laith, and Omeed from Constellation Space (<a href=\"https://constellation-io.com/\">https://constellation-io.com/</a>). We built an AI system that predicts satellite link failures before they happen. Here's a video walkthrough: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=069V9fADAtM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=069V9fADAtM</a>.<p>Between us, we've spent years working on satellite operations at SpaceX, Blue Origin, and NASA. At SpaceX, we managed constellation health for Starlink. At Blue, we worked on next-gen test infra for New Glenn. At NASA, we dealt with deep space communications. The same problem kept coming up: by the time you notice a link is degrading, you've often already lost data.<p>The core issue is that satellite RF links are affected by dozens of interacting variables. A satellite passes overhead, and you need to predict whether the link will hold for the next few minutes. That depends on: the orbital geometry (elevation angle changes constantly), tropospheric attenuation (humidity affects signal loss via ITU-R P.676), rain fade (calculated via ITU-R P.618 - rain rates in mm/hr translate directly to dB of loss at Ka-band and above), ionospheric scintillation (we track the KP index from magnetometer networks), and network congestion on top of all that.<p>The traditional approach is reactive. Operators watch dashboards, and when SNR drops below a threshold, they manually reroute traffic or switch to a backup link. With 10,000 satellites in orbit today and 70,000+ projected by 2030, this doesn't scale.\nOur system ingests telemetry at around 100,000 messages per second from satellites, ground stations, weather radar, IoT humidity sensors, and space weather monitors. We run physics-based models in real-time - the full link budget equations, ITU atmospheric standards, orbital propagation - to compute what should be happening. Then we layer ML models on top, trained on billions of data points from actual multi-orbit operations.<p>The ML piece is where it gets interesting. We use federated learning because constellation operators (understandably) don't want to share raw telemetry. Each constellation trains local models on their own data, and we aggregate only the high-level patterns. This gives us transfer learning across different orbit types and frequency bands - learnings from LEO Ka-band links help optimize MEO or GEO operations.\nWe can predict most link failures 3-5 minutes out with >90% accuracy, which gives enough time to reroute traffic before data loss. The system is fully containerized (Docker/Kubernetes) and deploys on-premise for air-gapped environments, on GovCloud (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government), or standard commercial clouds.<p>Right now we're testing with defense and commercial partners. The dashboard shows real-time link health, forecasts at 60/180/300 seconds out, and root cause analysis (is this rain fade? satellite setting below horizon? congestion?). We expose everything via API - telemetry ingestion, predictions, topology snapshots, even an LLM chat endpoint for natural language troubleshooting.<p>The hard parts we're still working on: prediction accuracy degrades for longer time horizons (beyond 5 minutes gets dicey), we need more labeled failure data for rare edge cases, and the federated learning setup requires careful orchestration across different operators' security boundaries.\nWe'd love feedback from anyone who's worked on satellite ops, RF link modeling, or time-series prediction at scale. What are we missing? What would make this actually useful in a production NOC environment?<p>Happy to answer any technical questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46721933\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46721933</a></p>\n<p>Points: 26</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>",

    "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

    "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

    "content": "Haptic feedback is essential for precise motor control, making its integration into artificial limbs a critical design challenge. Current approaches to restoring lost tactile input in patients have focused on interfacing with somatosensory pathways at the brain, nerve, or skin level, achieving partial restoration. However, augmentative artificial limbs, devices that provide novel movement capabilities beyond the biological body, pose unique challenges. These limbs lack dedicated sensory pathways, raising fundamental questions about how to deliver tactile feedback for these devices without disrupting existing somatosensory function. A promising direction lies in exploiting intrinsic tactile feedback, which emerges naturally at the interface between wearable devices and the body. When an artificial limb moves or interacts with objects, the skin detects rich tactile cues transmitted through this interface. Amplifying and refining this intrinsic feedback, via materials optimized for transmission of tactile signals and wearable designs, could enable more intuitive and interpretable haptic feedback for augmentative limbs. This approach offers a pathway toward enhancing embodiment and motor control of augmentative artificial limbs.",

    "title": "Multi-modal and multi-region distance model for neuroimaging: Application to ABCD study",
    "content": "Large-scale neuroimaging studies often collect multiple modalities, such as task and resting-state functional MRI, diffusion MRI, and structural MRI. Joint inference across these modalities uses shared variation to improve statistical efficiency, increase replicability, and provide a more integrated view of brain-phenotype associations. In practice, however, such analyses are limited because complex cross-modality covariance cannot be flexibly modeled, which makes the resulting joint effects difficult to interpret. A recent distance-based ANOVA extension allows multimodal analysis and increases power for detecting group differences, but it cannot easily distinguish location from scale effects in distance space, offers only an omnibus pseudo-F test without interpretable parameters, and requires computationally intensive permutation inference. We propose a novel semiparametric, U-statistics-based Generalized Estimating Equation (UGEE) framework that unifies univariate and multivariate distance models. By regressing pairwise dissimilarities on covariates, this method yields interpretable regression coefficients that disentangle location and scale effects and quantify inter-modality differences, while flexibly accounting for correlations among modality distances. The estimator is based on efficient influence functions, ensuring asymptotic efficiency, robustness to misspecification, and computational scalability for large-scale data analysis. We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulations and analyses of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development dataset. Results show that UGEE accurately estimates modality, group, and interaction effects and achieves a 100-fold speed-up compared with permutation-based approaches. This framework provides a general and computationally efficient tool for semiparametric inference on multimodal data, particularly suited for large neuroimaging applications.",

We present PRISME (Power Resampling Infrastructure for Statistical Method Evaluation), a MATLAB toolbox for neuroimaging power benchmarking. PRISME provides a computational framework for empirical power analysis independent of inference methods, enabling large scale power benchmarking and method comparison.The toolbox supports diverse neuroimaging data types, including both voxel-based activation and functional connectivity analyses, with a non-parametric, flexible algorithm and unified data representations. Furthermore, unlike previous empirical power approaches, PRISME supports multiple test types, such as association and difference tests with behavioral and clinical measures. Finally, PRISME's $25times$ speedup from algorithmic optimizations enables larger-scale power benchmarking, including the first power analysis for the ABCD dataset. Overall, PRISME is the first method- and data-type-agnostic power benchmarking tool for neuroimaging, providing a single solution for power analysis across diverse study designs.",

    "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder lacking disease-modifying therapies, and its management is limited by the absence of accessible biomarkers for disease progression and treatment response. We implemented an ultra-deep plasma proteomics workflow integrating Mag-Net extracellular vesicle enrichment with Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometry to profile longitudinal samples from PD patients. This approach quantified 6,481 plasma proteins, an unprecedented depth in PD studies, revealing distinct signatures associated with disease duration and dopaminergic therapy exposure. Candidate biomarkers were validated in an independent cohort using ELISA, demonstrating predictive utility in AI-driven models. To uncover mechanistic drivers, we intersected proteomic data with our new genome-wide overexpression screens for regulators of alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibril uptake, identifying MFN2, PSMD4, and EIF4G1 as major hubs that link systemic proteomic changes to mitochondrial dynamics and proteostasis. Additionally, a meta-analysis of brain transcriptomes responsive to Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment identified 42 candidate genes, including NDUFS4, GNAS, TSC1, and NTS, some of which are targets of approved therapeutics. Finally, an integrative network analysis revealed that key pathological hubs, such as IFNG and PLAT, are targets of approved pharmacological agents. Overall, these findings provide a systems-level resource for PD biomarker discovery and reveal druggable pathways for precision medicine strategies aimed at improving therapeutic outcomes.",

    "title": "Dying oligodendrocytes persist without mitochondria",
    "content": "Myelin is an insulating, multi-layered membrane that supports axonal integrity and neural communication. Different stressors impair myelinating oligodendrocytes, leading to demyelination, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. The intracellular processes underlying oligodendrocyte degeneration and death are unclear. Here, using optically targeted DNA damage that causes single-cell demyelination, we reveal that injured mature oligodendrocytes lose mitochondria within days and persist without them for weeks to months before cell death. This differs from other oligodendrocyte lineage cells, which exhibit acute mitochondrial changes followed by rapid cell death. Conditional deletion of the mitochondrial-related gene, Fis1, in mature oligodendrocytes, similarly causes acute loss of mitochondria and prolonged cell death. The unique cell death is characterized by nuclear changes, intracellular stress, and markers of disease-associated oligodendrocytes. Thus, mitochondrial loss may be an early marker of oligodendrocyte pathology, and mitochondrial quality control is required for oligodendrocyte and myelin homeostasis.",

On January 16, Ollama added support for an Anthropic-compatible API, and I was curious how far this could be pushed in practice. I decided to try plugging local Ollama models directly into a Claude Code-style workflow and see if it would actually work end to end.<p>Here is the release note from Ollama that made this possible: <a href=\"https://ollama.com/blog/claude\">https://ollama.com/blog/claude</a><p>Technically, what I do is pretty straightforward:<p>- Detect which local models are available in Ollama.<p>- When internet access is unavailable, the client automatically switches to Ollama-backed local models instead of remote ones.<p>- From the user\u2019s perspective, it is the same Claude Code flow, just backed by local inference.<p>In practice, the best-performing model so far has been qwen3-coder:30b. I also tested glm-4.7-flash, which was released very recently, but it struggles with reliably following tool-calling instructions, so it is not usable for this workflow yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46722285\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46722285</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>",

    "title": "A Gata4-Loxl2 Axis Controls ECM Remodeling to Enable Scar-Free Spinal Cord Regeneration in Zebrafish",
    "content": "Spinal cord injury in mammals causes permanent loss of sensory and motor function due to scar formation obstructing axon regrowth. In contrast, zebrafish fully regenerate their spinal cord without lasting fibrosis. Here, we identify the transcription factor Gata4 as a key positive regulator of regeneration. After injury, gata4 expression is predominantly upregulated in ependymo-radial glial cells and in glial cells extending processes toward sites of tissue bridging. Gata4 preserves glial identity and orchestrates regenerative extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Gata4 loss biases glial cells toward a fibroblast-like state with upregulated Loxl2b, a collagen cross-linking enzyme, and can also increase Loxl2b in nearby non-glial cells. Excess Loxl2b activity promotes pathological crosslinking and formation of a rigid, fibrotic matrix impairing glial and axonal bridging across the lesion, greatly reducing motor recovery. Pharmacological inhibition of Loxl2b in gata4 mutants substantially rescues ECM organization, tissue bridging, and functional recovery. Injury-induced gata4 expression depends, at least in part, on Hif1 signaling and activation of a short injury responsive enhancer. We identify the Gata4 Loxl2b axis as a central regulator of and potential therapeutic target for scar-free spinal cord repair.",
