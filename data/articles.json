    "title": "Early heart disease prediction using LV-PSO and Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolution Neural Network on phonocardiogram signals",
    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

    "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "title": "Enhanced sensory perception and myoelectric control with high channel count implanted sensorimotor systems",
    "content": "Objective. Implanted electrodes for nerve stimulation and myoelectric recording facilitate bidirectional sensory feedback and control for neuromuscular conditions such as limb loss. While increasing implanted electrode channel count offers potential benefits, it also presents engineering and implementation challenges. This case study examines how increasing implanted electrode channel count affects sensory perception and myoelectric controller performance, thereby supporting the value of these advancements. Approach. One participant with upper extremity transradial limb loss received a percutaneous implanted system with two 8-channel extraneural cuff electrodes on the median and ulnar nerves, totaling 16 stimulating channels. The individual later received a wirelessly connected implanted system featuring four 16-channel extraneural cuff electrodes on the median, ulnar, and radial nerves, totaling 64 stimulation channels, and four tetra-intramuscular (TIM) recording electrodes in residual muscles, totaling 32 sensing channels configured into 16 bipolar pairs. To compare sensory perception between the 16- and 64-channel stimulation systems, we assessed cumulative percept location coverage and the number of unique percept locations, estimated through hierarchical clustering. We compared performance across three myoelectric control algorithms that mapped 8, 10, or 14 intramuscular signal inputs through an artificial neural network to control a virtual hand in 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), with simultaneous, independent, and proportional control. Main results. Increasing stimulation channel count expanded cumulative percept location coverage and increased the number of unique percept locations on the hand. Adding intramuscular recording channel inputs improved 4-DOF myoelectric control of a virtual hand, increasing target posture match percentage and path efficiency. Significance. This case study demonstrates that increasing the number of implanted electrodes can advance sensory restoration and myoelectric control for bidirectional upper limb prostheses. Continued development of more complex systems with higher channel counts may further improve outcomes for individuals with limb loss and enhance the function of sensorimotor restoration systems.

    "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
    "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

    "title": "Extinction and reinstatement sex-dependently affect freezing behavior, pain perception, locomotion, and rearing behavior in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
    "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

    "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

    "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

    "content": "Environmental threats are typically encountered when animals are searching for food and other necessities. Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

    "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks).

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "content": "Caveolae are cell-surface signaling hubs involved in stem cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the molecular details of how they influence stem cell quiescence remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that most caveolae components, particularly caveolin-1 (Cav-1), are specifically upregulated in quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs). Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cav-1 restricts platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)  signaling, a key regulator for NSC proliferation and oligodendrocyte differentiation in the adult brain, through lysosomal degradation. Genetic ablation of Cav-1 leads to aberrant NSC activation, reduced neurogenesis, and enhanced ectopic oligodendrocyte differentiation on the ventricular surface in the ventral side of the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), a key NSC niche responsible for neuroblast differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that Cav-1 deficiency suppresses the endo-lysosomal degradation of PDGFR, leading to PDGFR accumulation and excessive signaling for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Taken together, our results uncover a crucial homeostatic mechanism wherein caveolae function as a safeguard to maintain adult NSC quiescence and lineage fidelity by controlling lysosomal turnover of PDGFR in a niche-specific manner.",

    "title": "Hippocampal cell- and circuit-specific differences in mitochondrial form and function",
    "content": "Mitochondrial morphology varies by neuronal cell type and subcellular compartment; however, the functional significance of these differences is unclear. Hippocampal CA2 neurons are enriched for genes encoding mitochondrial proteins compared to CA1 neurons, suggesting a difference in metabolic demand across hippocampal circuits. However, whether CA2 neuron mitochondria are structurally or functionally distinct to support circuit-specific energy demands is unknown. Here we compared mitochondrial morphology, protein expression, and calcium levels across CA1 and CA2 circuits. We found mitochondria in CA2 dendrites were larger than mitochondria in CA1 dendrites. However, both subregions harbored larger mitochondria in the entorhinal cortex (EC)-contacting distal dendrites compared to CA3-contacting proximal dendrites. Together, these data demonstrate both cell type- and input specific regulation of mitochondrial morphology that likely influences the function of these distinct circuits. To determine whether differences in mitochondrial fission or fusion account for cell and/or layer specific differences in morphology, we immunostained for OPA1 and MFF, which showed a general enrichment in distal dendrites relative to proximal dendrites, and an unexpected increase in CA1 distal dendrites compared to CA2 distal dendrites. To show whether these morphological differences result in functionally distinct mitochondria, we measured mitochondrial calcium levels in live slices. We found a striking enrichment of mitochondrial calcium levels in CA2 distal dendrites relative to proximal dendrites, and this layer-specific effect was significantly different from that in CA1 dendrites at baseline and after activity. Collectively, these findings reveal discrete morphological and functional differences in mitochondria across hippocampal subregions and dendritic layers, which likely confer unique circuit properties and/or vulnerabilities to disease.",

    "title": "BAG3 modulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis and tau uptake in astrocytes",
    "content": "In a healthy brain, astrocytes maintain neuronal homeostasis by removing proteins like tau from the extracellular space, preventing their uptake by neurons. In Alzheimer disease (AD), this function is impaired, contributing to tau accumulation. Many AD risk genes are linked to endocytosis pathways, suggesting their role in AD pathogenesis. Astrocytes can internalize, degrade, and release tau, but the mechanisms remain unclear. BAG3, a multifunctional protein, regulates vacuolar processes and interacts with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) components. However, its role in astrocytic CME and tau processing is not fully understood. We show BAG3 depletion in astrocytes reduces clathrin-AP-2 interaction, inhibits CME-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor internalization, and decreases tau uptake. Live-cell imaging reveals BAG3 depletion impairs CME dynamics, increasing clathrin particle lifetimes. BAG3 depletion also alters endolysosomal compartments, increasing Lamp1+ puncta and tau co-localization. These findings highlight BAG3s role in CME, tau trafficking, and vacuolar processes, suggesting its dysfunction may contribute to AD pathogenesis.",

Neuroimaging biomarkers were established as the increased and decreased functional connectivity indices of anatomically defined regions covering the whole brain. The algorithm was implemented through an iterative refinement process that converged on a division of UWS and MCS patients into representative and excluded (or nonrepresentative) patient groups.ResultsThirty-one out of 58 UWS patients and 23 out of 30 MCS patients were identified as representative, with an average classification accuracy of 90.2% in differentiating between the two groups. In contrast, differentiating between excluded UWS patients (n =\u202f27) and representative MCS patients (n =\u202f23) and between all UWS (n =\u202f58) and MCS (n =\u202f30) patients produced average classification accuracies of 50.9 and 64.3%, respectively. Furthermore, altered DMN functional connectivity between representative UWS and MCS patients revealed a consistent pattern as shown in prior studies, while comparisons involving excluded patients did not.DiscussionThese results highlight the value of integrating behavioral scores and neural connectivity features for DOC classification, providing a more coherent basis for downstream analysis and machine-learning applications in DOC classification.",

    "content": "BackgroundRetroclival subdural hematoma (rcSDH) secondary to spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an exceedingly rare clinical entity, characterized by complex and incompletely understood pathophysiological mechanisms.CaseA 24-year-old female presented with acute and persistent orthostatic headache, with no history of trauma or anticoagulant therapy. Neuroimaging revealed subdural hematomas (SDH) located in the retroclival, infratentorial, and right frontal regions. It was hypothesized that veinous rupture, resulting from venous traction due to decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, was the underlying mechanism. Following epidural blood patch (EBP) therapy, the patient exhibited marked symptomatic improvement and radiological resolution of hematomas on follow-up imaging.ConclusionRcSDH is considered an uncommon complication of SIH, potentially resulting from venous rupture in the retroclival subdural space due to reduced CSF pressure. SIH should be considered in cases of rcSDH. The treatment is typically focused on addressing the underlying etiology, with early diagnosis and timely intervention being essential for achieving favorable outcomes. In cases of severe brainstem compression, hematoma evacuation should be performed in conjunction with EBP.",

    "title": "Skull stripping tools in pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans: a retrospective evaluation of segmentation performance",
    "content": "IntroductionFor brain maturity assessment of infants aged above 6 months, T2-weighted MRI scans are recommended. Prior to automated brain tissue analysis, skull stripping is typically applied. However, most skull stripping tools neither focus on T2-weighted scans nor on pediatric cohorts. Here, we present the evaluation results of seven common skull stripping tools in a comparably large pediatric cohort.MethodsThis study is based on 199 T2-weighted scans of children under the age of 5 years retrospectively acquired from the clinical routine at Hannover Medical School. We established a manually labeled ground truth under quality control of a senior neuroradiologist specialized in pediatric neuroradiology and evaluated seven skull stripping tools (BET, ROBEX, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast, SynthStrip, SynthStrip-noCSF and d-SynthStrip). Segmentation performance (Dice score, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, sensitivity, specificity) and computation time were assessed on non-preprocessed and preprocessed scans (zero padding, contrast enhancement, artifact removal and normalization) as well as in different brain regions. For the best performing model, we manually assessed the top and bottom quartile of segmentations with respect to the integrity of different anatomical brain structures.ResultsOnly BET, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast profited from data preprocessing. Considering this, all models had median Dice scores between 0.88 and 0.96, with SynthStrip performing best. All models segmented most accurately in the middle axial slices of the brain. Resampling lowered the performance of all models, except ROBEX. Mean computing times ranged from 2\u202fs (BET) to 132\u202fs (HD-BET) with SynthStrip requiring 7\u202fs. per scan. SynthStrip was prone to not entirely including the Sinus sagittalis superior, the upper Cerebrum, the temporal pole, the Cerebellum and the Chiasma opticum/pituitary gland. In contrast, the petrous bone and the skull in the middle axial slices have often been partly included.DiscussionDue to its robustness and quick computation time, we recommend SynthStrip for skull stripping of pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans. We attribute the observed segmentation errors to the partial volume effect, which should be addressed in future research. Limitations of our study include the monocentric setting, the exclusion of pathological cases and the skewed age distribution in our cohort.",

    "title": "Strengthening interhemispheric connectivity increases interregional information transfer between human primary motor areas",
    "content": "Communication between brain regions is thought to be supported by the temporal alignment of their oscillatory activity creating rhythmic windows of opportunity for efficient information transfer. We examined this possibility by manipulating the strength of coupling between the left primary motor cortex (lM1) and the right primary motor cortex (rM1) and examined the impact on activity transfer between the two areas measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in 60 right-handed individuals. In three experiments we manipulated the strength of the pathway connecting the lM1 and rM1 by applying paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) using three different patterns, two of which increase interregional coupling strength. We measured the impact on EEG communication transfer in the alpha, beta, and theta bands at rest. Augmenting the strength of the lM1-to-rM1 pathway enhanced the interregional communication volume in the high-theta/low alpha band, and both volume and speed in the beta band, respectively. These changes, visible at rest, are related to changes in the transcallosal inhibitory influence of the lM1 over rM1 cortical excitability following ccPAS. By contrast, augmenting the rM1-to-lM1 route failed to modulate communication transfer in right-handed individuals. The results provide direct evidence of oscillatory intra-areal information transfer, demonstrating a link between motor network physiology and the resonant frequencies mediating its interactions.",

    "content": "Perceptual learning improves sensory discrimination, yet the brain must balance specificity and generalization, especially in variable environments. To investigate how variability shapes perceptual learning, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging while human subjects performed an orientation discrimination task with low or high task-irrelevant variability in spatial frequency. Behaviorally, both training regimes improved performance, but only high variability training enabled transfer to a novel location. Retinotopic orientation representations in early visual areas changed similarly across groups, indicating that variability does not alter local sensory representations. In contrast, functional connectivity differed: low variability training enhanced task-dependent coupling between the intraparietal sulcus and V2, while high variability training differentially affected connectivity with hV4. These results support a \"sweet spot\" model of perceptual learning, in which the locus of learning flexibly depends on the training environment. But rather than modifying sensory representations, variability reconfigures network-level readout, enabling specific or generalizable improvements in perception.",

    "content": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting brain functional connectivity (FC) from structural connectivity (SC), yet their \"black-box\" nature limits interpretability and scientific utility. We present a concept-driven disentanglement framework that builds inherently interpretable GNNs for quantitative hypothesis testing of structure-function relationships. The framework employs an ensemble of GNN branches, each architecturally biased to learn from a predefined structural concept (e.g., strong vs. weak connections) by processing a filtered version of the SC graph. This design enforces verifiably disentangled node embeddings, ensuring each branch captures a distinct structural feature. Using SHAP (Shapley additive explanations), we quantify the predictive contribution of each concept and assess its statistical significance against null distributions. Our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for FC, achieving a group-level correlation coefficient of 0.91 on a public human connectome dataset, while simultaneously yielding interpretable neuroscientific insights. This interpretable-by-design methodology bridges the gap between predictive power and scientific transparency, enabling deep learning models to provide mechanistic insights into the brain's network organization.",

    "content": "Empathic behaviors are sensitive to environmental factors like post-weaning social isolation (SI), yet the mechanisms by which SI affects empathy remain unclear. Here, we show that mice subjected to SI exhibit marked impairments in contagious pain and prosocial behaviors, including allo-grooming and allo-licking toward cagemates experiencing inflammatory pain. Mechanistically, we identify the glutamatergic projection from the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM) to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as critical for these empathy-like responses. SI induces hypoexcitability of OFC glutamatergic neurons and attenuates excitatory synaptic transmission within the VM[-&gt;]OFC pathway. Remarkably, chemogenetic activation of OFC neurons or the VM[-&gt;]OFC projection restores empathic behaviors in SI mice. Furthermore, we uncover a molecular basis for SI-induced OFC hypoexcitability: the downregulation of Grik3, encoding a kainate-type glutamate receptor subunit. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized thalamocortical mechanism through which early-life social deprivation disrupts empathic behaviors, offering insights into the underpinnings of social-affective dysfunction.",

    "title": "Distributed fMRI patterns coupled to low-frequency cardiorespiratory dynamics provide markers of aging",
    "content": "How aging affects brain-body connections can be investigated through changes in the coupling between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals and bodily autonomic processes across the adult lifespan. Recent studies using univariate approaches have identified age-related changes in the association between fMRI signals from multiple individual brain regions and low-frequency respiratory and cardiac activity. Here, we investigate if whole-brain spatial fMRI patterns associated with low-frequency physiological processes (heart rate and respiratory volume fluctuations) present generalizable changes with age. Data from human participants of both sexes are included in the analysis. We find that chronological age can be predicted statistically beyond chance from patterns of low-frequency fMRI-physiology coupling, even after accounting for individual differences in physiological signal characteristics and brain anatomy. Notably, brain areas implicated in central autonomic regulation, including nodes within salience and ventral attention networks (e.g., insula and middle cingulate cortex), are amongst the strongest contributors to age prediction. Further, we observe that after removing physiological effects from fMRI data, the residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability is still a reliable indicator of age. Together, these findings underscore the close integration between brain and body physiology, and highlight this interaction as a potential biomarker of the aging process.",

    "title": "An fMRI study of composition in noun and verb phrases",
    "content": "How do the language areas of the human brain combine multiple words into meaningful phrases and sentences remains ill-understood. Here, to address this question, we determined the response profile of temporal and inferior frontal language areas to the composition of up to four words into phrases. We tested whether brain activity increases with the number of merged words, and whether this profile differs for noun and verb phrases. To this aim, we used fMRI to quantify the brain responses to individual noun and verb phrases of varying length and to tightly matched word lists. Increasing phrase length was associated to an increase in activation in all regions of the temporo-frontal language network. The effect was more pronounced for phrases built around verbs than for phrases built around nouns, suggesting that verbs involve a more complex syntactic tree structure than nouns. Even with word lists, several regions, notably the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars triangularis and opercularis and the posterior superior temporal sulcus showed clear increases in activity with the length of sequences, although the words could not be merged into phrases. By contrast, other regions (IFG pars orbitalis, anterior temporal lobe, temporo-parietal junction) did not react to scrambled word lists. Those different functional response profiles inform theories of how composition is implemented in the human brain.",

    "title": "Residual photoreceptors affect the response of a degenerate retina to electrical stimulation",
    "content": "Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) implanted with the PRIMA photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis demonstrated letter acuity closely matching the device's 100 {micro}m pixel size. Improving visual acuity requires smaller pixels, which, in turn, require relaxation of electric field confinement to maintain effective stimulation of bipolar cells. Eliminating local return electrodes broadens the electric field but may inadvertently engage residual photoreceptors adjacent to the implant, thereby altering electrically evoked visual percepts. Here we quantify the contribution of residual photoreceptors to electrically evoked retinal responses across various implant configurations. Monopolar photovoltaic arrays with 20 {micro}m pixels and bipolar arrays with 100 {micro}m pixels were implanted subretinally in Long Evans rats, resulting in local degeneration of photoreceptors directly above the device. Responses were compared with those obtained in RCS rats, which lack functional photoreceptors. Implants were activated by patterns of 880 nm laser at pulse durations varying from 0.5 to 10 ms. Visually evoked potentials were measured in scotopic and photopic conditions, with and without the intravitreal application of mGluR6 agonist L-AP4 to block photoreceptor-driven ON pathways. Experimental thresholds were interpreted using a computational model of retinal network activation in distinct electric field geometries. In locally degenerate retina stimulated with monopolar arrays, blocking photoreceptor input yielded a rheobase (0.06 mW/mm2) and chronaxie (~3 ms) of the stimulation threshold, matching that measured in fully degenerate RCS retina, indicating direct activation of bipolar cells. In contrast, when photoreceptor input was intact, stimulation thresholds decreased significantly, and dark adaptation further modulated the threshold in a pulse-duration dependent manner. Bipolar arrays provided identical thresholds in locally degenerate and fully degenerate retina (0.2 mW/mm2) when stimulation was confined to the implant center; however, shifting stimulation to the implant's edge lowered the thresholds, revealing a contribution from adjacent photoreceptors. These findings demonstrate that residual photoreceptors can substantially influence responses evoked by subretinal prostheses in a degenerate retina, with direct consequences for perceptual uniformity in patients, such as edge brightening. These results provide guidance for design of the next-generation higher-resolution implants, supporting the use of local return electrodes to maximize resolution while minimizing the effect of photoreceptors in clinical applications.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

    "content": "BackgroundDeep brain stimulation (DBS) significantly improves tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but gait and speech remain inconsistent. These discrepancies underscore the need for a systematic, quantitative synthesis of existing data to clarify the impact of DBS across different motor domains.ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate the effects of DBS on motor symptoms in PD by analyzing UPDRS-III scores and conducting subgroup analyses based on stimulation target, stimulation type, and medication status.MethodsA literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies on clinical trials and observational studies reporting pre- and post-DBS motor assessments in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science from inception to 15 December 2024.ResultsA total of 35 studies comprising 1,082 PD patients were included. The pooled analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall UPDRS-III scores post-DBS (WMD: = \u22121.09, 95% CI: \u22121.32 to \u22120.87, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Subgroup analyses showed consistent improvements across tremor, rigidity, akinesia, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and axial symptoms, regardless of stimulation target or medication state. UPDRS Part IV scores also significantly improved, reflecting reduced motor complications. However, speech function remained unchanged, and UPDRS Part I scores initially showed no significant improvement, though significance emerged after removing sources of heterogeneity.ConclusionDBS significantly improves overall motor function, particularly tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, its effects on gait and speech remain inconsistent, which shows the need for further research to refine patient selection and optimize stimulation parameters. These findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic impact of DBS in PD management.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe application of motor imagery in human\u2013computer interaction and rehabilitative medicine has attracted growing attention due to recent advances in brain\u2013computer interface technologies. However, traditional EEG decoding paradigms based on fixed frequency\u2013band segmentation often exhibit limited performance because they fail to capture individual variability in brain rhythms.MethodsThis work proposes an adaptive method that integrates the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to optimize sub\u2013band segmentation for motor imagery EEG decoding. SSA adaptively searches for optimal sub\u2013band boundaries, enabling individualized frequency\u2013band selection.ResultsExperiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset under a cross\u2013session evaluation protocol (training on session T, testing on session E) demonstrated that SSA\u2013FBCSP effectively improves frequency\u2013band adaptability. The SSA\u2013FBCSP approach was further combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k\u2013Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers to evaluate the influence of different downstream classifiers.ConclusionAmong them, SSA\u2013FBCSP\u2013LDA achieved the best performance, outperforming the conventional uniform sub\u2013band approach by 21.76% and reaching an average accuracy of 89.92%. The adaptively selected sub\u2013bands closely matched the ERD/ERS distribution, confirming the method\u2019s effectiveness in frequency\u2013band optimization. Compared with recent deep\u2013learning\u2013based MI\u2013EEG models, the proposed technique offers a balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, providing a promising direction for personalized brain\u2013computer interface systems.",

    "title": "Integrated auditory-vocal embodied training for expressive authentic intonation in Chinese zither performance",
    "content": "BackgroundChinese zither music relies on culturally specific microtones (e. g., FA+ and TI\u2013) that differ from Western equal temperament, yet prolonged exposure to standardized tuning often leads to the erosion of these traditional intonation practices. While embodied cognition theory emphasizes the role of sensorimotor integration in learning, its application to the acquisition of non-fixed pitch systems in intangible cultural heritage music remains underexplored.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether a structured auditory-vocal embodied training protocol\u2014integrating listening, vocal imitation, and metaphoric gestures\u2014could enhance zither learners' accuracy in producing traditional microtones, and to provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of embodied cognition theory in sustaining culturally authentic musical intonation.MethodsA quasi-experimental design was employed with 63 intermediate-level zither students. Participants were assigned to an experimental group, which completed a 1-week auditory-vocal-gestural training program, or a control group, which continued regular practice without multimodal integration. Pitch accuracy on two critical tones (FA+ and TI\u2013) was assessed through pre- and post-tests.ResultsThe experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Chinese-style pitch accuracy compared to the control group, along with a marked shift in intonation perception away from equal-tempered biases.ConclusionThe findings indicate that multisensory embodied training, grounded in the principles of perceptual-motor coupling and gestural simulation, effectively promotes the internalization of traditional microtonal intonation. This study not only offers a novel pedagogical approach for preserving intangible cultural heritage in music education but also substantiates the role of embodied cognition in acquiring culturally situated sensorimotor skills.",

    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD), a synucleopathy characterized by the presence of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates in the brain, is thought to originate in the intestine. Desulfovibrio, resident gut sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), usually found in very low numbers in a healthy gut, are found in higher numbers in PD. In a recent study, a separate group demonstrated that Desulfovibrio isolated from both PD patients and healthy subjects were fed to C. elegans and were found to increase \u03b1-syn aggregates in the head region of the worms. How these bacteria induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in the brain through the gut remain unknown. We tested whether Desulfovibrio induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in the intestinal cells and triggered \u03b1-syn secretion from these cells into the growth medium and whether this growth medium (devoid of bacteria) further induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neurons. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio directly induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neuronal cells and inhibited protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key dopamine-producing enzyme. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio increased \u03b1-syn levels in intestine, plasma, and in brain in mice.MethodsEnteroendocrine STC-1 and neuronal SH-Sy5y cells were infected with Desulfovibriovulgaris (DSV). We measured \u03b1-syn aggregation by immunofluorescence. \u03b1-syn levels in cell culture supernatant (sup), tissues, and plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Protein expression of TH and \u03b1-syn was analyzed by Western blot.ResultsWe found that DSV increased the number of STC-1cells with \u03b1-syn aggregates and also induced \u03b1-syn expression in these cells. Sup from DSV-infected STC-1 had higher \u03b1-syn levels compared to control uninfected sup and could induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in SH-Sy5y. DSV also directly induced a syn aggregates and inhibited TH in SH-Sy5y. DSV-gavaged mice had higher levels of \u03b1-syn in the duodenum, plasma, and in brain and also showed a decreasing trend in TH expression in the brain.ConclusionThus, our findings provide a gut-to-brain link tied to the ability of SRB in the gut-to increase expression, aggregation and spread of \u03b1-syn and decrease of TH in PD.",

    "content": "Moderate-volume brainstem hemorrhage (>5 mL) typically carries an extremely poor prognosis. This article presents a rare case of survival following a large-volume brainstem hemorrhage with therapeutic intervention. A 47-year-old male with hypertension presented with sudden-onset coma. CT imaging revealed a 10.3 mL brainstem hemorrhage. The patient underwent hematoma puncture drainage and tracheostomy, accompanied by hemostatic therapy, intracranial pressure reduction, anti-infection treatment, and neurorehabilitation. During treatment, the patient developed recurrent multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. After 2 months, the patient gradually regained consciousness with improved limb muscle strength, though exhibiting motor aphasia, dysphagia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Rehabilitation therapy was continued. This case demonstrates that even with large-volume brainstem hemorrhage, comprehensive management including timely drainage, intracranial pressure control, tracheostomy, infection management, and early rehabilitation may achieve survival and consciousness recovery. However, as a single-case report, this study has limited sample size, necessitating further large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings.",

    "content": "BackgroundEarly neurological deterioration (END) occurs in 43%\u201360% of patients with anterior choroidal artery (AChA) territory infarction. While brain atrophy serves as an imaging biomarker of diminished brain reserve capacity and may influence stroke outcomes, its predictive value for END in AChA infarction remains unclear.MethodsThis dual-center retrospective cohort study consecutively enrolled patients with acute AChA territory infarction admitted to two Chinese stroke centers between September 2018 and September 2024. Clinical T1-weighted images were reconstructed into standardized high-resolution images using the SynthSR deep learning algorithm, followed by fully automated brain tissue segmentation via AssemblyNet. We calculated gray matter fraction (GMF), white matter fraction (WMF), brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), and cerebrospinal fluid fraction (CSFF) to quantify brain atrophy severity. Multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to assess associations between brain atrophy metrics and END.ResultsAmong 206 enrolled patients, 78 (37.86%) developed END. Patients with END demonstrated significantly greater brain atrophy: GMF (P < 0.001), WMF (P < 0.001), and BPF (P < 0.001) were all significantly reduced, while CSFF was correspondingly elevated (P < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, each 0.01-unit increase in WMF was associated with a 58% reduction in END risk (P < 0.001); each 0.01-unit increase in BPF corresponded to a 32% risk reduction (P = 0.002); and each 0.01-unit increase in CSFF was associated with a 52% increase in risk (P < 0.001). Quartile analysis confirmed dose-response relationships: the highest quartiles of WMF and BPF were associated with 91% and 74% reductions in END risk, respectively, while the highest CSFF quartile conferred a 6.2-fold increased risk. RCS analysis confirmed significant linear dose-response relationships between both BPF and CSFF with END (both P-non-linear > 0.05).ConclusionAutomated brain atrophy quantification based on routine clinical MRI can independently predict END risk in patients with AChA infarction, providing a feasible imaging biomarker for this high-risk stroke population and facilitating early risk stratification and treatment optimization.",

In these applications, synchronized visuomotor feedback can evoke a sense of body ownership and agency, contributing to the experience of embodiment. We extend this work by employing embreathment, the representation of the user's own breath in real time, as a means for enhancing user embodiment experience in robots. In a within-subjects experiment, participants controlled a robotic arm, while its movements were either synchronized or non-synchronized with their own breath. Synchrony was shown to significantly increase body ownership, and was preferred by most participants.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.15514v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose a methodology to improve figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), ensuring that all modifications remain scientifically rigorous. IPCC figures are notoriously difficult to understand, and although designers have proposed alternatives, these lack formal IPCC validation and can be dismissed by skeptics. To address this gap, our approach starts from official IPCC figures. We gather their associated learning objectives and devise tests to score a pool of figure readers to assess how well they learn the objectives.We define improvement as higher scores obtained by a comparable reader pool after viewing a revised figure, where all modifications undergo review to ensure scientific validity. This assessment gives freedom to designers, who can deviate from the original design while making sure the objectives are still met and improved. We demonstrate the methodology through a case study and describe unexpected challenges encountered during the process.",

Results show that pairing gestures for navigation with either Dwell time or Pursuits for selection improves task completion time and rate compared to using either individually. We discuss the implications of pairing gaze input techniques, such as how Pursuits may negatively impact other techniques, likely due to the visual clutter it adds, how integrating gestures for navigation reduces the chances of unintentional selections, and the impact of motor activity on performance.

    "title": "Exploring User Acceptance and Concerns toward LLM-powered Conversational Agents in Immersive Extended Reality",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.15343v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life. The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency. When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive. Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful. We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.15325v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Organizations increasingly operate in environments characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), where early indicators of change often emerge as weak, fragmented signals. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used to support managerial decision-making, most AI-based systems remain optimized for prediction and resolution, leading to premature interpretive closure under conditions of high ambiguity. This creates a gap in management science regarding how human-AI systems can responsibly manage ambiguity before it crystallizes into error or crisis. This study addresses this gap by presenting a proof of concept (PoC) of the LAIZA human-AI augmented symbiotic intelligence system and its patented process: Systems and Methods for Quantum-Inspired Rogue Variable Modeling (QRVM), Human-in-the-Loop Decoherence, and Collective Cognitive Inference. The mechanism operationalizes ambiguity as a non-collapsed cognitive state, detects persistent interpretive breakdowns (rogue variables), and activates structured human-in-the-loop clarification when autonomous inference becomes unreliable. Empirically, the article draws on a three-month case study conducted in 2025 within the AI development, involving prolonged ambiguity surrounding employee intentions and intellectual property boundaries. The findings show that preserving interpretive plurality enabled early scenario-based preparation, including proactive patent protection, allowing decisive and disruption-free action once ambiguity collapsed. The study contributes to management theory by reframing ambiguity as a first-class construct and demonstrates the practical value of human-AI symbiosis for organizational resilience in VUCA environments.",

Addressing gaps in prior research, such as limited use of immersive technology and reliance on distracting peripherals, we developed a novel JA training platform using Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) devices. The platform integrates eye gaze-based interactions to ensure participants undivided attention. To validate the platform, we conducted experiments on ASD (N=19) and Neurotypical (NT) (N=13) participants under a trained pediatric neurologist's supervision. For quantitative analysis, we employed key measures such as the number of correct responses, the duration of establishing eye contact (s), and the duration of registering a response (s), along with correlations to CARS scores and age. Results from AR-based experiments showed NT participants registered responses significantly faster (<0.00001) than ASD participants. A correlation (Spearman coefficient=0.57, p=0.03) was found between ASD participants response time and CARS scores. A similar trend was observed in VR-based experiments. When comparing response accuracy in ASD participants across platforms, AR yielded a higher correctness rate (92.30%) than VR (69.49%), indicating AR's greater effectiveness. These findings suggest that immersive technology can aid JA training in ASD. Future studies should explore long-term benefits and real-world applicability.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.15117v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: General-purpose conversational AI chatbots and AI companions increasingly provide young adolescents with emotionally supportive conversations, raising questions about how conversational style shapes anthropomorphism and emotional reliance. In a preregistered online experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads, youth aged 11-15 and their parents read two matched transcripts in which a chatbot responded to an everyday social problem using either a relational style (first-person, affiliative, commitment language) or a transparent style (explicit nonhumanness, informational tone). Adolescents more often preferred the relational than the transparent style, whereas parents were more likely to prefer transparent style than adolescents. Adolescents rated the relational chatbot as more human-like, likable, trustworthy and emotionally close, while perceiving both styles as similarly helpful. Adolescents who preferred relational style had lower family and peer relationship quality and higher stress and anxiety than those preferring transparent style or both chatbots. These findings identify conversational style as a key design lever for youth AI safety, showing that relational framing heightens anthropomorphism, trust and emotional closeness and can be especially appealing to socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, who may be at increased risk for emotional reliance on conversational AI.",

While HCAI has gained prominence in academic discourse and organizational practice, its implementation remains constrained by the absence of methodological guidance and structured frameworks. In particular, HCAI and organizational design practices are often treated separately, despite their interdependence in shaping effective socio-technical systems. This chapter addresses this gap by introducing the Human-Centered AI Maturity Model (HCAI-MM), a structured framework that enables organizations to evaluate, monitor, and advance their capacity to design and implement HCAI solutions. The model specifies stages of maturity, metrics, tools, governance mechanisms, and best practices, supported by case studies, while also incorporating an organizational design methodology that operationalizes maturity progression. Encompassing dimensions such as human-AI collaboration, explainability, fairness, and user experience, the HCAI-MM provides a roadmap for organizations to move from novice to advanced levels of maturity, aligning AI technologies with human values and organizational design principles.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.14965v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social media platforms have faced increasing scrutiny over whether and how they protect youth online. While online risks to children have been well-documented by prior research, how social media platforms communicate about these risks and their efforts to improve youth safety have not been holistically examined. To fill this gap, we analyzed N=352 press releases and safety-related blogs published between 2019 and 2024 by four platforms popular among youth: YouTube, TikTok, Meta (Facebook and Instagram), and Snapchat. Leveraging both inductive and deductive qualitative approaches, we developed a comprehensive framework of seven problem areas where risks arise, and a taxonomy of safety features that social media platforms claim address these risks. Our analysis revealed uneven emphasis across problem areas, with most communications focused on Content Exposure and Interpersonal Communication, whereas less emphasis was placed on Content Creation, Data Access, and Platform Access. Additionally, we identified three problematic communication practices related to their described safety features, including discrepancies between feature implementation and availability, unclear or inconsistent explanations of safety feature operation, and a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of safety features in mitigating risks once implemented. Based on these findings, we discuss the communication gaps between risks and the described safety features, as well as the tensions in achieving transparency in platform communication. Our analysis of platform communication informs guidelines for responsibly communicating about youth safety features.",

It is a worthwhile technique in medical and psychological research, but also relatively niche. Here we present a tutorial on the acquisition and analysis of the human electrogastrogram. Because dedicated equipment and software can be prohibitively expensive, we demonstrate how data can be acquired using a low-cost OpenBCI Ganglion amplifier. We also present a processing pipeline that minimises attrition, which is particularly helpful for low-cost equipment but also applicable to top-of-the-line hardware. Our approach comprises outlier rejection, frequency filtering, movement filtering, and noise reduction using independent component analysis. Where traditional approaches include a subjective step in which only one channel is manually selected for further analysis, our pipeline recomposes the electrogastrogram from all recorded channels after automatic rejection of nuisance components. The main benefits of this approach are reduced attrition, retention of data from all recorded channels, and reduced influence of researcher bias. In addition to our tutorial on the method, we offer a proof-of-principle in which our approach leads to reduced data rejection compared to established methods. We aimed to describe each step in sufficient detail to be implemented in any programming language. In addition, we made an open-source Python package freely available for ease of use.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.15671v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The neural basis of probabilistic computations remains elusive, even amidst growing evidence that humans and other animals track their uncertainty. Recent work has proposed that probabilistic representations arise naturally in task-optimized neural networks trained without explicitly probabilistic inductive biases. However, prior work has lacked clear criteria for distinguishing probabilistic representations, those that perform transformations characteristic of probabilistic computation, from heuristic neural codes that merely reformat inputs. We propose a novel information bottleneck framework, the functional information bottleneck (fIB), that crucially evaluates a neural representation based not only on its statistical sufficiency but also on its minimality, allowing us to disambiguate heuristic from probabilistic coding. To demonstrate the power of this framework, we study a variety of task-optimized neural networks that had been suggested to develop probabilistic representations in earlier work: networks trained to perform static inference tasks (such as cue combination and coordinate transformation) or dynamic state estimation tasks (Kalman filtering). In contrast to earlier claims, our minimality requirement reveals that probabilistic representations fail to emerge in these networks: they do not develop minimal codes of Bayesian posteriors in their hidden layer activities, and instead rely on heuristic input recoding. Therefore, it remains an open question under which conditions truly probabilistic representations emerge in neural networks. More generally, our work provides a stringent framework for identifying probabilistic neural codes. Thus, it lays the foundation for systematically examining whether, how, and which posteriors are represented in neural circuits during complex decision-making tasks.",

    "title": "The Role of Affect and Priors in the Generation of Hallucinations in Early Psychosis",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.14743v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Background: Stress and negative affect play significant roles in developing psychosis. Bayesian analyses applied to the conditioned hallucinations (CH) task suggest that hallucinations arise when maladaptive prior beliefs outweigh sensory evidence. Prior weighting is linked to hallucination severity, yet the nature of these priors remains unclear. Negative affect may influence the strength of maladaptive priors. We hypothesized that, under stress, participants will show increased CH rates and prior weighting, with this effect more pronounced in patients.\n  Methods: This study employs a modified CH task using valenced linguistic stimuli and stress and non-stress affective manipulations. The sample for this pilot study included those at risk for psychosis and patients with first episode psychosis (N=12) and healthy controls (N=15). The objective of this study was first to validate this affective version of the CH task and then to demonstrate an effect of affect on CH rates and prior weighting.\n  Results: Replicating past results, patients had higher CH rates (b = 0.061, p < 0.001) and prior weighting (b = 0.097, p < 0.001) for session 1 compared to controls (n=15) across conditions. Further, runs with stress manipulations had higher prior weighting across patients and controls compared to runs with non-stress manipulations (b = 0.054, p = 0.033).\n  Conclusions: This study validates this affective version of the CH task and provides preliminary evidence of a relationship between affective state and prior weighting. Future work will be aimed at confirming and extending these findings, with the objective of developing biomarkers of early psychosis.\n  Key words: Schizophrenia, Affect, Priors, Computational Psychiatry, Clinical High Risk Population, Psychotic Symptoms",

    "title": "Maternal IL-17A administration fails to disrupt fetal cortical lamination in the absence of maternal microbes",
    "content": "Maternal inflammation during pregnancy can disrupt fetal neurodevelopment and contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has emerged as a potential mediator linking maternal immune activation (MIA) to neurodevelopmental abnormalities in offspring. Production of this cytokine is in-part regulated by the maternal gastrointestinal microbiome. However, it remains unclear whether IL-17A alone is sufficient to induce offspring brain abnormalities independent of maternal microbial signals. This study tests the potential for IL-17A to mediate fetal brain cortical architecture through administration of recombinant (r)IL-17A to pregnant germ-free (GF) dams. Pregnant GF mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of rIL-17A for six days, covering the mid- to latter half of the gestational period. Placental tissue was processed for histopathological evaluation, and cortical lamination was examined in the fetal brain using gold-standard immunohistochemical approaches. Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), a novel label-free imaging technique, was employed to further quantify cortical architecture. This is the first report of SLIM imaging performed in the mouse embryonic brain. Overall, administration of rIL-17A to pregnant GF dams during mid-to-late gestation resulted in normal placental morphology and fetal cortical lamination patterns, suggesting that IL-17A alone is insufficient for altering cortical neurodevelopment, at least at this gestational timepoint. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for the maternal microbiome when interpreting the impacts of prenatal inflammation on brain development in utero.",

    "title": "DYT1 mutation alters gut microbiome composition and gut-brain axis dynamics in a mouse model",
    "content": "Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary, sustained, or intermittent muscle contractions, that result in twisting movements, repetitive motor patterns, or abnormal postures. While genetic mutations such as Tor1a+/{triangleup}GAG are known contributors, the environmental and peripheral factors influencing disease onset and progression remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence implicates the gut microbiome in shaping neurodevelopment and host behavioral function, yet its contribution to dystonia pathobiology is largely unexplored. Here, we longitudinally profiled the gut microbiome of Tor1a+/{triangleup}GAG mouse model using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and uncovered early emerging, persistent disruptions in microbial diversity and community composition that track with progressive motor impairment. Mutant mice exhibited an alteration of key commensal taxa, and molecular signatures indicative of compromised gut-barrier integrity. Parallel transcriptomic profiling of colonic epithelium reveals coordinated dysregulation of pathways governing epithelial stress responses, endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, lipid signaling, autophagy, and DNA damage and repair, pointing to a previously unrecognized epithelial stress state in Tor1a+/{triangleup}GAG mouse model. Integrative microbial-host interaction correlation analyses uncovered robust associations between specific dysbiotic taxa and host signaling pathways. These peripheral perturbations coincide with longitudinal motor deficits, suggesting a mechanistic gut-brain axis linking intestinal dysfunction to central neuronal vulnerability. Together, our findings provide the first experimental framework connecting microbiome perturbations, gut-barrier disruption, and neuronal vulnerability in a genetic model of dystonia. This work positions the gut microbiome and its regulation of epithelial and neuronal homeostasis as a novel entry point for disease modification in individuals carrying deleterious dystonia-associated variants.",

    "title": "High-Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation Reorganizes Cortical Cross-Frequency Coupling in a Region- and Time-Dependent Manner",
    "content": "Pain management strategies have progressed beyond traditional pharmacologic and physical interventions, integrating advanced neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, and high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (hSCS). Despite its clinical efficacy, the supraspinal mechanisms underlying hSCS remain poorly understood. Prior work in sheep demonstrated that hSCS modulates gamma band (70-150 Hz) activity in the primary somatosensory and association cortices, implicating cortical involvement in pain modulation. Given, the interaction between low and high oscillations, we hypothesized that hSCS modulates gamma activity in a region- and time-dependent manner through specific coupling with theta rhythms (4-8 Hz). Using 96-channel subdural electrocorticography (ECoG), we computed theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and the corresponding modulation index (MI) to quantify the effects of hSCS. While the preferred theta phase of gamma activity remained consistent across conditions and regions, MI increased significantly post-stimulation, most prominently in the association cortex, where robust theta-gamma phase locking was observed. In contrast, the somatosensory cortex exhibited weaker and more variable locking. Temporally, both cortices demonstrated an early, rapid increase in MI post-hSCS, accompanied by a shift (association) and attenuation (somatosensory) of the secondary peak. These findings reveal distinct regional and temporal dynamics in PAC following hSCS and suggest complementary roles of somatosensory and association cortices in processing neuromodulatory input. hSCS appears to reorganize cortical cross-frequency interactions, supporting its role in reorganizing functional network dynamics relevant to sensory processing and the subjective pain experience.",

    "title": "Anesthesia-triggered dopaminergic bursts actively induce forgetting: a paradigm shift in understanding cold-shock amnesia",
    "content": "Retrograde memory loss, the inability to recall events preceding amnesia onset, is a well-documented consequence of anesthesia. Recent discoveries, pioneered by Drosophila research, have challenged the view that forgetting is a passive process, and have demonstrated that rather it is a highly active, well-regulated biological process. This work builds on this and makes a remarkable and unexpected discovery that anesthesia itself triggers a robust, widespread burst of activity in dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Here, we report that both cold-shock and CO2 anesthesia elicits strong activation in PAM and PPL1 DAN populations. This calcium activity is accompanied by robust synaptic release of dopamine. Strikingly, pharmacological experiments show that this response is input-driven, as it is completely abolished by Na+ channel blockers and dampened by nAChR antagonists. Using behavioral methods, crucially, we show that anesthesia-induced amnesia can be prevented by blocking activity in PAM and PPL1 neurons during anesthesia. Together, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized active mechanism by which anesthesia induces forgetting, mediated by rapid dopaminergic signaling. This paradigm-shifting discovery redefines how we think about anesthesia-induced amnesia and the biology of forgetting.",

    "content": "Mole-rats are subterranean rodents that have evolved remarkable sensory adaptations to life in underground tunnel systems, yet their neural mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a protocol for in vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake, head-fixed, and freely moving African mole-rats (Fukomys anselli/micklemi), overcoming unique challenges of studying the neurobiology of subterranean species. We find that mole-rat brain physiology impacts survival after surgeries, with higher carbon dioxide concentrations required for recovery compared to other rodents, likely due to a mutation in the chloride-potassium symporter KCC2. Having addressed these challenges through our optimized methodology, we used tetrodes and Neuropixels probes to record single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFP) across several cortical and subcortical regions for several weeks. We observed single units responsive to auditory and visual stimuli in the superior colliculus, and hippocampal recordings in freely moving mole-rats revealed prominent theta rhythms at frequencies lower than those observed in any other rodent species to date. Finally, we performed integrated three-dimensional and two-dimensional probe-track analysis within the same brain using tissue clearing, light sheet imaging, rehydration, and vibratome sectioning, and we present a newly developed stereotaxic brain atlas for implantation and histological alignment. This established methodology will guide future studies in comparative rodent neurobiology, providing further insights into neurobiological adaptations to subterranean environments. Given their phylogenetic and ecological similarities, we expect our protocols to be transferable to other subterranean species, including the widely studied naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber).",

Unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) produces behavioral, physiological, and molecular changes in zebrafish that parallel core features of human anxiety and depressive disorders; however, its impact on social outcomes remains unclear. Here, we examined whether a 14-day UCS protocol alters social behavior in adult zebrafish using two complementary assays: the social preference test and the shoal cohesion test. Across two independent experiments, UCS did not elicit detectable changes in individual social approach or group-level cohesion. In contrast, UCS induced clear anxiety-like behavior in the novel tank test, validating the stress manipulation, with stressed fish displaying reduced vertical exploration and decreased time in the upper zone. Shoal cohesion measures showed a time-dependent decrease in both groups, consistent with habituation to the testing environment rather than a stress-specific effect. Together, these results suggest that social behavior in adult zebrafish is relatively resilient to UCS under the conditions tested, whereas anxiety-like responses are markedly affected. Future work should investigate whether factors such as stressor intensity, developmental stage, sex composition, or social hierarchy modulate the sensitivity of social behavior to chronic stress.",

    "title": "Targeting Putrescine Homeostasis with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PS128 to Mitigate Autism-like Behaviors in Fmr1 KO Mice",
    "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often presents with gastrointestinal disturbances, yet the molecular mechanisms linking gut alterations to behavioral dysfunction remain incompletely understood. Using Fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout mice, we found that autism-like behaviors are associated with disrupted gut microbiota-polyamine metabolism and elevated putrescine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Supplementation with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PS128 reshaped gut microbial communities, improved intestinal integrity, and restored arginine-ornithine-polyamine metabolic homeostasis. PS128 normalized the serum-to-PFC putrescine imbalance and reduced expression of putrescine transporters in the PFC. Consistent with a causal role, peripheral putrescine elevation induced autism-like behaviors in wild-type mice, whereas inhibition of putrescine synthesis ameliorated behavioral deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice. Together, these findings identify putrescine dysregulation as an important metabolic contributor to autism-like phenotypes, support a metabolically stratifiable ASD subtype, and implicate PS128 as a psychobiotic intervention acting through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

Here we uncover new structural and dynamical features of the brain endothelial glycocalyx using in vivo two-photon microscopy. We identified glycocalyx enrichment at endothelial junctions and arteriolar branch points, visualized its vesicular transport in real-time, and found evidence for its compositional variations along the arteriovenous axis. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed two distinct kinetics of wheat germ agglutinin binding, including a previously undescribed one. Finally, super-localization of the glycocalyx estimated glycocalyx thickness as 775{+/-}17 nm and 622{+/-}34 nm before and after enzymatic shedding, reconciling discrepancies between past optical and electron microscopy estimates. Together these findings establish the first milti-scale framework of glycocalyx distribution and heterogeneity, transport, and molecular interaction kinetics in the living brain.",

    "title": "Implicit adaptations effect on sensorimotor and motor confidence",
    "content": "Sensorimotor adaptation maintains movement accuracy by counteracting perturbations or miscalibrations. It can operate explicitly, by consciously adjusting motor plans to correct errors, or implicitly, by automatically recalibrating sensorimotor mappings without altering the motor plan. While explicit adaptation is known to reduce sensorimotor confidence -- the perceived likelihood of successful action -- it is unclear whether implicit adaptation similarly affects confidence in sensorimotor judgments or motor awareness (knowledge of one's own limb position). To investigate this, participants made reaching movements to visual targets without seeing their hand. Cursor feedback followed an '' error-clamped '' trajectory: its radial position matched the hand, but its angular direction was fixed and independent of actual hand direction, a manipulation participants were told to ignore. The clamp direction varied sinusoidally over trials ({+/-} 10 {degrees} ; 12 cycles per session). Participants reported confidence by adjusting the size of an arc centered on the target or, in another task, centered on reported reach direction; larger arcs indicated lower confidence. Points were awarded when the arc encompassed the true reach direction, with fewer points for larger arcs, encouraging accurate and meaningful confidence reports. Fourier analysis of reach and report time series revealed a strong 12-cycle component in both, demonstrating robust implicit adaptation and corresponding changes in motor awareness. These findings indicate that although implicit adaptation operates unconsciously, the resulting mismatch between motor plans and proprioceptive signals can bias judgments of reach outcomes. However, confidence judgments were not consistently affected, suggesting that sensorimotor confidence and confidence in proprioceptive awareness may rely on partially distinct mechanisms.",

    "title": "Progressive muscle metabolic reprogramming in asymptomatic ALS gene mutation carriers",
    "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron loss leading to extensive paralysis. There is emerging evidence that the disease involves a prolonged presymptomatic period during which motor function is preserved. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved is key as the presymptomatic phase represents a critical window of opportunity for early intervention. Using RNA sequencing, we investigated changes in gene expression patterns in the skeletal muscle of ten asymptomatic carriers of ALS mutations (8 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 2 SOD1 mutation carriers). We found that specific modifications of gene expression profiles are present in skeletal muscle before asymptomatic ALS gene carriers exhibit biomarker changes predictive of phenoconversion. We identified insulin signaling, AMPK signaling, and thermogenesis pathways, together with the TCA cycle as the main contributors to the dysregulated muscle transcriptome. Our data suggest that this metabolic reprogramming of skeletal muscle develops progressively during the transition to phenoconversion, characterized by a gradual increase in the expression of SREBF1 which encodes SREPB1, the key transcriptional regulator of lipid synthesis, in parallel with the progressive activation of AMPK and insulin signaling pathways. Our findings are consistent with a progressive enhancement in fatty acid metabolism and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, followed by a decline in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency as phenoconversion approaches. Evidence of muscle metabolic reprogramming in ALS long before motor onset identifies the dysregulation of muscle energy homeostasis as a critical early event in ALS pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Echoes as Signal, Not Noise: Reverberation Sharpens Sensitivity to Temporal Structure",
    "content": "Sensitivity to temporal structure is fundamental to hearing, yet how natural reverberation shapes this sensitivity is unclear. Here we identify a general principle we term echo-facilitated temporal sensitivity (EFTS), in which the auditory system exploits reverberation as a computational resource to selectively and dose dependently enhance perceptual and neural responses to rapid temporal changes. Using transitional click trains with subtle inter click interval (ICI) shifts, human listeners showed monotonically improved change detection across simulated echo levels. Concurrent EEG revealed systematic increases of a late change response with echo strength, while onset responses remained stable, indicating a selective boost to temporal-structure-transition processing. In awake rats, electrocorticography over auditory cortex replicated these effects; single units exhibited echo level dependent increases in ICI transition evoked firing, and receiver operating characteristic neurometrics yielded steeper functions and lower discrimination thresholds. Laminar local field potential analysis further revealed that echo-dependent divergence emerged last in the supragranular layer, after appearing in the granular and infragranular layers, consistent with an initial thalamocortical drive followed by intracortical amplification. Together, these findings establish EFTS as a cross-species mechanism for ecologically grounded temporal computation, through which reverberation sharpens neural representations of temporal structure and enhances sensitivity to rapid pattern changes, reframing echoes as structured signals that the brain uses to naturally optimize temporal integration in everyday listening.",

    "title": "Infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) modulation of human brain pulsations in awake and sleep states",
    "content": "Human brain exhibits three propagating pulsations, namely cardiovascular, respiratory, and vasomotor waves, which together propel the flow of intracranial fluids. While their pulsation characteristics have been extensively studied, their causal interconnections have not been systematically investigated. Using ultrafast whole brain magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG), we analysed the frequency domain up to 5 Hz for cross-frequency oscillatory interactions in awake and NREM-sleep states of 23 healthy volunteers. Using transfer entropy (TE) analysis, we found that in the awake state the infra-slow (ISF < 0.1 Hz) oscillations of statistically independent resting state networks (RSN) largely drove the neurofluid (NF) pulsatility. NREM-sleep was associated with increased power of infra-slow fluctuation (ISF) vasomotor oscillations and with altered driving patterns between RSN and NF networks in the direction of a causally chained pattern. Importantly, within these independent signal sources, we found three distinct cross-frequency coupling frequency ranges occurring at ISF (<0.1 Hz), respiratory (~0.25 Hz), and cardiovascular (~1 Hz) frequencies, where the slower pulsations generally modulated the faster ones, except for a finding of inverted cardiorespiratory drive in NREM-2 sleep. These results indicate the presence of directional ISF-coordinated mechanisms underlying brain pulsations that contribute to driving the intracranial fluid transfer processes.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>I've been using lazygit and wanted something similar for databases. I was tired of having my computer eaten alive by bloated database clients (that's actually made for database admins, not for developers), and existing SQL TUIs were hard to use \u2013 I craved a keyboard-driven TUI that's intuitive and enjoyable to use.</p> <p>So I built Sqlit with Python and Textual. It connects to PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, DuckDB, Turso, Supabase, and more.</p> <p>Features:</p> <ul> <li> - Vim-style query editing with autocomplete</li> <li> - Context-based keybindings (always visible, no memorization)</li> <li> - SSH tunnel support</li> <li> - CLI mode with JSON/CSV output (useful for scripting and AI agents)</li> <li> - Themes (Tokyo Night, Gruvbox, Nord, etc.)</li> </ul> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Developers who work in the terminal and enjoy keyboard-driven tools, and want a fast way to query databases without launching heavy GUIs.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Other SQL TUIs like Harlequin require reading docs to learn keybindings and CLI flags. Sqlit follows the lazygit philosophy \u2013 just run it, and context-based help shows you what's available. It also has SSH tunnel support, which most TUIs lack</p> <p>Built entirely with Textual. Happy to answer questions about the architecture or Textual patterns I used.</p> <p>Link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Maxteabag/sqlit\">https://github.com/Maxteabag/sqlit</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maxteabag\"> /u/Maxteabag </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pouds2/i_built_a_lazygitstyle_sql_client_tui_with_textual/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pouds2/i_built_a_lazygitstyle_sql_client_tui_with_textual/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I had this Idea for over 3 years already. One time my manager called me at 3 AM on Friday and he was furious, the app I was working on crashed in production because of an unhandled error, while he was demoing it to a huge prospect. The app was using a document parsing lib that had infinite amount of edge cases (documents are messy, you can't even imagine how messy they can be). Now I finally implemented this idea. It's called Pyrethrin.</p> <ul> <li><strong>What My Project Does</strong> - It's a library that lets you create functions that explicitly define what exceptions it can raise or that it can return a None, and the other function using this one has to exhaustively implement all the cases, if any handle is missing or not handled at all, Pyrethrin will throw an error at &quot;compile&quot; time (on the first run in case of Python).</li> <li><strong>Target Audience</strong> - the tool is primarily designed for production use, especially in large Python teams. Other target audience is Python library developers, they can &quot;shield&quot; their library for their users to gain their trust (it will fail on their end way less than without Pyrethrin)</li> <li><strong>Comparison</strong> - I haven't seen anything like this, if you know an alternative please let me know.</li> </ul> <p>Go check it out, don't forget to star if you like it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/4tyone/pyrethrin\">https://github.com/4tyone/pyrethrin</a></p> <p>Edit: Here is the core static analyzer repo.

    "title": "SpotDMix: informed mRNA transcript assignment using mixture models",
    "content": "Unveiling the genetic profiles of spatially distinguished cells is an important aspect in many areas of brain research, as the genetic identity contains information about a cell's physiological properties and internal state. On top of this, knowledge of the genetic details of each cell can reveal structural organization within tissue. As image-based spatial transcriptomics moves toward applications in tissues with dense cellular packing, accurate assignment of detected mRNA transcripts (\"spots\") to correct segmented cells becomes increasingly difficult, rendering simple methods insufficient with many incorrect assignments to neighboring cells. Here we introduce SpotDMix, a statistical model for assigning spots to cells by modeling spots as coming from a mixture model of distributions matching segmented cell shapes, with assignment probabilities and shape parameters optimized using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Performance is assessed and compared against several simple methods in various scenarios on both surrogate data and larval zebrafish data. In all tested scenarios SpotDMix outperforms the simple methods on all evaluated metrics, including individual transcript assignment accuracy, total assigned number of spots per cell error and cell type classification. Further, SpotDMix produces a higher degree of exclusivity between genes which are known to not or rarely co-express.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "content": "<p>Hey HN! We\u2019re Rory, Chris, and Felix from Kenobi (<a href=\"https://kenobi.ai\">https://kenobi.ai</a>). Kenobi lets you add AI-based content personalization to any website. As a site owner, you install our personalization widget with a script tag, just like you would for e.g. a chatbot integration. As a visitor, you interact with the widget (right now by providing a company name) and Kenobi changes the site content to suit you.<p>We\u2019ve built a demo that anyone can try here: <a href=\"https://kenobi.ai/start\">https://kenobi.ai/start</a><p>We believe that large parts of the web are about to go from being static to dynamic because of how adept LLMs are at transforming rendered HTML. And right now we\u2019re focussing on B2B landing page content (as opposed to application UIs) because there is a lot of commercial opportunity for increasing top-of-funnel inbound conversions.<p>Our journey to Kenobi today is a long and snaking one. You may notice from the post title that we did YC\u2019s Winter 2022 batch (I know that 4 years is practically ancient in YC-dog-years). Kenobi is a hard pivot from our original idea that we got accepted into YC with \u2014 a company called Verdn which did trackable environmental donations via an API. Since the summer, we\u2019ve been hacking on different ideas\u2026 We started with personalized UI screenshots for outbound campaigns, but then people told us they wanted transformations to their actual site[0] \u2014 so we built an agentic workflow to research a visitor-company and \u201cpre-render\u201d changes to a landing site for them. Ultimately, there was too much friction in getting people to incorporate personalized URLs into their cold outbound campaigns[1]. Besides, people kept asking for us to do this for their inbound traffic, and so our current iteration was born.<p>Right now with Kenobi you pick a page that you\u2019d like to make customizable, and choose [text] elements that you\u2019d like to make dynamic. You can define custom prompting instructions for these elements, and when someone visits your page, our agentic workflow researches their company, and presents the updated content as quickly as possible, usually within a few seconds.[2] You also get a ping in Slack every time this happens so you know who is using your site.<p>We\u2019ve been experimenting with features such as generating custom imagery that actually looks good and native to the page design, and pulling in company data sources so that e.g. the right case study can be presented based on a visitor\u2019s industry and ICP profile.

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "Netrun Systems releases 10 Open Source interconnected Python packages for FastAPI",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>The Netrun Service Library is a collection of 10 MIT-licensed Python packages designed for FastAPI applications. Each package solves a common enterprise problem:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Package</th> <th>Function</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-auth</strong></td> <td>JWT authentication + Casbin RBAC + multi-tenant isolation</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-logging</strong></td> <td>Structlog-based logging with automatic redaction of passwords/tokens</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-config</strong></td> <td>Azure Key Vault integration with TTL caching and Pydantic Settings</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-errors</strong></td> <td>Exception hierarchy mapped to HTTP status codes with correlation IDs</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-cors</strong></td> <td>OWASP-compliant CORS middleware</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-db-pool</strong></td> <td>Async SQLAlchemy connection pooling with health checks</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-llm</strong></td> <td>Multi-provider LLM orchestration (Azure OpenAI, Ollama, Claude, Gemini)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-env</strong></td> <td>Schema-based environment variable validation CLI</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-pytest-fixtures</strong></td> <td>Unified test fixtures for all packages</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-ratelimit</strong></td> <td>Token bucket rate limiting with Redis backend</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The packages use a &quot;soft dependency&quot; pattern: they detect each other at runtime and integrate automatically. Install <code>netrun-logging</code> and all other packages use it for structured logging. Don't install it? They fall back to stdlib logging. This lets you use packages individually or as a cohesive ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>Quick example:</strong></p> <p>```python from netrun_auth import JWTAuthenticator, require_permission from netrun_logging import get_logger from netrun_config import AzureKeyVaultConfig</p> <p>logger = get<em>logger(</em><em>name</em>_) auth = JWTAuthenticator() config = AzureKeyVaultConfig()</p> <p>@app.get(&quot;/admin/users&quot;) @require_permission(&quot;users:read&quot;) async def list_users(user = Depends(auth.get_current_user)): logger.info(&quot;listing_users&quot;, user_id=user.id) return await get_users() ```</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>These packages are intended for <strong>production use</strong> in FastAPI applications, particularly:</p> <ul> <li>Developers building multi-tenant SaaS platforms</li> <li>Teams needing enterprise patterns (RBAC, audit logging, secrets management)</li> <li>Projects requiring multiple LLM provider support with fallback</li> <li>Anyone tired of writing the same auth/logging/config boilerplate</li> </ul> <p>I've been using them in production for internal enterprise platforms. They're stable and have 346+ passing tests across the library.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p><strong>vs. individual solutions (python-jose, structlog, etc.):</strong> These packages bundle best practices and wire everything together. Instead of configuring structlog manually, <code>netrun-logging</code> gives you sensible defaults with automatic sensitive field redaction. The soft dependency pattern means packages enhance each other when co-installed.</p> <p><strong>vs. FastAPI-Users:</strong> <code>netrun-auth</code> focuses on JWT + Casbin policy-based RBAC rather than database-backed user models. It's designed for services where user management lives elsewhere (Azure AD, Auth0, etc.) but you need fine-grained permission control.</p> <p><strong>vs. LangChain for LLM:</strong> <code>netrun-llm</code> is much lighter\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust provider abstraction and fallback logic. No chains, agents, or memory systems. If your provider is down, it fails over to the next one. That's it.</p> <p><strong>vs. writing it yourself:</strong> Each package represents patterns extracted from real production code. The auth package alone handles JWT validation, Casbin RBAC, multi-tenant isolation, and integrates with the logging package for audit trails.</p> <h2>Links</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Source Code</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/netrun-systems/netrun-oss\">https://github.com/netrun-systems/netrun-oss</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI</strong>: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/search/?q=netrun\">https://pypi.org/search/?q=netrun</a></li> <li><strong>Install</strong>: <code>pip install netrun-auth netrun-logging netrun-config</code></li> </ul> <h2>Feedback Welcome</h2> <ol> <li>Is the soft dependency pattern the right approach vs. hard dependencies?</li> <li>The LLM provider abstraction supports 5 providers with automatic fallback\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmissing any major ones?</li> <li>Edge cases in the auth package I should handle?</li> </ol> <p>MIT licensed.

Key architectural decisions:<p>1. Volatile Memory: The backend writes nothing to disk. Once a session terminates, the data is irretrievable.\n2. Client-Side Entropy: The password generator runs locally in the browser; keys are never sent to the server.\n3. PWA: It's installable and designed for low latency using WebSockets for incoming mail (no polling).\n4.

The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "content": "Prosopometamorphopsia (PMO) is a rare perceptual disorder characterized by facial distortions. This report presents the first thorough study of a case of PMO that emerged early in life. Zed, age 15 at the time of testing, has experienced lifelong, dynamic facial distortions in which features move, droop, disappear, expand, shrink, and rotate. He also experiences identity misrecognitions, in which he perceives familiar faces as strangers and vice versa (e.g., seeing his grandfather when viewing a young woman). Behavioral assessments indicate that Zed's distortions occur across viewpoints, visual field positions, picture-plane orientations, and visual angles. Neuropsychological testing revealed face identity recognition deficits, yet, despite his facial distortions, Zed can make accurate fine-grained perceptual judgments about facial age and sex. Structural MRI showed no lesions, but face-selectivity in two right posterior face-selective areas was reduced, and diffusion tensor imaging revealed lower white matter integrity in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Zed's case offers new insights into early-emerging PMO, its manifestations, co-occurrence with other face-processing disorders, and underlying neural correlates.",

    "content": "Everyday listening requires focusing on one talker while ignoring competing sounds, a process challenged by reverberation and unexpected distractions. Here, we asked whether reverberation decreases effects of distractions by reducing the salience of new onsets, or compounds disruption by increasing task difficulty. Across five online experiments, participants recalled spatialized syllable streams presented with or without interrupters under pseudo-anechoic and reverberant conditions. Interrupters consistently impaired recall, especially the syllables following the interrupter. For the syllable immediately after the interruption, this effect was larger in reverberation than in anechoic conditions. These results demonstrate that distractions are especially disruptive in reverberant settings.",

    "title": "Multi-timescale Rhythmic Dynamics in Rostral Ventromedial Medulla Neurons",
    "content": "Neural circuits involved in sensory control must integrate fast, reflexive responses with slower, state-dependent modulation. This coordination is especially critical in the pain system, where rapid withdrawal must be balanced against slower adjustments in nociceptive sensitivity that reflect arousal, physiology, and internal state. We hypothesized that neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), the principal brainstem node for descending pain control, operate across multiple temporal scales, combining fast stimulus-evoked responses with slower intrinsic dynamics. Using single-unit recordings from identified RVM ON-, OFF-, and NEUTRAL-cells and probabilistic modeling, we find that ON- and OFF-cells exhibit multi-phase population responses characterized by rapid activation and prolonged recovery dynamics lasting tens of seconds. In the absence of stimulation, the same neurons display coherent, quasi-periodic oscillations on the order of minutes, captured by Gaussian process models as predictable, low-frequency fluctuations. These rhythmic dynamics were specific to ON- and OFF-cells and occasionally coherent with autonomic parameters, suggesting coupling between nociceptive and homeostatic control loops. Together, these results identify a multi-timescale organizational principle within descending brainstem circuits, in which fast, reflex-related and slow, rhythmic processes jointly structure sensory modulation and internal state control.",

    "content": "Memory consolidation involves elusive neural mechanisms. Here, we develop a biophysically detailed model of the entorhinal-hippocampal-cortical network to reveal that disinhibition drives synaptic and systems consolidation. Transitioning to slow-wave sleep via neuromodulatory dampening of inhibition generates up-down states and spontaneous, time-compressed replays of spatial sequences encoded with theta-phase precession. Lateral inhibition levels unify physiological and pathological ripple diversity. Cortical disinhibition enables memory transfer from hippocampus. Weakened afferent CA1 synapses eliminate ripples but spare replays, proposing strategies to mitigate ripple disruptions. Replays sustain systems consolidation even without ripples, albeit slower; excessive weakening halts it, rescuable by enhanced hippocampal-to-cortical connectivity. Inducing disinhibition during wakefulness--mimicking medial-entorhinal-cortex-input-dependent quiet wakefulness replay--activates these processes, underscoring disinhibition's state-agnostic role. These insights elucidate disinhibition's centrality in engraining memories and fostering hippocampal independence, reconciling empirical observations, yielding testable predictions, and identifying therapeutic avenues for memory disorders.",

    "title": "Temporal contrast enhancement generalizes across pain and auditory modalities",
    "content": "The human brain continuously processes sensory inputs whose perceptual impact depends on stimulus intensity, salience, and context. Temporal filtering shapes this processing by dynamically modulating neural responses according to stimulus repetition, temporal structure, and predictive contingencies. Higher-order percepts such as pain are likewise a subject to temporal filtering, as exemplified by temporal contrast enhancement (TCE), a stimulation paradigm eliciting pain inhibition. However, given the prevalence of filtering mechanisms across sensory domains, it remains unclear whether TCE is specific to pain or represents a supramodal filtering mechanism. Here, we contrasted behavioral and neurophysiological responses, including electroencephalography and pupillometry, in a TCE paradigm for painful heat versus uncomfortable auditory stimulation. We sought to establish whether TCE generalizes across modalities and bases on similar or distinct underlying neurophysiological processes. Human participants took part in either a purely behavioral investigation (n = 33) or in a neurophysiological and behavioral investigation (n = 29). Both painful heat and loud sounds induced TCE effects, suggesting a supramodal temporal filtering mechanism with modality-specific temporal dynamics. Increasing pupil size and decreasing power of neural alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) with higher painful heat indicate bottom-up modulation of the autonomic nervous system and a release of neural inhibition, respectively. Critically, expectation of pain - but not loud sound - induced an alpha power increase, demonstrating to-down contributions to temporal filtering of pain. However, no direct neurophysiological correlates of subjectively experienced TCE effects were found. Findings suggests that a supramodal temporal filtering mechanism with modality-specific neurophysiological dynamics shapes the processing of aversive stimulation.",

    "title": "Neuronal activity induces myelin voltage changes that reflect action potential dependent myelin potassium buffering",
    "content": "Vertebrate axons can be wrapped by myelin produced by oligodendrocytes. This cellular interaction ensures fast and accurate propagation of action potentials, but the physiology of the myelin sheath is almost completely unknown. To investigate the physiology of the myelin sheath, we implemented an imaging strategy that allowed optical measurements of myelin membrane voltage, with the aim to identify physiological changes of the myelin membrane during neuronal firing. We expressed the genetically encoded voltage indicator ASAP3 in mouse oligodendrocytes in vivo and subsequently investigated myelin physiology by optically measuring myelin membrane voltage. We found that myelin depolarizes during neuronal activity, which is blocked by inhibiting neuronal action potentials. Pharmacological and knock-out experiments of Kir4.1 showed that potassium uptake channels mediate action potential induced depolarization. Blocking myelin dependent potassium uptake and direct application of high potassium to identified axons induced axonal initiated and antidromic propagating action potentials. Our study shows that myelin is not an electrically passive insulator, but exhibits ion dynamics and its physiological response is fine tuned to neuronal activity. By facilitating potassium removal during action potentials, myelin supports high precision axonal firing. Genetically encoded sensors are thus a useful tool to study physiological properties of myelin, inaccessible by classical techniques.",

    "title": "A map of the cortical functional network mediating naturalistic navigation",
    "content": "Navigation through the real world requires close coordination of perception, planning, and motor actions. Prior neuroimaging studies that used controlled stimuli and tasks have suggested that navigation-related information is represented broadly across the human cerebral cortex. While three regions in the anterior visual cortex have been well-studied, the extent and functional properties of regions in the parietal and prefrontal cortices are not as well-characterized. To map and characterize the full cortical network that underpins active navigation in the real world, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain activity from participants performing a naturalistic navigation task. Banded ridge regression was used to fit high-dimensional encoding models for 28,134 features to this data. Results show that naturalistic navigation is supported by a network of 11 functionally distinct cortical regions: five prefrontal and three parietal regions, along with three regions in the visual cortex that had been identified and characterized in previous studies. Analysis of encoding model weights shows that these 11 regions transform perceptual inputs through decision-making processes to produce action outputs, and are organized along distributed cortical functional gradients. These results provide a unified description of the functional properties and organization of the cortical network that mediates naturalistic navigation. We anticipate that these maps will provide rich targets to inform more targeted future studies of human navigation.",

    "content": "Precision neuroimaging was used to explore specialization for verbal versus nonverbal processing. Consistent with prior findings, individuals exhibited a spatially left-lateralized association language network, with regions in both hemispheres robustly responding to processing of meaning-based sentences. We next examined differential responses to verbal (words) versus nonverbal (faces) materials within the same working memory task. The right hemisphere components of the language network responded more strongly to nonverbal than to verbal materials, splitting the network's functional profile between the hemispheres. Similar patterns were observed across multiple association networks including putative cognitive-control, action-mode, and attention networks. The hemispheric laterality effect was prospectively replicated in a second independent study. These findings highlight a generalized laterality phenomenon that transcends individual specialized networks and aligns with a broad mechanism that modulates processing between the hemispheres.",

Single-cell atlases open unprecedented opportunities to survey cell physiological molecular states as the brain develops. However, technical challenges limit their potential. We present NeuRoDev, a computational resource with highly curated transcriptomic data and novel analytical tools to investigate neuronal and glial development in the human cortex. NeuRoDev compresses ~1M single-cell transcriptomes into integrative summary networks of reproducible cell clusters that capture temporal and cellular variation across all stages of human brain development. It provides a reference framework to directly interrogate cellular maturation dynamics, contextualize gene function, and interpret experimental organoid models. We use NeuRoDev to investigate developmental variation in cell physiology, reconstruct genesis and maturation dynamics in neuronal and glial cells, and interpret time-series data from organoid models. NeuRoDev is provided as a freely available software package and as web applications for interactive data analysis.",

    "title": "Bidirectional Crosstalk Between the SAGA Complex Deubiquitinase Module and the Molecular Circadian Clock",
    "content": "The Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex is a highly conserved chromatin-modifying transcriptional coactivator that regulates gene expression through both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. In addition to histone acetyltransferase activity, SAGA harbors a deubiquitinase module (DUBm) that influences protein stability, localization, and function by removal of ubiquitin. Although SAGAs roles in transcription are well characterized, how its enzymatic modules are dynamically regulated to coordinate its divergent activities remains less known. Here, we identify a bidirectional relationship between the molecular circadian clock and the SAGA DUBm. Our results indicate that circadian rhythms influence DUBm activities and expression, while the DUBm in turn shapes the timing and stability of core clock proteins and transcripts, positioning the DUBm as an important mediator of the molecular circadian clock.",

    "title": "Connectome Similarity Varies with Global Metastability and Movie Content",
    "content": "Introduction: Recent evidence supports that non-linear segments of brain activity carries most of the individual-specific information which allows unique identification based on functional connectomes (e.g. connectome fingerprints) in MEG. In fMRI, metastability has emerged as a reliable and robust summary measure of brain dynamics. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that metastability is associated with connectome fingerprinting in naturalistic fMRI. We further examined whether this putative association varies with time scales, across brain functional networks, and depending on the movie content. Methods: We analyzed fMRI data from 86 participants of the Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database. Data was collected during movie-watching of 10 entire movies of different genres. Global and network-level metastability were calculated using an fMRI-appropriate proxy measure based on the variability of spatial coherence. The within-subject stability (Iself) and between-subjects similarity (Iothers) of individual functional connectomes were also calculated. Linear mixed-effects models and appropriate contrasts were used to test associations between metastability and fingerprinting indices. Results: At the whole-brain level and considering data from all movies, an association across windows was found between metastability, Iself, and Iothers, with stronger effects observed for larger windows, such as the 600-second window (Iself: b = -0.13, SE = 0.032, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.23, SE = 0.028, p < 0.001). Associations were also observed with distinct magnitudes within the eight large-scale functional networks, with particularly strong effects in the Motor Network (Iself: b = -0.34, SE = 0.027, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.27, SE = 0.021, p < 0.001). Although no whole-brain differences were observed, movie content exhibited distinct association patterns within networks, notably for the prediction of Iself in the Visual Network for 500 Days of Summer ({Delta} = -0.22, SE = 0.11, p = 0.043). For Iothers, significant between-movie differences were found in the AMN ({Delta} = -0.25, SE = 0.062, p < 0.001), Dorsal Attention ({Delta} = 0.16, SE = 0.08, p = 0.038), Ventral Attention ({Delta} = 0.14, SE = 0.060, p = 0.017), and Visual Networks ({Delta} = -0.17, SE = 0.081, p = 0.031). Conclusion: Metastability is systematically related to functional connectome fingerprints. This relationship is time-scale dependent, varies across functional networks, and is sensitive to movie content. Our findings bridge nonlinear brain dynamics and connectome identifiability, highlighting naturalistic paradigms as a powerful framework for individualized precision neuroimaging.",

    "title": "Gasdermin E couples mitochondrial damage to pyroptotic neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease",
    "content": "Parkinson disease (PD) features progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, but how mitochondrial damage engages programmed cell death pathways remains unresolved. Here, we identify gasdermin E (GSDME), the caspase-3-activated executor of pyroptosis, as a critical mediator of neurodegeneration in toxin-based PD models. In primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells, the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor MPTP/MPP triggered caspase-3 activation, GSDME cleavage, and lytic membrane rupture. Genetic silencing of Gsdme or its transcriptional regulator SP1 reduced neuronal death. In vivo, Gsdme deficiency preserved substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons, improved motor performance, and mitigated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors after MPTP administration. Loss of Gsdme also dampened microglial and astrocytic activation and lowered proinflammatory cytokines in striatum and substantia nigra. Mechanistically, cleaved GSDME localized to mitochondria, disrupted membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species, and precipitated organelle injury, thereby coupling mitochondrial dysfunction to pyroptotic cell death. These findings identify GSDME-mediated pyroptosis as a mechanistic link between mitochondrial toxicity and neuroinflammation in PD and nominate GSDME as a therapeutic entry point to slow disease progression.",

    "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
    "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

    "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
    "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

    "content": "IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a chronic and debilitating element of major depressive disorder (MDD), which manifests as abnormal processing in hot (emotion-laden) and cold (emotion-independent) cognitive systems. Although the antidepressant properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are well-established, its impact on hot and cold cognition requires further elucidation.MethodsProspective study of patients with MDD undergoing an acute course of high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). MDD patients (N\u202f=\u202f24) received a 4-to-6-week course of rTMS during which they were evaluated for depressive symptoms and completed cognitive assessments. Age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f33) also completed the cognitive tasks at the same intervals as the MDD patients.ResultsSustained antidepressant effect was observed following rTMS in MDD patients. Hot and cold cognition remained unaltered over the course of treatment. A pre-treatment baseline cognitive phenotype of those who achieve remission of their depressive symptoms with rTMS was identified, characterized by greater sustained attention, speed in correct identification of facial expressions, and free recall of words.ConclusionOur findings further validate the cognitive safety and clinical efficacy of rTMS as an intervention for MDD. Future research is required to further characterize the utility of pre-rTMS cognitive phenotyping in identified remitters, to aid in patient selection and treatment prognostication.",

    "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

Studies on deep brain stimulation, corticocortical paired associative stimulation, sequential stimulation, case reports, and reviews were excluded.ResultsOf the 1,453 initial records, 14 met the inclusion criteria. The studies predominantly employed transcranial direct current stimulation/transcranial alternating current stimulation, targeting the frontoparietal network. Neurophysiological data from electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed network-level modulations. Behavioral outcomes were inconsistent, with some studies reporting improvements in executive function, working memory, and response inhibition, whereas others showed no significant advantages over sham stimulation.ConclusionAlthough multifocal tES is a promising modality, clearly determining its efficacy is currently limited by heterogeneous study designs, small sample sizes, and conflicting findings. Future research should prioritize multi-arm trials, incorporate neurophysiological biomarkers, and develop personalized stimulation protocols to optimize the effectiveness of this technique.Trial registrationPROSPERO Registration # CRD420250646196.",

    "content": "IntroductionWidespread visual deficits accompany normal aging, with most attributed to functional degradation of the visual cortex. Although perceptual learning can improve many visual functions in older adults, it remains unclear whether it can enhance spatial contrast sensitivity, a fundamental visual function known to decline significantly from around age forty.MethodsTo address this, we trained 29 older adults and 18 young controls using contrast perceptual learning. Training was conducted at seven spatial frequencies (from low to high) and/or at the individual cut-off spatial frequency. Spatial contrast sensitivity function (SCSF) and visual acuity (VA) were measured before and after training.ResultsTraining induced substantial improvements in both SCSF and VA in older adults, which were retained for at least several months. Analysis of transfer effects revealed that, compared to young controls, older adults exhibited a characteristic low-frequency shift in peak improvement and a slightly broader bandwidth.DiscussionThese results may be associated with age-related alterations in neuronal response properties within the primary visual cortex. Our findings demonstrate substantial neural plasticity in the aging visual system and support the potential of perceptual learning as a clinically viable intervention for mitigating age-related visual decline.",

    "title": "Contribution of binocular visual function and its impairment by Bangerter foils to the performance of a precision reaching, grasping and placing task in healthy adults",
    "content": "BackgroundUpper limb movement execution is affected in patients with vision impairments resulting from ocular pathologies or binocular anomalies. Deficits in motor performance have been correlated with reduced contrast sensitivity, phoria, and stereoacuity.AimTo evaluate the effects of increased straylight induced by Bangerter foils on binocular visual function and examine the corresponding impact on eye-hand kinematics during a high precision reaching, grasping and placement task (i.e., bead threading).MethodsTwenty-one healthy participants, aged 21\u201341\u202fyears, participated in this experimental study. Visual function assessment included visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), stereoacuity (SA), phoria, and fusional vergences (FV). Vision was impaired experimentally using Bangerter foils 0.4. Participants performed a bead threading task under three randomized viewing conditions: binocular baseline (BB; normal vision), binocular viewing with a foil over the dominant eye (FDE), and foils over both eyes (FBE). Eye and hand movements were recorded using an eye tracker and a motion capture camera.ResultsVisual functions (VA, CS, and stereoacuity) were impaired when viewing with the Bangerter foils. Pairwise comparison between viewing conditions confirmed statistically significant differences between BB, FDE and FBE for mid to high spatial frequencies (6, 12 and 18\u202fcycles per degree; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Break points for positive and negative fusional reserves were impaired when interocular differences increased (i.e., FDE condition). The impairment did not have any impact on phoria. Results from the kinematic analysis revealed threading duration was prolonged using Bangerter foils on both eyes (FBE condition). In contrast to the hypothesis, visual deficit due to foils did not affect any other kinematic measures. However, results from mixed model analyses revealed that individual differences in phoria and fusional vergence had the most significant influence on reaching performance. Specifically, a larger exophoria magnitude was associated with longer reach duration, lower peak velocity and prolonged total time to complete the task (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionInducing short-term deterioration through the alteration of contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequencies without a clinical deterioration in stereopsis does not have a significant impact on precision grasping and placing movements, in a repetitive manual task. Notably, this study demonstrated that phoria impacts the execution of reaching movements.",

    "content": "IntroductionCochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices designed to restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. Clinically, CI electrode arrays differ by location, either peri-modiolar (pm) positioned near the cochlear axis, or lateral-wall (lw), placed closer to the peripheral terminals of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Standard insertion is into the scala tympani (ST), though the scala vestibuli (SV) is considered for cases of severe ST ossification.MethodsThis computational study investigates the neural responses of both healthy and degenerated ANFs to monopolar stimulation from electrode arrays at different locations. Using a 3D finite element model of the human cochlea, we evaluated threshold excitations for short monophasic pulses across 25 traced ANF pathways. Four array configurations were compared (pmST, pmSV, lwST, lwSV), each with electrodes directly targeting the traced fibers.ResultsResults show that excitation thresholds and stimulation specificity depend on both neural health and array position. Specificity, defined by minimizing off-target fiber stimulation, was highest for healthy ANFs with lwSV, followed by pmST, lwST, and pmSV, influenced by electrode orientation. Simulated ST ossification, modeled as decreased conductivity, generally led to reduced cathodic thresholds, suggesting that ST insertion may still be advantageous even with developing or partial ossification.DiscussionThe pmST array consistently offered reliable outcomes across varying electrode configuration and neural conditions. These findings support considering SV insertion when ST is obstructed and highlight factors influencing CI performance based on array location and neural status.",

    "content": "BackgroundParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that poses a significant mental and physical burden on patients, markedly diminishing their quality of life. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive functions, mood state, sleep function, and overal quality of life in individuals with PD.MethodsRelevant literature was sourced from multiple databases, ultimately including 22 studies with a total of 1324 individuals. Data analysis was conducted using meta-analysis software. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024599943).ResultsThe findings indicated that tDCS significantly enhanced cognitive function, alleviated anxiety and depression, increased sleep duration, improved sleep efficiency, reduced arousal index, and ameliorated daytime sleepiness, while also enhancing activities of daily living. However, discrepancies were noted across various assessment scales, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Cognitive Rating Scale, delayed recall metrics, sleep scales, and Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire. Additionally, individuals with PD displayed good tolerance to tDCS.ConclusionOverall, tDCS shows promise in improving non-motor symptoms and enhancing quality of life for individuals with PD.

    "title": "Regional abnormalities in the hippocampus and verbal memory impairment in craniofacial dystonia",
    "content": "BackgroundPatients with craniofacial dystonia (CFD) often present with verbal memory deficits, but their neuroanatomical basis is not yet clear. This study aims to determine whether verbal memory deficits in CFD are associated with structural atrophy of specific hippocampal subfields, and to isolate dystonia-specific pathological changes through comparison with patients with hemifacial spasm (HFS).MethodsWe recruited 50 patients with CFD, 48 patients with HFS, and 50 healthy controls (HCs). Verbal memory and global cognitive function were assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. Volumes of hippocampal subfields were quantified from high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using FreeSurfer. Group comparisons were performed after controlling for relevant covariates.ResultsWhile global cognition (MMSE) scores did not differ significantly among groups, patients with CFD demonstrated significant verbal memory deficits. Compared with HCs, they performed worse across immediate, short-, and long-delay recall trials, with medium-to-large effect sizes (all P-FDR \u2264 0.002; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.70 to \u22120.82). Similar deficits of medium effect sizes were observed when compared with patients with HFS (all P-FDR \u2264 0.027; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.49 to \u22120.52). Crucially, patients with HFS were unimpaired relative to HCs, establishing this memory deficit as specific to the dystonia pathophysiology. The imaging analysis revealed that patients with CFD were associated with significant atrophy in the left granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-DG) (P-FDR = 0.014; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.58) and CA4 (P-FDR = 0.010; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.60) compared with HCs, and with significant atrophy in the right GC-DG (P-FDR = 0.032; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.52) and CA4 (P-FDR = 0.041; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.50) compared with HCs. However, the magnitude of the atrophy showed no significant correlation with verbal memory scores, disease duration, or motor severity, revealing a critical structure-function dissociation.ConclusionOur findings reveal a structure-function dissociation in CFD. We propose its verbal memory deficits, despite hippocampal atrophy, may stem from broader network dysfunction or microstructural pathology not seen on conventional MRI. This challenges models assuming a direct link between macrostructural atrophy and cognitive symptoms.",

    "content": "Hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, and tooth enamel defects syndrome (HADDTS) is a recently identified disorder linked to a heterozygous mutation in the C-terminal Binding Protein 1 (CTBP1) transcriptional corepressor. The predominant mutation (p.R342W) is located within the major protein binding cleft (PXDLS), crucial for CtBP1\u2019s interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. To investigate the mutation\u2019s functional consequences, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent cell lines (iPSCs) carrying the CTBP1 mutation in heterozygous and homozygous conditions using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing method. The transcriptional profile of iPSC-derived early neurons from the isogenic wild type and CTBP1 heterozygous and homozygous mutants was determined by genome-wide RNA sequencing. The RNA-Seq data revealed downregulation of several key transcription factors, with homozygous mutations causing more pronounced downregulation compared to heterozygous mutations. Isogenic mutant neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibited reduced adhesion and migration, along with dysregulated calcium signaling, while mutant neurons showed premature neurite outgrowth. Together, our transcriptomic and biological results provide novel insights into the role and mechanism of CTBP1 p.R342W mutation in the defective neurodevelopmental processes.",

    "content": "Human patients with somatosensory loss often experience severe motor deficits, causing profound challenges to independently accomplish typical tasks of daily life. Brain\u2013machine Interfaces (BMIs) offer the potential to restore lost functionality through direct electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex via intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS). By modulating temporal patterns of stimulation, our group has previously shown single-channel ICMS can evoke both naturalistic cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory feedback. However, accurate modulation of the sensory feedback\u2019s qualia (somatotopic location, intensity and description) will be critical for fluid, dexterous motor control. In nonhuman primate studies, multi-channel ICMS has shown promise in improving quantifiable metrics such as reaction time. In recent human work, multi-channel ICMS has improved discrimination performance; however, evoked qualia from multi-channel ICMS has not been well characterized. We hypothesized multi-channel ICMS could evoke unique qualia compared to single-channel. A human participant with tetraplegia and chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in primary somatosensory cortex, reported perceptual thresholds, sensation descriptions, intensity and somatotopic locations of single- and multi-channel ICMS patterns. We found multi-channel ICMS patterns evoked unique qualia compared to single-channel ICMS. To investigate the role of charge in producing these unique evoked sensory percepts, we delivered equal amounts of charge with differing spatial patterns across multiple electrodes. Multi-channel ICMS substantially reduced the minimum stimulation amplitude required to evoked somatosensations, lowering the charge per electrode detection threshold, while increasing the total charge injected. Delivered charge across multiple electrodes, positively modulated the sensation\u2019s perceived intensity; providing early evidence of spatial integration of ICMS in the target network. Multi-channel ICMS resulted in more frequent verbal reports of \u2018natural\u2019 sensation descriptors (100% vs 85% for single-channel ICMS, p-val < 0.05) and robustly evoked sensations with high repeatability in stable somatotopic locations. Multi-channel ICMS patterns demonstrated improvements in reliability, somatotopic coverage and \u2018natural-ness\u2019 of the evoked sensations, marking significant advances towards state-of-the-art somatosensory BMIs. By better understanding of the input/output relationship for somatosensory feedback BMIs, we can expect to improve movement accuracy and increase embodiment for human users.",

    "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
    "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

    "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
    "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

    "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.13871v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This thesis presents a fundamental rethink of electricity market design at the wholesale and balancing layers. Rather than treating markets as static spot clearing mechanisms, it reframes them as a continuously online, event driven dynamical control system: a two sided marketplace operating directly on grid physics.\n  Existing energy only, capacity augmented, and zonal market designs are shown to admit no shock robust Nash equilibrium under realistic uncertainty, instead relying on price caps, uplift, and regulatory intervention to preserve solvency and security. In response, the thesis develops a holarchic Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in which prices are bounded, exogenous control signals derived from physical tightness rather than emergent equilibrium outcomes.\n  The AMM generalises nodal and zonal pricing through nested scarcity layers, from node to cluster to zone to region to system, such that participant facing prices inherit from the tightest binding constraint. Nodal and zonal pricing therefore emerge as special cases of a unified scarcity propagation rule.\n  Beyond pricing, the AMM functions as a scarcity aware control system and a digitally enforceable rulebook for fair access and proportional allocation under shortage. Fuel costs are recovered through pay as bid energy dispatch consistent with merit order, while non fuel operating and capital costs are allocated according to adequacy, flexibility, and locational contribution.\n  Large scale simulations demonstrate bounded input bounded output stability, controllable procurement costs, zero structural waste, and improved distributional outcomes. The architecture is climate aligned and policy configurable, but requires a managed transition and new operational tools for system operators and market participants.",

    "title": "EEG-D3: A Solution to the Hidden Overfitting Problem of Deep Learning Models",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.13806v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Deep learning for decoding EEG signals has gained traction, with many claims to state-of-the-art accuracy. However, despite the convincing benchmark performance, successful translation to real applications is limited. The frequent disconnect between performance on controlled BCI benchmarks and its lack of generalisation to practical settings indicates hidden overfitting problems. We introduce Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method for training deep learning models across EEG datasets. By predicting the place in the respective trial sequence from which the input window was sampled, EEG-D3 separates latent components of brain activity, akin to non-linear ICA. We utilise a novel model architecture with fully independent sub-networks for strict interpretability. We outline a feature interpretation paradigm to contrast the component activation profiles on different datasets and inspect the associated temporal and spatial filters. The proposed method reliably separates latent components of brain activity on motor imagery data. Training downstream classifiers on an appropriate subset of these components prevents hidden overfitting caused by task-correlated artefacts, which severely affects end-to-end classifiers. We further exploit the linearly separable latent space for effective few-shot learning on sleep stage classification. The ability to distinguish genuine components of brain activity from spurious features results in models that avoid the hidden overfitting problem and generalise well to real-world applications, while requiring only minimal labelled data. With interest to the neuroscience community, the proposed method gives researchers a tool to separate individual brain processes and potentially even uncover heretofore unknown dynamics.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.13768v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Major AI ethics guidelines and laws, including the EU AI Act, call for effective human oversight, but do not define it as a distinct and developable capacity. This paper introduces human oversight as a well-being capacity, situated within the emerging Well-being Efficacy framework. The concept integrates AI literacy, ethical discernment, and awareness of human needs, acknowledging that some needs may be conflicting or harmful. Because people inevitably project desires, fears, and interests into AI systems, oversight requires the competence to examine and, when necessary, restrain problematic demands.\n  The authors argue that the sustainable and cost-effective development of this capacity depends on its integration into education at every level, from professional training to lifelong learning. The frame of human oversight as a well-being capacity provides a practical path from high-level regulatory goals to the continuous cultivation of human agency and responsibility essential for safe and ethical AI. The paper establishes a theoretical foundation for future research on the pedagogical implementation and empirical validation of well-being effectiveness in multiple contexts.",

We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction. In a single 86-turn dialogue session, the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, yielding a consistent asymmetry between NP and FR across domains. Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts. Overall, the study proposes an interaction-level auditing framework based on observable behavior and motivates LI as a lens for examining potential alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across users and models.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.14641v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We conducted a qualitative co-design study with four adults aged 60+ to gather design insights on a Figma prototype and a generative AI (GenAI) chatbot for an app aimed at providing an AI coach to support older adults' physical activity. The initial design for both incorporates several novel aspects: a curated health knowledge base, personalised responses based on goals and health history, privacy considerations, integration with wearables for physical activity context, as well as dynamic context injection. The study yielded feedback on improving both the proposed user experience in the app and the conversation flow with the chatbot, and it will aid future work aimed at implementing a GenAI-powered health coach for older adults.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.14278v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial Intelligence tools such as large language models are increasingly used by the public to obtain health information and guidance. In health-related contexts, following or rejecting AI-generated advice can have direct clinical implications. Existing instruments like the Trust in Automated Systems Survey assess trustworthiness of generic technology, and no validated instrument measures users' trust in AI-generated health advice specifically. This study developed and validated the Trust in AI-Generated Health Advice (TAIGHA) scale and its four-item short form (TAIGHA-S) as theory-based instruments measuring trust and distrust, each with cognitive and affective components. The items were developed using a generative AI approach, followed by content validation with 10 domain experts, face validation with 30 lay participants, and psychometric validation with 385 UK participants who received AI-generated advice in a symptom-assessment scenario. After automated item reduction, 28 items were retained and reduced to 10 based on expert ratings. TAIGHA showed excellent content validity (S-CVI/Ave=0.99) and CFA confirmed a two-factor model with excellent fit (CFI=0.98, TLI=0.98, RMSEA=0.07, SRMR=0.03). Internal consistency was high ({\\alpha}=0.95). Convergent validity was supported by correlations with the Trust in Automated Systems Survey (r=0.67/-0.66) and users' reliance on the AI's advice (r=0.37 for trust), while divergent validity was supported by low correlations with reading flow and mental load (all |r|<0.25). TAIGHA-S correlated highly with the full scale (r=0.96) and showed good reliability ({\\alpha}=0.88). TAIGHA and TAIGHA-S are validated instruments for assessing user trust and distrust in AI-generated health advice. Reporting trust and distrust separately permits a more complete evaluation of AI interventions, and the short scale is well-suited for time-constrained settings.",

However, using optimization solvers is difficult for end users because it requires problem instantiation: defining candidate items, assigning preference scores, and specifying constraints. We introduce LAPPI (LLM-Assisted Preference-based Problem Instantiation), an interactive approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to support users in this instantiation process. Through natural language conversations, the system helps users transform vague preferences into well-defined optimization problems. These instantiated problems are then passed to existing optimization solvers to generate solutions. In a user study on trip planning, our method successfully captured user preferences and generated feasible plans that outperformed both conventional and prompt-engineering approaches. We further demonstrate LAPPI's versatility by adapting it to an additional use case.",

Most research has focused on juicy particle effects. However, text effects are also commonly used in games, albeit not always juiced up. One type is onomatopoeia, a well-defined element of human language that has been translated to visual media, such as comic books and games. Another is semantic text, often used to provide performance feedback in games. In this work, we explored the relationship between juiciness and text effects, aiming to replicate juicy user experiences with text-based juice and combining particle and text juice. We show in a multi-phase within-subjects experiment that users rate juicy text effects similarly to particles effects, with comparable performance, and more reliable feedback. We also hint at potential improvement in user experience when both are combined, and how text stimuli may be perceived differently than other visual ones. We contribute empirical findings on the juicy-text connection in the context of visual effects for interactive media.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.13694v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: For decades, car following and traffic flow models have assumed that drivers default driving strategy is to maintain a safe distance. Several previous studies have questioned whether the Driving to Keep Distance is a traffic invariant. Therefore, the acceleration deceleration torque asymmetry of drivers must necessarily determine the observed patterns of traffic oscillations. Those studies indicate that drivers can adopt alternative CF strategies, such as Driving to Keep Inertia, by following basic instructions. The present work extends the evidence from previous research by showing the effectiveness of a DI course that immediately translates into practice on a closed circuit. Twelve drivers were invited to follow a lead car that varied its speed on a real circuit. Then, the driver took a DI course and returned to the same real car following scenario. Drivers generally adopted DD as the default CF mode in the pretest, both in field and simulated PC conditions, yielding very similar results. After taking the full DI course, drivers showed significantly less acceleration, deceleration, and speed variability than did the pretest, both in the field and in the simulated conditions, which indicates that drivers adopted the DI strategy. This study is the first to show the potential of adopting a DI strategy in a real circuit.",

This paper presents an analysis of designing a software application focused on Enhanced Telehealth Capabilities (ETHC) for palliative care, integrating across three socio-technical dimensions: quality, human values, and real-world. Designing for quality attributes -- such as performance, maintainability, safety, and security -- ensured that the system is technically robust and compliant with clinical standards. Designing for human values -- empathy, inclusivity, accessibility, and transparency -- helped enhance patient experience, trust, and ethical alignment. Designing for real-world -- through a multidisciplinary, experience-based co-design approach involving clinicians, patients, and carers that guided iterative cycles of prototyping, usability testing, and real-world evaluation -- ensured continuous refinement of features and alignment with clinical practice. The resulting telehealth software solution demonstrated that our socio-technical design framework was successful in producing a secure, equitable, and resilient digital health application. Our design approach can assist others designing software in health and other domains.",

    "content": "arXiv:2505.16861v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Computational neuroscience has traditionally focused on isolated scales, limiting understanding of brain function across multiple levels. While microscopic models capture biophysical details of neurons, macroscopic models describe large-scale network dynamics. Integrating these scales, however, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a novel co-simulation framework that bridges these levels by integrating the neural simulator Arbor with The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform. Arbor enables detailed simulations from single-compartment neurons to populations of such cells, while TVB models whole-brain dynamics based on anatomical features and the mean neural activity of a brain region. By linking these simulators for the first time, we provide an example of how to model and investigate the onset of seizures in specific areas and their propagation to the whole brain. This framework employs an MPI intercommunicator for real-time bidirectional interaction, translating between discrete spikes from Arbor and continuous TVB activity. Its fully modular design enables independent model selection for each scale, requiring minimal effort to translate activity across simulators. The novel Arbor-TVB co-simulator allows replacement of TVB nodes with biologically realistic neuron populations, offering insights into seizure propagation and potential intervention strategies. The integration of Arbor and TVB marks a significant advancement in multi-scale modeling, providing a comprehensive computational framework for studying neural disorders and optimizing treatments.",

We present PROTON, a heterogeneous graph transformer that generates testable hypotheses across molecular, organoid, and clinical systems. To evaluate PROTON, we apply it to Parkinson's disease (PD), bipolar disorder (BD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD, PROTON linked genetic risk loci to genes essential for dopaminergic neuron survival and predicted pesticides toxic to patient-derived neurons, including the insecticide endosulfan, which ranked within the top 1.29% of predictions. In silico screens performed by PROTON reproduced six genome-wide $\\alpha$-synuclein experiments, including a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system (normalized enrichment score [NES] = 2.30, FDR-adjusted $p < 1 \\times 10^{-4}$), an ascorbate peroxidase proximity labeling assay (NES = 2.16, FDR $< 1 \\times 10^{-4}$), and a high-depth targeted exome sequencing study in 496 synucleinopathy patients (NES = 2.13, FDR $< 1 \\times 10^{-4}$). In BD, PROTON predicted calcitriol as a candidate drug that reversed proteomic alterations observed in cortical organoids derived from BD patients. In AD, we evaluated PROTON predictions in health records from $n = 610,524$ patients at Mass General Brigham, confirming that five PROTON-predicted drugs were associated with reduced seven-year dementia risk (minimum hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53-0.75, $p < 1 \\times 10^{-7}$).

    "content": "arXiv:2512.14359v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: For decades, focal non-invasive neuromodulation of deep brain regions has not been possible because of the steep depth-focality trade-off of conventional non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or classical transcranial electric stimulation (tES). Deep brain stimulation has therefore largely relied on invasive approaches in clinical populations, requiring surgery. Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a promising method to overcome this challenge and allows for the first time focal non-invasive electrical deep brain stimulation. The method, which was first validated through computational modeling and rodent work, has now been successfully translated to humans to target deep brain regions such as the hippocampus or striatum. In this Perspective, we present current evidence for tTIS-based neuromodulation, underlying mechanisms and discuss future developments of this promising technology. More specifically, we highlight key opportunities and challenges for fundamental neuroscience as well as for the design of new interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. We also discuss the status of understanding and challenges regarding the basic mechanisms of action of tTIS and possible lines of technological innovation to optimize stimulation, in particular in terms of intensity and focality. Overall, we suggest that following the first proof-of-concepts, an important multidisciplinary research effort is now required to further validate the use of tTIS in multiple applications, understand its underlying principles and optimize the technology in the view of a wider scientific and clinical deployment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.14160v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Objectives. Accurately predicting transitions to anesthetic drugs overdosage is a critical challenge in general anesthesia as it requires the identification of EEG indicators relevant for anticipating the evolution of the depth of anesthesia. Methods. In this study, we introduce a real-time, data-driven framework based on alpha spindle dynamics extracted from frontal EEG recordings. Using Empirical Mode Decomposition, we segment transient alpha spindle events and extract statistical features such as amplitude, duration, frequency, and suppression intervals. We apply these features to train a Light Gradient Boosting Machine, LGBM, classifier on a clinical EEG dataset spanning induction, maintenance, and emergence phases of general anesthesia. Results. Our model accurately classifies anesthesia phases with over 80 percent accuracy and anticipates the onset of isoelectric suppression, a marker of anesthetic drugs overdosage, with 96 percent accuracy up to 90 seconds in advance. Conclusion. The spindle-based metrics provides a non-invasive, interpretable, and predictive approach. This real-time method can be used to forecast unintentional anesthetic drugs overdosage, enabling proactive anesthesia management based solely on EEG signals. Significance. This new method is the first to provide a way to prevent too deep anesthesia and its consequence for the well-being of patients after the recovery from anesthesia.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.13859v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Classical autoassociative memory models have been central to understanding emergent computations in recurrent neural circuits across diverse biological contexts. However, they typically neglect neuromodulatory agents that are known to strongly shape memory capacity and stability. Here we introduce a minimal, biophysically motivated associative memory network where neuropeptide-like signals are modeled by a self-adaptive, activity-dependent gating mechanism. Using many-body simulations and dynamical mean-field theory, we show that such gating fundamentally reorganizes the attractor structure: the network bypasses the classical spin-glass transition, maintaining robust, high-overlap retrieval far beyond the standard critical capacity, without shrinking basins of attraction. Mechanistically, the gate stabilizes transient ghost remnants of stored patterns even far above the Hopfield limit, converting them into multistable attractors. These results demonstrate that neuromodulation-like gating alone can dramatically enhance associative memory capacity, eliminate the sharp Hopfield-style catastrophic breakdown, and reshape the memory landscape, providing a simple, general route to richer memory dynamics and computational capabilities in neuromodulated circuits and neuromorphic architectures.",

    "content": "Alcohol use is a major global health concern, particularly during adolescence, a developmental period characterized by heightened impulsivity, a known risk factor for alcohol misuse. The insular cortex is critically involved in interoceptive processing and impulsivity regulation, and its activity is powerfully shaped by parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons. We hypothesized that developmental differences in PV interneuron activity within the insular cortex contribute to impulsivity-related behaviors and alcohol consumption. To investigate this, male C57BL/6 mice were assessed at two developmental stages: adolescence (postnatal day 28) and young adulthood (postnatal day 64). Impulsivity was measured using the Omission-Contingency Learning (OCL) task, while alcohol intake and preference were evaluated using a two-bottle choice paradigm. Adolescent mice displayed higher impulsivity and greater alcohol consumption than adults. Double immunofluorescence labeling (Fos+/NeuN+ and Fos+/PV+) showed that increased impulsivity was associated with reduced activation of PV interneurons in the insular cortex. Chemogenetic activation of PV interneurons in adult PV-Cre mice reduced impulsivity in the OCL task and decreased alcohol intake. These findings indicate that insular PV interneurons play a modulatory role in impulsive behavior and alcohol consumption, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for impulse-control and alcohol-use disorders.",

    "title": "Ultrastructure of Inputs to the Granule Cell Domain of the Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus",
    "content": "The granule cell domain of the cochlear nucleus (GCD) receives input from multimodal brain regions including the second cervical spinal ganglion, the spinal trigeminal nucleus, the cuneate nucleus, and the lateral reticular nucleus. Most of the input are in the form of large mossy fibers and small boutons containing round synaptic vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses. A smaller number of inputs arise from the lateral reticular nucleus and the spinal trigeminal nucleus that contain pleomorphic synaptic vesicles implying inhibitory action. This circumstance positions the GCD for integrating polysensory excitatory and inhibitory inputs at the earliest stages of auditory processing, which suggests a role for segregating sound streams. The structural substrate for such a function is naturally elaborate. Mossy fibers from these different origins are large, multilobed endings that form synaptic glomeruli with postsynaptic targets that include granule cells, unipolar brush cells, cartwheel cells, and chestnut cells, which in turn project to principal cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Numerous synapses contribute to the integration of the different modalities, but the organization of these synapses is still not well understood. We investigated this issue by labelling the presynaptic endings of different somatosensory inputs using biotinylated dextran amine or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, and studying their post-synaptic relationships in the GCD. The anterogradely-labeled endings and associated targets were visualized by light and electron microscopy. Following computer-aided, three-dimensional reconstructions, we found that unipolar brush cells are the main target of the C2 DRG and cuneate nucleus. Mossy fibers from the spinal trigeminal nucleus project to Golgi cells, an inhibitory neuron. In contrast, inhibitory boutons originated from the lateral reticular nucleus. These results reveal that somatosensory integration in the granule cell domain is achieved by distinctive synaptic wiring and specialized chemical signaling.",

    "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
    "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

    "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
    "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

    "title": "Connectomic mapping of pharyngeal and gut sensory circuits in adult Drosophila",
    "content": "Feeding is regulated by both external sensory signals, such as taste, and internal sensory signals originating from the pharynx and gut. The recent completion of the Full Adult Fly Brain (FAFB) connectome offers an opportunity to map these sensory inputs and their downstream circuits. While the external gustatory receptor neurons have been relatively well characterized, the internal pharyngeal and gut sensory neurons remain less understood. Here, we systemically identify their axonal projections in the FAFB connectome and examine their downstream circuits. We find that the stomodeal nerve, which carries afferent signals from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain, contains multiple types of sensory axons with distinct morphology and downstream output connections. In addition, we identify sensory axons derived from different pharyngeal sense organs and find that chemosensory and mechanosensory axons arborize in distinct regions of the subesophageal zone. Characterization of the second- and third-order neurons reveals the major brain regions that receive input from pharyngeal and gut sensory neurons. Interestingly, a subset of these internal sensory neurons forms monosynaptic connections with various motor neurons and endocrine cells, suggesting that internal signals from the pharynx and gut may directly influence feeding-related motor programs and endocrine output. Together, our study delineates the pharyngeal and gut sensory circuits, laying a foundation for future studies on how internal sensory signals regulate feeding behavior and endocrine functions.",

    "title": "Robust automated preclinical fMRI preprocessing via a multi-stage dilated convolutional Swin Transformer affine registration",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is crucial for effective analysis in preclinical studies. Key steps such as denoising, skull-stripping, and affine registration are essential to align fMRI data with a standard atlas. However, challenges such as low resolution, variations in brain geometry, and limited dataset sizes often hinder the performance of traditional and deep learning-based methods.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a preclinical fMRI preprocessing pipeline that integrates advanced deep learning modules, with a particular focus on a newly developed Swin Transformer-based affine registration method. The pipeline incorporates our previously established modules for 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based denoising and Transformer-based skull stripping, followed by the proposed Multi-stage Dilated Convolutional Swin Transformer (MsDCSwinT) for affine registration. This new registration method captures both local and global spatial misalignments, ensuring accurate alignment with a standard atlas even in challenging preclinical datasets.ResultsWe validate the pipeline across multiple preclinical fMRI studies and demonstrate that our affine registration module achieves higher average Dice similarity coefficients compared to state-of-the-art methods.DiscussionBy leveraging GANs and Transformers, our pipeline offers a robust, accurate, and fully automated solution for preclinical fMRI.",

    "title": "GAME-Net: an ensemble deep learning framework integrating Generative Autoencoders and attention mechanisms for automated brain tumor segmentation in MRI",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

    "title": "High-Fidelity Tuning of Olfactory Mixture Distances in the Perceptual Space of Smell Through a Community Effort",
    "content": "A central goal in sensory science is to establish quantitative mappings between physical stimuli and perceptual responses. While such mappings are well characterized in vision and audition, they remain poorly defined in olfaction, limiting progress toward understanding the representations of smell. Predicting perceptual similarity between odor mixtures offers a promising route to formalize these relationships. To advance this effort, the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) Olfactory Mixtures Prediction Challenge assembled a curated, cross-study dataset describing the similarity of 507 mixture pairs and an unpublished test set of 46 mixture pairs. Teams competed to predict the perceptual similarity of mixture pairs, and then collaborated post-challenge to create an ensemble combining top-performing models that notably improves predictions over the existing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, ensemble model maintains high predictive accuracy in novel validation set. Our model provides a reproducible framework for neuroscientists, chemists, and engineers to compare odor mixtures and provides a foundation for future efforts towards better understanding the olfactory properties of mixtures.",

    "title": "From labels to latents: revealing state-dependent hippocampal computations with Jump Latent Variable Model",
    "content": "Neural activity is usually interpreted by imposing external labels (e.g., stimuli or position during locomotion) and decoding within that space (e.g. replay). While powerful, such supervision can mask structure in the data that do not correspond to the label. Unsupervised methods, in turn, often assume smooth latent dynamics and miss genuine discontinuities. We introduce a conceptually simple, computationally efficient latent variable model that infers both (i) the latent variables organizing population activity and (ii) whether their dynamics are continuous or fragmented in time. Fitting reduces to an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure that alternates two operations familiar to systems neuroscience--tuning-curve estimation and label decoding--without requiring external labels. Applied to rodent hippocampal spike recordings, the model reveals distinct population patterns at the same physical position that supervised spatial decoding fails to detect. While learned latents exhibit place-field-like tuning, their reactivation patterns are better distinguished by behavioral states. The model further identifies a continuity-fragmentation axis that characterizes population activities across sleep-wake brain states that is modulated by cholinergic inputs. By not relying on externally imposed spatial labels, our approach exposes structure that supervised approaches obscure and provides a powerful tool for datasets lacking behavioral tracking.",

    "content": "Survival demands instant prioritization of escape over maintenance. To decode the dynamic logic embedded in the static Drosophila connectome (FlyWire v783), we simulated the conflict between predator-evasion, feeding, and grooming to uncover the logic of this switch. We show that escape is a holistic state defined by distributed robustness: it is reliably triggered by only a fraction of visual inputs (LC4/LPLC2) and induces a system-wide pause on behaviors like feeding and grooming. Within this global suppression, we identify a specialized, fail-safe architecture for arresting feeding. A redundant ensemble of neurons (DNge031/CB0565) targets the premotor center Roundup, effectively disfacilitating motor output. Crucially, this inhibition is modular, anatomically distinct from grooming suppression, and relies on additive logic to ensure suppression even if individual components fail. Our results demonstrate how connectome topology implements robust, survival-critical control through distributed neural architecture.",

    "title": "It's All In The Journey: Putative Strategies Extracted from Navigation Paths Predict Spatial Memory and Hippocampal Recruitment",
    "content": "Navigation in the real world may rely on a multitude of different strategies with distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, the characterization of spontaneous strategy use during wayfinding and underlying neural correlates are scarce. We explore data across three groups of participants who performed a virtual navigation task: (I) epilepsy patients undergoing invasive electrophysiological recordings of the hippocampus, and two groups who underwent fMRI scanning: (II) young adults at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (APOE-e4 carriers) and (III) healthy controls. We establish three metrics by which to quantitatively characterize each taken path, with the aim of simultaneously reflecting the putative strategies used by humans to solve the task: 1. straightness of paths; 2. deviation towards the edge of the circular arena; and 3. overlap of individual paths leading to a specific object location, which putatively relate to reliance on allocentric (1) and egocentric reference frames (2 & 3). Extracted metrics were related to performance in the task and to hippocampal activity. We find that strategy use is variable within participant, changes across the experiment, and is adaptive in a group-dependent manner. While hippocampal BOLD activity and theta (gamma) power were generally inversely (positively) related, we found that the recruitment of the hippocampus was both group- and strategy- specific. Our results further our understanding of the heterogeneous and idiosyncratic nature of spatial navigation by revealing how these behaviors are altered by disease and the subsequent compensatory neural dynamics, as well as the link between mesoscopic and macroscopic neural signals.",

    "title": "Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation modulates Pavlovian bias in a state-dependent manner",
    "content": "The vagus nerve transmits vital signals between organ systems of the body and the brain. Despite growing interest in non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) for treatments of various disorders, it is not known whether its modulatory effects on behavior are dependent on bodily states. Here, we used a single-blind randomized crossover design with two within-participant factors, stimulation (right tVNS vs. sham) and metabolic state (water vs. caloric load), to investigate 54 healthy participants (210 sessions). To evaluate state-dependent changes in reinforcement learning, we used a valenced go/no-go task. Performance on this task can be used to estimate a Pavlovian choice bias, which captures improved performance for valence-congruent actions (e.g., go to win rewards) versus valence-incongruent actions (e.g., no-go to win rewards) and has been associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission. In line with theorized state-dependency of tVNS-induced changes, we observed that tVNS decreased Pavlovian response biases (Go x Win) after the caloric load (Stimulation x Load: p = .038). Taking into account individual changes in hunger but not satiety ratings best captured behavioral modulation, indicating that this modulatory effect could be driven by motivational effects related to metabolic interoception (sensed \"need\"). We conclude that right tVNS decreases Pavlovian response biases if the body is in a postprandial, but not a fasting state. Since fasting and Pavlovian biases have been previously associated with elevated dopamine neurotransmission, our results call for additional research on state-dependent motivational effects of tVNS to optimize interventions.",

    "title": "Cognitive state dependent enhancement of cognitive control with transcranial magnetic stimulation",
    "content": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet variability of therapeutic responses remains high. A key contributor to this variability may be state-dependent effects of brain stimulation, where activity in underlying circuits can shape the propagation of TMS-evoked activity. Thus, pushing target circuits into a desired state by engaging cognition may sensitise those circuits to TMS-evoked plasticity. We tested whether TMS effects on cognitive control, a transdiagnostic construct implicated across psychiatric disorders and a putative mediator of TMS efficacy, are state-dependent. Participants (N = 25) completed a context-dependent behavioural assay of cognitive control before and after we delivered rTMS to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). During rTMS, participants performed either the cognitive control task (active-state TMS), or performed a context-independent perceptual task (control-state TMS). We assessed changes in downstream behavioural metrics of circuit function, as well as neural indices of cognitive control measured from electroencephalography (EEG). rTMS enhanced cognitive control performance only when PFC-anchored control circuits were actively engaged during stimulation. Similarly, only active-state TMS modulated theta band oscillatory activity, which is thought to be a marker of cognitive control engagement. Moreover, modulation of those EEG indices by TMS predicted gains in behavioural performance in the cognitive control task. These findings demonstrate that TMS effects on cognitive control are state-dependent, in which endogenous engagement of PFC-anchored networks can shape the magnitude and functional relevance of TMS-induced plasticity. Considering cognitive states during TMS may therefore offer a framework to enhance and/or accelerate TMS therapeutic effects.",

    "title": "Effects of height-induced postural threat on static and dynamic balance performance in healthy individuals: a systematic review with meta-analysis",
    "content": "BackgroundHeight-induced postural threat, such as standing or walking at elevation, elicits fear-related adaptations in balance control. Understanding these adaptations is crucial for interpreting motor behavior under anxiety and for informing rehabilitation and fall-prevention interventions. However, no previous systematic review with meta-analysis has quantified how height exposure influences balance performance.ObjectiveThe objective was to aggregate, characterize, and quantify the effects of height-related postural threat on static and dynamic balance performance.MethodsA systematic literature search in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus was conducted from their inception date until 15 September 2025. Eligible cross-sectional studies compared ground-level (no threat) versus elevated (threat) conditions in healthy participants. Static balance outcomes during upright stance included sway amplitude and frequency; dynamic balance outcomes while walking included gait velocity. Included studies were coded for gender, age, postural threat conditions, balance assessment/outcome, and test modality. Methodological study quality/design and risk of bias was assessed using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics, and sensitivity was evaluated via Leave-One-Out method. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated and analyses were stratified by age group (i.e., children, young adults, older adults).ResultsThe search identified a total of N\u202f=\u202f438 records, and 25 of them (involving a total of 877 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Concerning static balance (18 studies, 44 comparisons), postural threat resulted in small-sized (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.20) decreases in sway amplitude measures and in large-sized (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.06) increases in sway frequency measures, indicating a potentially protective \u201cstiffening\u201d response. However, children did not use the \u201cstiffening\u201d response when standing at height (sway amplitude: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.41; sway frequency: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.04). Regarding dynamic balance (7 studies, 16 comparisons), postural threat led to large-sized (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.33) declines in gait velocity, and this was more pronounced for conditions with a high (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.78) than a low (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.05) difficulty level.ConclusionHeight-induced postural threat evoked functional changes in static (i.e., decrease/increase in sway amplitude/frequency measures) and dynamic (i.e., decrease in walking speed measures) postural control. For static balance this is indicative of an effective \u201cstiffening\u201d response which is apparently not yet developed in children. For the dynamic balance, the further decrease in gait velocity during difficult walking conditions at height implies a compensatory mechanism to increase stability. Despite consistent direction and magnitude of effects, substantial between-study heterogeneity limits the generalizability of these findings, and results should therefore be interpreted with caution.",

    "title": "Lightweight deep learning models for EEG decoding: a review",
    "content": "Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices by decoding electroencephalography (EEG)signals into actionable commands. As a noninvasive and portable modality, EEG-based BCIs hold promise for applications ranging from neurorehabilitation to assistive technologies. However, their performance depends critically on the accurate extraction of relevant neural features and the reliable recognition of underlying patterns. Deep learning has transformed this process. By automatically learning complex, task-relevant representations from raw or minimally processed EEG data, deep neural networks have surpassed many traditional handcrafted feature approaches in both accuracy and adaptability. Yet, the substantial computational and memory demands of many deep learning architectures limit their deployment in portable or real-time BCI systems. This challenge has motivated a growing interest in lightweight models-architectures optimized to reduce complexity while preserving or even enhancing performance. This paper provides a systematic review of such lightweight deep learning models for EEG signal classification. To organize this landscape, existing approaches are categorized into three main strategies: (1) information integration strategies based on multi-scale feature fusion, (2) hidden layer optimization strategies, and (3) hybrid improvement strategies based on structural optimization. The review synthesizes recent advances, identifies emerging trends, and outlines potential directions for future research. These insights aim to inform the design of efficient and robust EEG classification architectures capable of meeting the practical demands of real-world BCI applications.",

    "title": "Evaluating the clinical readiness of artificial intelligence in EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis",
    "content": "Objective. Automated electroencephalography (EEG)-based epilepsy diagnosis has reported near-perfect accuracies for almost two decades on a benchmark dataset, yet virtually no system is used in routine care. We critically re-examined this translation gap by reproducing five widely cited Artificial Intelligence (AI) models spanning statistical feature extraction, classical machine-learning and deep-learning paradigms, and assessed their ability to generalise from the benchmark dataset to a newly curated, clinically verified scalp-EEG cohort. Approach. All models were implemented as originally described and trained with ten-fold cross-validation on the benchmark dataset. External validation was performed on our independently curated dataset made publicly available, comprising 30 subjects (15 epilepsy, 15 healthy) recorded with 19-channel scalp EEG under standard clinical protocols. We further examined the influence of subject-level data leakage by contrasting performance when training/testing samples overlapped with those when completely independent patient partitions were enforced. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of ROC (with 95% Confidence Intervals) were the primary metrics. Main results. When transferred unchanged to the external cohort, overall accuracy fell from 94% on the benchmark dataset to 42%\u201353%, with sensitivities as low as 0.97% for the deep convolutional neural network and specificities dropping to 4% for time-frequency methods. Permitting subject overlap artificially elevated accuracy to 59%\u201396%, whereas strict patient separation reduced it to 41%\u201353% in 95% Confidence Interval. Deep-learning models exhibited the steepest decline, confirming over-fitting to subject-specific artefacts. Statistical feature\u2013based approaches, though less affected, still under-performed clinically acceptable thresholds. Significance. Our results expose key translational barriers in AI for EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis\u2013data leakage, acquisition bias, and overfitting to patient idiosyncrasies\u2013leading to severe performance erosion on clinical data. Rigorous patient-independent validation, transparent reporting (aligned with CARE principles), and well-curated multi-channel scalp-EEG datasets are essential to ensure clinically dependable AI tools for epilepsy diagnosis.",

    "title": "Neuroinvasion by Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Triggers Glial Senescence and Accelerated Neurodegeneration",
    "content": "Virus-induced accelerated aging has emerged as a potential contributor to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), despite widespread implementation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Although evidence of accelerated aging in people living with HIV (PLWH) has been reported, most investigations of acute infection rely on in vitro systems or small animal models, leaving a critical gap in understanding early neuropathological events. To address this, we analyzed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissues from rhesus macaques acutely infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We focused on two key aging-related proteins: the cellular senescence marker p16INK4a (p16) and the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). We hypothesized that accelerated aging phenotypes would be detectable during acute infection, manifesting as increased p16 expression and altered SIRT1 levels, correlating with neurodegeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed marked upregulation of GFAP and p16, along with evidence of neurodegeneration, across multiple brain regions - including the frontal lobe, caudate, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum - by 21 days post-infection. These findings suggest that aging-related and senescence pathways are activated almost immediately following HIV infection, highlighting the potential importance of astrocyte- or CNS-specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate early neuropathology.",

    "title": "The Overlap Area as a Novel Measure of Effect Size in Neuroscience Research",
    "content": "In experimental biomedical research, a common concern is whether a manipulation produces a biologically meaningful effect. Another concern is whether effect sizes are reliable, statistically significant, and generalizable. Traditional effect size measures, such as Cohens d, quantify mean differences but ignore variance heterogeneity between groups. This can result in biased effect size estimates and a lack of thresholds for statistical significance testing. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel effect size measure, termed overlap area (OA), which quantifies the difference between the population distributions of the experimental and control groups. A robust Bayesian method estimated OA, and random resampling determined OA thresholds for statistical significance in single and replicated experiments. Simulations confirmed the approach's sensitivity and robustness. Applied to a real-world dataset, OA revealed that environmental enrichment affects the mouse brain synaptome. Moreover, we developed an open-source toolbox supporting OA as a powerful new measurement for conducting robust, reliable, and reproducible analyses of manipulation effects in neuroscience and related fields.",

It\u2019s a browser extension called Lingoku.<p>The idea is simple: we spend hours browsing the web in English every day. This tool replaces some of the english words with Japanese vocabulary based on your japanese level (Similar to Toucan, but with a better user experience).<p>It\u2019s basically an attempt to make the \"i+1\" method actually passive, you understand the sentence because it's mostly english, but you pick up Japanese words naturally from the context. It uses an LLM in the backend to make sure the translations fit the context (so it distinguishes between different meanings of the same word).<p>since it uses paid AI APIs for the words replacement, I couldn't make it 100% free (server costs are real, unfortunately). However, there is a \"forever free\" plan with daily credits that doesn't require a credit card. it should be enough for casual daily browsing.<p>I built this because I struggle with Anki burnout and wanted a way to review words without feeling like i am \"studying\"<p>It supports Chrome, Edge, and Firefox now. would love any feedback or feature requests!<p><a href=\"https://lingoku.ai/learn-japanese\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lingoku.ai/learn-japanese</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46296863\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46296863</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Neural geometric representations of social memory for multi-individuals in medial prefrontal cortex",
    "content": "Social memory is an ability to recognize specific identities and remember experience with acquainted individuals. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is one of key brain areas executing this function. However, it is unknown how mPFC neurons encode multiple social identities. By developing a new social-identity discrimination task, where a mouse encounters four conspecifics along with in vivo recordings of mPFC neuron spiking activity, we, here, report that the memory of individual social identities can maintain up to two weeks and are robustly encoded by tuned geometric subspaces in mPFC population activity. On contrary, only few neurons exhibit exclusively social-selective responses. Using a cross-session alignment approach of the linear regression and joint-dimensionality reduction, we identify specific low-dimensional neural-subspaces differentially representing individuals over days. Importantly, shifts in social valence, caused by conditioning rewarding, aversive or neutral stimuli associated with different interacted individuals, significantly increase distance and angle between each neural-subspaces. The latter changes in neural representations result from progressive recruitments of neurons that encode associated information of individual valence and identity. Thus, our findings elucidate that tuned neural subspaces in the mPFC underlie a stable encoding of multiple social identities over days, providing a computational framework for understanding complex social memory.",

    "content": "Stress caused by external stressors, such as painful stimulation, can elicit a drastic set of behavioral responses. Such stress responses normally decay soon after the stressor disappears, but can become persistent when the stressor becomes longer and/or repeated. The neuronal mechanism underlying the persistence of stress responses, however, remains elusive. Here, we discovered that repeated electric shocks persistently suppress male Drosophila's courtship behavior. We comprehensively evaluated the physiological changes in the genetically defined courtship circuitry, and found that a courtship-triggering node of the circuitry, called P1 neurons, is preferentially and persistently suppressed following electric shocks. Our data uncovers in a comprehensively defined courtship circuitry that repeated stress persistently suppresses a critical node of the circuitry in a targeted fashion to alter behavior.",

    "title": "Pharmacological Inhibition of FKBP51 Mitigates Early Life Adversity-Induced Social Deficits",
    "content": "Early life adversity (ELA) is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders, but targeted preventative strategies are lacking due to poor mechanistic insight. The FKBP51 protein, a co-chaperone of the glucocorticoid receptor, is a key mediator of stress vulnerability. We tested if pharmacological inhibition of FKBP51 with the selective inhibitor SAFit2 prevents the long-term consequences of ELA. Mice exposed to ELA exhibited persistent deficits in social behavior, manifesting as social subordination in adolescence and adulthood. Early-life SAFit2 treatment fully rescued these ELA-induced behavioral impairments. Transcriptional profiling across six stress-relevant brain regions revealed that SAFit2 normalized ELA-driven gene expression changes, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Functional analysis showed the rescue converged on immunoregulatory and neuroactive ligand-receptor signaling pathways. Our findings establish FKBP51 as a critical pharmacological target for reversing the lasting impact of early life adversity on brain function, offering a path toward preventative treatment for ELA-related psychopathology.",

    "title": "Single-cell transcriptomics and mouse model phenotyping for biomarker screen of peripheral blood biomarkers in Huntington disease",
    "content": "Transcriptional dysregulation is among the most prominent molecular alterations in Huntington disease (HD). It is not confined to brain but is also extended to peripheral tissues and cells, enabling minimally invasive screens aimed at identifying transcriptional surrogates of the health status in HD mutation carriers. Nonetheless, transcriptomics approaches have failed to identify consistent candidates from peripheral blood, probably due to the low impact of the HD mutation in the transcriptional profiles of circulating cells that can be masked by the high cellular complexity of this biofluid. In this study, we applied for the first time single-cell RNA-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to determine those cells that accumulate the most prominent gene expression changes as potential sources of reliable biomarkers. We observed both specific and common transcriptional alterations across different blood cell subtypes, justifying partial overlapping of our results with published bulk transcriptomics datasets. To relate these gene expression patterns with disease progression in the absence of a large cohort of patients, we examined selected candidates in a phenotypically characterized cohort of transgenic R6/1 mice. Of the tested genes, only the changes in the interferon related gene Irf7 in blood were correlated with motor coordination performance in mutant mice. Notably, this gene was significantly upregulated in the striatum of these animals. Overall, transcriptional-based changes in peripheral blood can be linked to HD although dissection of individual blood cells in combination with subsequent validation in mouse models emphasizes the challenges in obtaining clinically relevant biomarkers in HD.",

    "title": "Peripheral regeneration of A\u03b2 low-threshold mechanoreceptors is limited despite activation of regenerative transcriptional pathways",
    "content": "Peripheral neurons can regenerate after nerve injury, yet functional recovery is often incomplete due to non-specific or incomplete target reinnervation. Among sensory neuron subtypes, A{beta} low-threshold mechanoreceptors (A{beta}-LTMRs) mediate discriminative touch, a modality often incompletely restored after nerve injury. However, the mechanisms governing A{beta}-LTMR regeneration remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterised the anatomical and transcriptional features of A{beta}-LTMRs regeneration after nerve injury. We assessed the extent of axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve crush and the preferential regeneration following femoral nerve transection using Calb1-Cre/tdTomato reporter mice. In both models, regeneration was incomplete, failing to reach control values. Moreover, A{beta}-LTMRs preferentially reinnervated cutaneous rather than muscle pathways. To define the molecular program underlying this response, we performed ribosome-bound RNA sequencing from Calb1-Cre/Ribotag mice 7 days after nerve crush. A{beta}-LTMRs upregulated canonical regeneration-associated genes, including Atf3, Sprr1a, Gal, and Gap43. Comparison with published RNA-seq datasets from other sensory neuron populations revealed only modest overlap, indicating that the core injury response shared between neurons is accompanied by a neuron subtype-specific programme. Together, these findings define the regenerative profile of A{beta}-LTMRs across anatomical and transcriptomic levels, revealing the limited regenerative capacity of this neuron subpopulation despite robust activation of classical regeneration-associated genes.",

    "title": "Elevated neuronal TAF15 expression leads to FTD-like phenotype",
    "content": "TAF15, a DNA/RNA-binding protein whose dysfunction in alternative splicing impairs NMDA receptor signaling, can form amyloid fibrils that contribute to neurodegeneration in the neurodegenerative diseases like FTD and ALS, indicating a close involvement of TAF15 in both neuronal physiological function and activation of pathological pathways. However, the relationship between TAF15 expression levels and neurodegeneration, as well as the specific downstream pathways mediating its neurotoxicity, remains unclear. Here, we found a consistent upregulation of TAF15 in prefrontal cortex neurons from patients across multiple FTD and ALS subtypes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that neuronal TAF15 overexpression triggered oxidative stress, evidenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to neurotoxicity and gliosis. Mice overexpressing TAF15 in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons exhibited heightened anxiety and impaired fear memory, mimicking some key features of FTD behavioral abnormalities. Notably, these pathological and behavioral phenotypes are rescued by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), indicating that elevated TAF15 level exacerbates neurodegeneration primarily by activating oxidative stress pathways. Together, this work elucidates a novel TAF15-oxidative stress axis in FTD-associated neurodegeneration, providing a conceptual framework for future therapeutic development.",

    "content": "Introduction: The vagus nerve regulates autonomic processes central to cognition. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) can acutely modulate executive function in healthy adults, but the effects of repeated dosing, roles of executive subdomains, and importance of sex as a biological variable require clarification. Method: In a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled, parallel group study, 12 healthy adults (six women) received 10 consecutive days of left monoaural taVNS (VNS) or sham (CON), with a two-week follow-up rechallenge. Stimulation (100Hz; 200us pulse width) was delivered continuously (online) at rest and during the Eriksen Flanker (inhibition), Wisconsin Card Sorting (shifting), and Sternberg (working memory) tasks. Resting autonomic measures included pupil diameter, skin conductance (SCL), mean R-R interval (mRR), respiration, and blood pressure. Primary outcomes were analyzed with linear mixed models and Sidak-corrected contrasts. Results: Ten days of taVNS produced immediate and cumulative changes in multiple executive function subdomains that remained evident at rechallenge, with the strongest effects on accuracy. Across tasks, benefits were most pronounced in women; men displayed initial performance costs, but with greater longitudinal improvements. Cognitive effects were most evident on higher-difficulty trials. Autonomically, taVNS increased SCL during and after stimulation, amplified stimulus- and task-evoked pupil responses, and transiently lengthened mRR. Stimulation was well tolerated and blinding was acceptable. Conclusions: Resolution of taVNS effects to higher-difficulty trials supports adaptive-gain modulation within executive function networks. The combination of larger evoked pupil/SCR, transient mRR lengthening, and increased SCL indicates that taVNS increased autonomic flexibility and arousal. Our findings identify biological sex and stimulation intensity as potentially important considerations for taVNS efficacy and provide longitudinal estimates to guide dosing, biomarker selection, and trial design. Collectively, the results support continued development of taVNS as a safe tool for the modulation of executive function and autonomic activity in healthy adults.",

    "title": "Parallel neuronal ensembles control behavior across sensorimotor levels in Drosophila",
    "content": "Nervous systems can process information in serial or in parallel, trading off efficiency for flexibility and speed. How these network architectures are implemented across sensorimotor pathways to control behavior is unclear. We investigate this tradeoff directly in Drosophila by comparing neuronal circuits underlying landing and takeoff, behaviors transforming similar visual cues to whole-body motor output. Using a whole-CNS connectome, electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis, we reconstruct the complete feedforward pathway for landing, including visual feature detectors, a dedicated ensemble of descending neurons (DNs), and a core premotor circuit in the nerve cord. Comparison to the takeoff pathway reveals that, despite encoding the same sensory feature and engaging similar muscle groups, neuronal circuits controlling the two behaviors are separated at every sensorimotor level. Extending this analysis to the complete DN population reveals a blueprint for descending motor control: DNs across the behavioral space utilized by the fly are organized as a set of parallel, loosely-overlapping ensembles that form a continuum from command-like control, with individual DNs determining behavioral output, to population coding, with multiple DNs controlling behavior synergistically. Distinct combinations of sensory feature detectors differentially recruit DN ensembles to enable flexible, context-dependent behavioral control.",

    "content": "Proteostasis dysfunction is a hallmark of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimers disease (AD), yet the genetic and molecular pathways that disrupt protein homeostasis remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated human genetics, transcriptomics, and functional studies to identify proteostasis network components involved in tauopathy. We identified 18 proteostasis network genes harboring 75 rare, damaging variants enriched in FTD and/or AD. These genes, spanning multiple proteostasis pathways, were differentially expressed in MAPT mutant neurons and dysregulated in FTD and AD brains. NINL, which encodes Nlp, emerged as the only gene consistently upregulated across all datasets. NINL overexpression reduced tau seeding and enhanced lysosomal proteolytic activity, whereas two FTD-enriched NINL frameshift variants impaired Nlp expression and abolished these protective effects. Together, our findings identify a set of proteostasis genes with genetic and transcriptional links to neurodegeneration and reveal NINL as a novel regulator of tau aggregation, potentially upregulated as an adaptive response to proteotoxic stress.",

Traditional deep learning models have shown promise in these domains, but often struggle with temporal sparsity and energy efficiency, especially in real-time or embedded applications.MethodsIn this study, we propose SpiTranNet, a novel architecture that deeply integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformers through Spiking Multi-Head Attention (SMHA), where spiking neurons replace standard activation functions within the attention mechanism. This integration enables biologically plausible temporal processing and energy-efficient computations while maintaining global contextual modeling capabilities. The model is evaluated across three physiological datasets, including one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset for MI classification and two electrocardiography (ECG) datasets for SA detection.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate that the hybrid SNN-Transformer model achieves competitive accuracy compared to conventional machine learning and deep learning models.DiscussionThis work highlights the potential of neuromorphic-inspired architectures for robust and efficient biomedical signal processing across diverse physiological tasks.",

    "title": "Central auditory processing is altered after traumatic brain injury in Tanzanian adults",
    "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) damages pathways throughout the brain and is a significant global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the incidence is high and long-term deficits are prevalent. This study explores the utility of central auditory processing (CAP) testing as a marker of previous TBI. Seventy individuals with a history of moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) were matched by age and sex to 46 healthy controls in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Participants underwent comprehensive behavioral CAP testing, including tests of speech-in-noise ability, temporal resolution, and dichotic listening. Multivariate logistic regression showed the Triple Digit Test (TDT) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) significantly predicted msTBI status, independent of age and peripheral hearing ability. Elastic net modeling supported these findings, highlighting TDT performance as the most robust predictor of msTBI history. A history of msTBI is associated with poorer CAP performance, particularly on speech-in-noise tests. These tests could serve as accessible, resource-efficient tools for assessing brain function related to TBI in clinical and resource-limited settings. Studies in larger, more diverse populations are needed to explore their predictive utility for long-term cognitive outcomes after TBI.",

    "title": "The role of MICOS in modulating mitochondrial dynamics and structural changes in vulnerable regions of Alzheimer's Disease",
    "content": "Mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complexes are critical for maintaining the mitochrondrial architecture, cristae integrity, and organelle communication in neurons. MICOS disruption has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), yet the spatiotemporal dynamics of MICOS-associated neuronal alterations during aging remain unclear. Using three-dimensional reconstructions of hypothalamic and cortical neurons, we observed age-dependent fragmentation of mitochondrial cristae, reduced intermitochondrial connectivity, and compartment-specific changes in mitochondrial size and morphology. Notably, these structural deficits were most pronounced in neurons vulnerable to AD-related pathology, suggesting a mechanistic link between MICOS disruption and the early mitochondrial dysfunction observed in patients with AD. Our findings indicate that the loss of MICOS integrity is a progressive feature of neuronal aging, contributing to impaired bioenergetics and reduced resilience to metabolic stress and potentially facilitating neurodegenerative processes. MICOS disruption reduced neuronal firing and synaptic responsiveness, with miclxin treatment decreasing mitochondrial connectivity and inducing cristae disorganization. These changes link MICOS structural deficits directly to impaired neuronal excitability, highlighting vulnerability to AD-related neurodegeneration. These results underscore the importance of MICOS as a critical determinant of neuronal mitochondrial health and as a potential target for interventions aimed at mitigating AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "content": "Significance: Behavior scoring is labor-intensive and subjective, introducing variability in results. Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of video understanding offer a transformative solution to manual scoring, crucial for accelerating and standardizing neuroscience workflows. Aim: We sought to benchmark state-of-the-art video LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen3-VL, and VideoLLaMA3) for automated behavioural segmentation and scoring of mice performing a water-reaching task. Approach: Videos of mice performing water reaching from the front view were analysed by the LLMs. Accuracy was compared across different models and against prompt adjustments within Gemini. To assess classification determinants, video fidelity was altered through pixel interpolation and key regions blurred (paws/snout-mouth). In addition, the models were asked to describe the mouse's actions over time. Results: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Mean: 0.74, SD: 0.12) and Qwen3-VL-30B (Mean: 0.67, SD: 0.13) exhibited ability to classify trial outcomes. Reliable classification required a minimum pixel resolution of 0.28 mm per pixel. Accuracy is significantly reduced upon obscuring the snout-mouth area. In 549/1058 of videos, Gemini 2.5 Pro also provided completely accurate frame-to- frame behaviour segmentations. Conclusions: Video-LLMs offer potential to accelerate neuroscience by providing scalable, objective quantification of goal-directed behaviors. By producing temporal annotations, Gemini enables fast first-pass labelling that markedly streamlines manual dataset curation.",

    "title": "MRS4Brain: a processing toolbox for preclinical MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging data",
    "content": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique for probing metabolism and underpins advanced methods such as magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and diffusion-weighted spectroscopy (DWS). MRSI enables spatial mapping of metabolite distributions, offering insights into regional metabolic heterogeneity that single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) cannot capture. However, MRSI produces large multidimensional datasets and requires complex processing pipelines, limiting reproducibility and accessibility. While human studies benefit from advanced processing tools, similar developments in preclinical research remain scarce, highlighting a demand for practical tools accessible to non-experts. To address this need, we introduce the MRS4Brain Toolbox, a freely available MATLAB-based platform for preclinical spectroscopy, including MRSI, SVS, and DWS. The toolbox integrates reconstruction, preprocessing, quantification, quality control, brain segmentation automatically overlaid on metabolite maps, modeling, and statistical analysis into unified workflows accessible via a graphical interface. By streamlining data processing and reducing technical barriers, MRS4Brain Toolbox promotes reproducibility, harmonization, and broader adoption of advanced spectroscopic techniques in preclinical studies, ultimately facilitating translational research.",

    "title": "Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession imaging in the ex vivo macaque brain on a 10.5T human MRI scanner",
    "content": "Diffusion MRI provides a non-invasive probe of local fibre bundles and long-range anatomical connections to characterise the structural connectome. One way to achieve very high spatial resolution diffusion MRI data for connectivity investigations is to scan ex-vivo brains over many hours or days, ideally at ultra-high field strength to boost signal levels. However, conventional diffusion MRI acquisition techniques do not generally deliver good data quality for the challenging conditions of ex-vivo tissue, characterised by reduced diffusivities and relaxation times when compared to in vivo. In this work, we investigate the potential of the diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) sequence for ex vivo diffusion imaging of the macaque brain using a 10.5 T human MRI scanner with a conventional (G_max=70 mT/m) gradient set. SNR-efficiency optimisations incorporating experimental relaxation times demonstrate that the DW-SSFP sequence is predicted to achieve improved or similar SNR efficiency compared to a diffusion-weighted spin- and stimulated-echo sequence. Importantly, DW-SSFP can achieve this with the additional benefit of negligible geometric distortions, unlike conventional diffusion MRI using an echo-planar imaging readout. Using optimised DW-SSFP sequence parameters, we propose a protocol at 0.4 mm isotropic resolution using a two-shell multi-orientation protocol (effective b-values of 3200 s/mm^2 and 5600 s/mm^2). We fit the data using Tensor, Ball and 3-Sticks and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution signal representations. The results demonstrate high-quality diffusivity estimates across the entire brain with the ability to resolve multiple fibre populations in challenging crossing-fibre regions. The data will be made fully open source and multimodal as part of the Center for Mesoscale Connectomics, providing a resource for future connectivity investigations.",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

You export your chat from WhatsApp (without media), run it through the tool, and get an HTML report with analytics. Everything runs locally or in your own Colab session. Nothing gets sent anywhere.</p> <p><a href=\"https://duelion.github.io/whatsapp-wrapped/sample_report.html\">Here is a Sample Report.</a></p> <p>Features include message counts, activity patterns, emoji stats, word clouds, and calendar heatmaps. The easiest way to use it is through <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/Duelion/whatsapp-wrapped/blob/main/whatsapp_wrapped.ipynb\">Google Colab</a> - just upload your chat export and download the report. There's also a CLI for local use.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Anyone who wants to analyze their WhatsApp chats without uploading them to someone else's server. It's ready to use now.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>Unlike other web tools that require uploading your data, this runs entirely on your machine (or your own Colab). It's also open source, so you can see exactly what it does with your chats.</p> <p><strong>Tech:</strong> Python, Polars, Plotly, Jinja2.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/Duelion/whatsapp-wrapped\">GitHub</a> - <a href=\"https://duelion.github.io/whatsapp-wrapped/sample_report.html\">Sample Report</a> - <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/Duelion/whatsapp-wrapped/blob/main/whatsapp_wrapped.ipynb\">Google Colab</a></p> <p>Happy to answer questions or hear feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Duelion\"> /u/Duelion </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1po9n17/whatsapp_wrapped_with_polars_plotly_analyze_chat/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1po9n17/whatsapp_wrapped_with_polars_plotly_analyze_chat/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Rehabilitation drives functional reorganization of intact corticospinal-supraspinal projections following partial spinal cord injury",
    "content": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts corticospinal tract (CST) connectivity and impairs skilled voluntary movement, yet most human SCIs are anatomically incomplete, allowing spared CST pathways to engage in rehabilitation-mediated plasticity to promote functional recovery. How voluntary rehabilitation engages and reorganizes the supraspinal targets of the intact CST remains incompletely understood. Here, we combined unilateral pyramidotomy (uPyX) in male and female mice with continuous voluntary complex-wheel running to test whether fine motor-dependent rehabilitation drives supraspinal CST plasticity. uPyX mice rapidly resumed wheel running after a transient deficit. In contrast to lesion-only controls, rehabilitation significantly improved skilled forelimb performance on the horizontal ladder rung task. Immunohistochemical c-Fos labeling confirmed that complex-wheel running robustly activated the intact forelimb CST in motor cortex. Whole-brain CST projection mapping using intersectional viral vector tracing revealed targeted supraspinal reorganization localized to medullary motor nuclei. Three nuclei - the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (LPGi), gigantocellular reticular nucleus, alpha part (GiA), and ventral medullary reticular nucleus (MdV) - exhibited significant lesion- and/or rehabilitation-induced increases in CST innervation. Rehabilitation-driven CST sprouting correlated with regional c-Fos activation, indicating activity-dependent remodeling. Notably, CST projection density in the MdV, critical for skilled forelimb control, predicted functional recovery. These findings identify a set of spinally-projecting medullary nuclei as key substrates for rehabilitation-induced CST plasticity and highlight the MdV as a potential mediator of restored motor function. This work defines how voluntary rehabilitation reorganizes spared corticospinal pathways and provides targets for optimizing activity-based interventions after SCI.",

    "content": "Delirium is a frequent and serious complication in intensive care patients, arising from overlapping vulnerabilities that obscure its primary causes. Using healthy mice, we tested whether mechanical ventilation combined with inhalation anesthetics and opioid sedation is sufficient to induce delirium-like behavior through disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glymphatic dynamics. We found that ventilation acutely increased intracranial pressure and induced a long-lasting suppression of glymphatic transport, thereby re-routing and impairing brain waste clearance and promoting cytokine accumulation. These observations establish a mechanistic link between ventilator-associated alterations in brain fluid dynamics and delirium. Our findings identify glymphatic dysfunction and disturbed CSF flow as contributors to acute brain dysfunction following mechanical ventilation and suggest that therapies enhancing glymphatic flux or stabilizing intracranial pressure could reduce delirium incidence and severity in critically ill patients.",

    "title": "Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure differentially alters acute ethanol sensitivity of GABAergic transmission in CRFR1- and CRFR1+ CeM neurons",
    "content": "Prenatal exposure to alcohol (PAE) increases the risk for misusing alcohol and/or developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) by adulthood. The corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system is a major target of pre- and post-natal ethanol (EtOH) exposure. CRF and its receptor (CRFR1), in part, mediate EtOH potentiated GABA release in the medial nucleus of the central amygdala (CeM) of adult male rodents. Interestingly, our lab has shown a disruption in the function and expression of CeM CRFR1 and acute EtOH's effects on GABA transmission in PAE adolescent animals, but it is unknown whether these alterations to the CRF system persist into adulthood or alter the actions of acute EtOH on GABAergic transmission in the CeM. Using CRF1-Cre-tdTomato rats, this study examined how moderate PAE alters acute EtOH modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission onto CRFR1+ and CRFR1- CeM neurons in adult offspring (P80-105). Pregnant dams were exposed to vaporized ethanol or room air (control) on gestational day 12 (G12) for 6 hours and whole-cell electrophysiology was performed in the CeM to assess the actions of acute EtOH (44, 66, & 88 mM) on GABAergic transmission onto CRFR1+ and CRFR1- neurons. We found unique effects of PAE that were cell type- and concentration-dependent in males and females, suggesting PAE dysregulates acute EtOH's modulation of GABA transmission within the CeM in a sex-specific manner. This study contributes to the expanding body of research exploring the effects of PAE and how a single exposure can impact neurophysiological mechanisms in brain regions associated with AUD.",

So we built Zenflow, a free desktop tool to orchestrate AI coding workflows.<p>It handles the things we were missing in standard chat interfaces:<p>Cross-Model Verification: You can have Codex review Claude\u2019s code, or run them in parallel to see which model handles the specific context better.<p>Parallel Execution: Run five different approaches on a backlog item simultaneously\u2014mix \"Human-in-the-Loop\" for hard problems with \"YOLO\" runs for simple tasks.<p>Dynamic Workflows: Configured via simple .md files. Agents can actually \"rewire\" the next steps of the workflow dynamically based on the problem at hand.<p>Project list/kanban views across all workload<p>What we learned building this<p>To tune Zenflow, we ran 100+ experiments across public benchmarks (SWE-Bench-*, T-Bench) and private datasets. Two major takeaways that might interest this community:<p>Benchmark Saturation: Models are becoming progressively overtrained on all versions of SWE-Bench (even Pro). We found public results are diverging significantly from performance on private datasets. If you are building workflows, you can't rely on public benches.<p>The \"Goldilocks\" Workflow: In autonomous mode, heavy multi-step processes often multiply errors rather than fix them. Massive, complex prompt templates look good on paper but fail in practice. The most reliable setups landed in a narrow \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zone of just enough structure without over-orchestration.<p>The app is free to use and supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Zencoder.<p>We\u2019ve been dogfooding this heavily, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the default workflows and if they fit your mental model for agentic coding.<p>Download: <a href=\"https://zencoder.ai/zenflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://zencoder.ai/zenflow</a>\nYT flyby: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Ai-klT-B8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Ai-klT-B8</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46290617\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46290617</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "People report having consistent idiosyncratic diets of imagined sensations when they re-experience the past, and pre-experience the future",
    "content": "To some extent, humans can re-experience the sensations of past events and pre-experience the future. These capacities are inter-related. But there are substantial individual differences. At the extremes, small minorities of people report that they either cannot have imagined experiences at all, or that their imagined sensations are as real to them as their actual experiences of the physical world. We wanted to know if such individual differences are uniform across different types of imagined experience (e.g. vision, audio, taste and smell), or if people generally have idiosyncratic patterns of different types (vision, audio, taste and smell) of imagined experiences. We find that people report having idiosyncratic diets of different types of imagined sensation, characterised by differences in salience. One person might have more salient imagined visual than taste experiences, while another reports the reverse. Moreover, these propensities are consistent across peoples attempts to re-experience the past, and to pre-experience the future, and they predict peoples experience and usage of different types of imagined sensation in their everyday lives.",

    "title": "An Interactive Brain Atlas of Knowledge",
    "content": "Biomedical knowledge about the brain increases every day, with a rapidly growing number of scientific publications, datasets, and software tools. While this informational plethora is not merely comprehensible by human beings, recent developments in information science and computational linguistics aim to make this knowledge programmatically accessible by literature mining. However, integrating these semantic methods into neuroimaging standards remains insufficient, hindering researchers from unraveling their full potential. Therefore, we developed the semantic meta-analysis platform The Virtual Brain adapter of semantics (TVBase) that projects biomedical knowledge preserved in over 36 million scientific articles onto a 3D standardized brain. The literature-mining platform SCAIView was used to extract ontologically defined biomedical entities and their associations with brain anatomy from the PubMed database. By querying a specific concept, the association strength with each anatomical term was calculated using entropy. To project the data onto a standardized brain, we created a unique transformation matrix that links over 800 anatomical terms to voxel coordinates of a parcellated standard brain. This novel method of knowledge projection extracts region-specific information about biomedical concepts from the literature to support translational multi-scale approaches to computational neuroscience. The multi-purpose software framework TVBase is openly available as a Python library. It aims for hypothesis-free neuroimaging pattern interpretation, hypothesis generation, and applications in personalized medicine.",

    "content": "Sensory processing in the mammalian cortex relies on extensive feedforward and feedback connections, yet how information is routed along these pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the functional properties of feedback and feedforward neurons in the mouse olfactory (piriform) cortex. We selectively labeled neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB, feedback) or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, feedforward) and recorded their activity during passive odor exposure and learning of an odor discrimination task. We found that odor identity and reward associations were encoded by OB-projecting ensembles early during odor exposure, whereas mPFC-projecting neurons encoded this information later, aligned with behavioral responses. Moreover, mPFC-projecting neurons maintained a stable representation of valence across days, while OB-projecting neurons exhibited pronounced plasticity. Together, these findings reveal that odor information is selectively routed through feedforward and feedback pathways and suggest that the functional properties of piriform neurons mirror the computational demands of their downstream targets.",

    "content": "Learning from experience is central to human decision making, yet research on experience-based choice remains fragmented across paradigms and disciplines. We present the Decision-from-Experience Database (DfE-DB), a standardized, openly accessible resource comprising 3.8 million trial-level decisions from 11,921 participants across 168 studies and 13 paradigms. By harmonizing raw behavioral data and classifying studies along 13 key design features, the database enables quantitative comparisons previously obscured by heterogeneous task and data structures. Using this resource, we show that choice tendencies--toward higher risk, expected value, or experienced mean--vary substantially across paradigms and are strongly shaped by core design features such as feedback type, outcome structure, stationarity, and sampling. These features explain substantial cross-study variability and reveal underexplored paradigm variants. DfE-DB provides the empirical infrastructure necessary to test the generality of behavioral phenomena and computational models, fostering a more integrated science of decisions from experience.",

Here, adult rats (Sprague-Dawley males) were trained in ideal quiet conditions to learn a tone-reward associative task while treated with RGFP966 (TRAINED+RGFP966, n = 6) to determine if learning-related effects on AC could support tone-signal detection in a later background noise challenge. RGFP966 accelerated sound-reward learning relative to a trained but untreated group of rats (TRAINED, n = 5), though all animals ultimately reached equivalent high levels of performance prior to testing. Training produced a sound-specific enhancement in AC responses evoked by the signal tone, and a sound-general effect that suppressed responses during steady-state noise, relative to untrained rats (NAIVE, n = 7). Effects were strongest when training was with RGFP966 administration and scaled with increasing signal-to-noise (SNR). High levels of background noise abolished sound-specific enhancements in tone-signal evoked AC activity, yet the general suppressive effect to noise was maintained. Remarkably, behavioral responses to the signal tone in different SNRs recapitulated AC patterns of tone-evoked responding. Overall, rapid auditory learning facilitated by RGFP966 yields AC plasticity that can improve signal detection. Learning-induced mechanisms appear to shape cortical decoding mechanisms that selectively enhance representations of signal sounds and suppress the effects of background noise.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

    "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
    "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

Although neuroimaging studies have linked retrieval suppression to the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), direct evidence for the causal role this region plays in supporting SIF is still lacking. In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC.

    "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
    "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

    "content": "Temporal prediction allows animals to align their actions with upcoming events, yet most work has focused on explicit duration judgments rather than the implicit timing that shapes ongoing behavior. Here, we ask how medial prefrontal cortex implements such latent temporal expectations and how cerebellar input contributes. Head-fixed mice learned a cued water-delivery task in which reward occurred after either a short or long delay, or after a single fixed delay. During variable delays, running and licking became anticipatory, and medial prefrontal local field potentials and single neurons showed ramping and reward-locked activity patterns aligned to expected reward time. Switching to a fixed delay rapidly sharpened behavioral anticipation and temporal coding. Optogenetic activation of cerebellar Purkinje cells selectively perturbed these dynamics and biased behavior around the earliest possible reward time. These results identify a cerebello-prefrontal circuit that encodes implicit temporal predictions on the sub-second scale.",

    "title": "How learned expectations shape brain-wide responses",
    "content": "Expectations stemming from prior knowledge have long been known to influence stimulus processing and decision-making. Empowered by brain-wide recordings during a two-choice sensory decision-making task from the International Brain Laboratory, we sought to identify the form of expectation-based modulations and how they influence ongoing computations. To discern where, when, and how prior knowledge about the stimulus -- known to be stored in the brain over the inter-trial period -- influences brain activity over the arc from stimulus processing to choice selection and action generation, we disentangled the encoding of the highly correlated stimulus, choice, and prior variables as sensory processors, choice/integration processors, and movement generators. We examined which brain regions were modulated by prior expectations and at which point in the task, and characterized whether those modulations take the form of biasing initial activations or response gains. We found that the activities of choice/integrators and movement generators were influenced by prior expectation, while purely stimulus processors were not significantly modulated by prior expectation. In addition, we found that expectation-based modulation takes the form of both initial activity bias and gain modulation in integration/choice computations and in movement generators. We further find that the brain-wide recordings reveal an emergent simplicity: A few-parameter mechanistic neural circuit model captures the population dynamics of stimulus response, integration/choice processing, and action initiation, as well as their modulations by the prior. After fitting to physiology, the model's behavior predicts the psychometric and chronometric behavior of mice with no additional parameters. It reveals that the larger bias and gain modulations of movement initiators relative to integration/choice in the data and model is inherited by amplifying integrator/choice inputs rather than being an additional expectation-based effect. Collectively, our results characterize in fine spatiotemporal detail and brain-wide breadth the mechanisms and loci where prior expectations influence cognition, while the novel synthesis between large-scale electrophysiology and mechanistic modeling reveals an organizing simplicity behind perceptual decision making across the brain.",

    "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
    "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

    "title": "Representing Visual Objects, Attention, and Load in Human Occipito-temporal and Posterior Parietal Cortices",
    "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

    "title": "Bilateral Field Advantage of Spatial Attention in Macaque Lateral Prefrontal Cortex",
    "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

    "title": "The Otter and the Cleaver: Exploring the Neural Underpinnings of Unitization Using the Gestalt Principle of Proximity",
    "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

    "title": "Cross-species consensus atlas of the primate basal ganglia",
    "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) are conserved brain regions essential for motor control, learning, emotion, and cognition, and are implicated in neurological and psychiatric disease. Yet a unified cross-species taxonomy of BG cell types is lacking, limiting translation of BG circuit mechanisms, interpretation of human genetic risk, and development of cell type-targeted tools. We present a multiomic consensus atlas of 1.8 million nuclei from human, macaque, and marmoset spanning eight BG structures. Integrating cross-species gene expression, open chromatin, and spatial profiling enables definition of conserved and divergent cell types. Alignment to existing mouse and human atlases identifies 61 homologous cell types conserved over 80 million years. We identify a STRd D2 StrioMat Hybrid medium spiny neuron (MSN) type with molecular, electrophysiological, and morphological features that clarify hybrid MSN identities. Comparative cis-regulatory analysis reveals conserved sequence grammars that encode cell identity and inform viral targeting strategies, providing a foundational resource for BG evolution, function, and disease.",

    "title": "Neural pathways of voice perception: a comparative dMRI study between humans and macaques.",
    "content": "The processing of vocal stimuli in the human brain involves multiple regions that are selectively tuned to voice information. Similarly, voice-sensitive areas have been identified in macaques, suggesting a common neural mechanism across species. However, the structural connectivity underlying voice perception in both humans and macaques remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the structural connectivity of voice-sensitive regions in 4 humans and 3 macaques using awake functional MRI and diffusion MRI techniques. Our findings reveal that while humans and macaques differ in the anatomical organization of projections from the anterior Temporal Voice Area (aTVA), the organization of projections from the primary auditory cortex (A1) is nearly identical. Our results also demonstrate distinct connectivity patterns between the vocal areas of the two species, as well as an opposite pattern of lateralization of aTVA-A1 connectivity in humans and macaques. These results enhance our understanding of the neural circuits involved in voice perception and provide valuable insights into the comparative neurobiology of vocal communication.",

    "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

    "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "title": "Automated estimation of frequency and spatial extent of periodic and rhythmic epileptiform activity from continuous electroencephalography data",
    "content": "Objective. Rhythmic and periodic patterns (RPPs) are harmful brain activity observed on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of critically ill patients. This work describes automatic methods for detection of the frequency and spatial extent of specific RPPs: lateralized and generalized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA, GRDA) and lateralized and generalized periodic discharges (LPD, GPD). Approach. The frequency and spatial extent of RPPs is estimated using signal processing and rule-based logic. Three algorithm variants based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Hilbert\u2013Huang transforms (HHT) were developed for rhythmic delta activity, and three using derivative and time-based peak detection for periodic discharges. Annotations from three expert neurophysiologists served as the gold standard, and inter-rater reliability (IRR) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to assess performance. Main results. We evaluated the algorithms on segments with 100% agreement on event classification (n = 389) and on the full cohort of 1087 segments (including disagreements). For the first subset, top algorithms matched or exceeded expert agreement for RPP frequency/spatial extent. RDA1b-FFT, the best algorithm for rhythmic delta activity, showed an expert-algorithm IRR of good to excellent with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 91% and 96% (MAE 0.13 Hz and 0.26 Hz) frequency, and ICCs of 85% and 66% (MAE 0.19 and 0.09) for spatial extent for LRDA and GRDA. For periodic discharges, PD2a, showed and expert-algorithm IRR ICC of 80% and 61% (MAE 0.41 Hz and 0.15 Hz) for frequency, and ICC 77% and 13% (MAE 0.17 and 0.40) for spatial extent of LPD and GPD. For the full cohort, IRR declined, but expert-algorithm IRR remained comparable or superior to experts. Significance. The presence of RPPs at high frequencies and spatial extent are associated with a higher probability of poor outcomes. The proposed algorithms for estimating frequency and spatial extent of RPPs match expert performance and are a viable tool for large-scale EEG analysis.",

    "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
    "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "title": "Attention to Psuedo-Tone Melodies Enhances Cortical but Not Brainstem Responses in Humans",
    "content": "Auditory selective attention, the ability to focus on specific sounds while ignoring competitors, enables communication in complex soundscapes. Though attention clearly modulates cortical responses to sound, whether and where this modulation occurs in subcortical structures remains disputed. Here, we use electroencephalography to record cortical and subcortical (auditory brainstem responses, ABRs) activity during a selective attention task. Human participants attend to a 3-note melody in one pitch range presented to one ear while ignoring a competing, interleaved melody in a different pitch range played to the other ear (Laffere et al., 2020, 2021). The melodies consist of pitch-evoking pseudo-tones formed by convolving a periodic impulse train with a brief tone pip. These stimuli allow us to measure both ABRs (elicited by each individual tone pip within a pseudo-note) and cortical responses (elicited by the onsets of pseudo-notes) simultaneously. We observed robust ABRs, but no evidence of modulation by attention. Conversely, cortical responses, measured by event related potentials (ERPs), demonstrated attentional modulation of the P1-N1 peak. We conclude that attentional modulation within the brainstem is not measurable in the well-defined peaks of the ABR, which themselves reflect processing up to the input stage to the inferior colliculus.",

    "title": "Loose coupling between Ca2+ channels and release sensors as a synaptic correlate of higher order brain function",
    "content": "In the mature neocortex, functionally distinct areas are built by the same archetypes of neurons, but depending on the area, these neurons and their synapses are engaged in very different functions, ranging from lower order processing of sensory information to higher order associations and cognitive functions. We found significant differences in the functional presynaptic nanoarchitectures of the same types of pyramidal neuron synapses, depending on whether they are located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Synapses in PFC operated with loose microdomain coupling as opposed to tight nanodomain coupling in S1. These differences were associated with significant differences in synaptic timing, efficacy and plasticity between areas. Our data suggest that the mature neocortex uses tuning of synaptic topographies to specialize seemingly identical types of neurons for their required function. They reveal microdomain coupling as a presynaptic structure-function correlate of higher order neocortical functions.",

    "title": "The Inferior Frontal Sulcus, not the Anterior Insula, acts as a late-stage attentional gate for the fast rejection of salient but irrelevant sensory inputs during cognitive tasks",
    "content": "The ability to prioritize behaviorally relevant stimuli is essential for efficient cognition, particularly in distracting environments. The anterior insula (AI), a key node of the salience network, has been proposed to support this selection process by detecting salient events. A similar function, however, has also been attributed to the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), located at the intersection of the ventral and dorsal attention networks. Here, we directly compared the respective contributions of these regions to attentional gatekeeping - the identification and rejection of attention-grabbing yet task-irrelevant \"false positives\" to preserve cognitive resources. We recorded intracranial EEG from 63 patients performing an attentive reading task designed to dissociate salience from task relevance. High-Frequency Activity (HFA) responses between 50 Hz and 150 Hz revealed that the IFS was the only region - across extensive sampling of the frontal and insular cortices - to exhibit consistent, subsecond response dynamics compatible with the filtering of false positives. In contrast, the AI did not participate in the analysis or rejection of distractors and showed only sparse, delayed responses to targets, suggesting a role in coordinating or energizing downstream cognitive or motor processes rather than in salience detection per se. These findings indicate that the IFS - rather than the AI - is the primary late-stage node for attentional gatekeeping during cognitive tasks performed under distracting conditions.",

    "title": "Multi-task Intracranial EEG recordings reveal a Comprehensive Role of the Human Dorsal Anterior Insula in High-Level Cognition",
    "content": "The dorsal anterior insula (dAI) is widely recognized as a cornerstone of human cognition. However, its functional characterization remains the subject of considerable debate and competing theories. Embracing a \"shift in viewpoint\" approach - defining a brain region's function through the observation of the same neural population across diverse experimental contexts - this study used intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from a large cohort of patients to investigate the sub-second neural response dynamics of the human dAI across a broad range of cognitive tasks, spanning visual category discrimination, phonological and semantic processing, attentive visual search, and verbal and visuospatial working memory. This within-subject, multi-task iEEG framework offered a robust basis for decoding the structure-function relationship of the dAI and for empirically testing key predictions of prevailing theoretical models concerning its role. Our findings confirmed the dAI's involvement in the Action-Mode Network and shed new light on the large-scale spatiotemporal organization of that network, while providing novel insights into the interplay between cognitive effort and efficiency.",

    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
    "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

    "title": "Sex differences in depression in Parkinson\u2019s disease: cognitive dysfunction and female-specific associations",
    "content": "ObjectiveThis study used a linear mixed model to explore the relationship between cognitive function and depression in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) patients.ParticipantsThe study data were collected from 450 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients who participated in the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Progress Marker Project (PPMI) from 2010 to 2024, including 176 women and 274 men.MeasurementsCognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (Moca), and depression was measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The correlation between cognitive function and depression was determined using a linear mixed model.ResultsAnxiety, daily living ability, and autonomic nervous system function are significant factors affecting both men and women. Women experience a stronger impact of anxiety, daily activity limitations, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction on depression. The longer the duration of the illness, the more severe the depression in women. Moreover, cognitive abilities protect against depression only in women. Women exhibit higher individual heterogeneity in baseline depression and greater variability in the rate of change over time, with those who are more depressed showing a more gradual change.ConclusionIn female Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, there is a negative correlation between cognitive ability and depression, whereas this correlation is not observed in male patients. This study provides new evidence that sex differences influence the relationship between cognitive ability and depression in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients. Future research should consider the role of sex differences in the context of cognitive ability and depression.",

    "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
    "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

    "title": "Task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts are indexed by frontal-midline theta ramping",
    "content": "In everyday vision, we often shift attention internally without external cues. These self-initiated attention shifts are fundamental to voluntary behavior but are poorly understood because most studies use cue-based paradigms that predetermine when and where to shift attention. To address this gap, we designed a multi-sequential-choice rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm with identical visual inputs to dissociate internal and external determinants of attention across three voluntary shift types: task-constrained self-initiated, externally instructed, and unconstrained free-viewing. Participants viewed four simultaneous streams of letters and made overt attention shifts among them, while EEG was recorded. We time-locked theta (4\u20137 Hz) and alpha (8\u201312 Hz) oscillations to shift onset and found distinct signatures for each condition. Notably, a frontal-midline theta ramping was observed before self-initiated shifts but not before instructed or free-viewing shifts, suggesting a preparatory buildup of cognitive control specific to internally driven shifts. Concurrently, sustained suppression of posterior alpha occurred before self-initiated shifts. In contrast, instructed and free-viewing shifts showed relatively higher posterior alpha. These findings suggest that internally generated, goal-driven shifts engage an anticipatory frontal control mechanism indexed by theta increase and reduce posterior inhibition, whereas externally cued or unguided shifts do not. By isolating these condition-specific neural dynamics under identical external stimuli, our study identifies a unique oscillatory signature, frontal-midline theta ramping, associated with task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts.",

    "content": "Growing evidence highlights a tight interplay linking circadian and sleep\u2013wake disturbances to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. In \u03b1-synucleinopathies, three key points have emerged: (1) circadian and sleep\u2013wake disruptions may increase the risk of neurodegeneration; (2) these alterations reflect widespread dysfunction in neural circuits regulating sleep, wakefulness, and biological rhythms; and (3) the prodromal condition of isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) offers a unique window into early pathological changes, as it is characterized by neurodegeneration in brainstem structures critical for sleep\u2013wake regulation and REM sleep control. Hence, sleep- and circadian-related biomarkers may represent feasible tools for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment across the spectrum of \u03b1-synucleinopathies. However, despite their potential, diagnostic or therapeutic pathways grounded in sleep and circadian biology have yet to be systematically explored or validated, and key questions remain, including the trajectories that characterize the clinical progression from iRBD to overt \u03b1-synucleinopathies. Key challenges include translational barriers, inter-individual variability in biomarker profiles, and the need for longitudinal studies to define clinically actionable thresholds. Against this backdrop, this mini-review synthesizes current evidence on sleep\u2013wake rhythm alterations in iRBD as a prodromal stage of \u03b1-synucleinopathy-driven neurodegeneration. Candidate circadian biomarkers are discussed, including objective parameters from long-term actigraphic monitoring, encompassing rest\u2013activity rhythms modeled with parametric and non-parametric approaches, as well as physiological indicators such as dim light melatonin onset and core body temperature.",

    "content": "Background/objectivesHigh grade gliomas (HGG) are aggressive brain tumors, most frequently glioblastoma and astrocytoma grade 4. Methylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter in HGG is crucial for temozolomide efficacy. As MGMT promoter methylation (MGMTpm) assessment requires tumor tissue, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of interest for non-invasive prediction. We aimed to analyze volumetric data from edema, contrast-enhancing tumor, necrosis, total-tumor and total-tumor/edema ratio for MGMTpm prediction in HGG. Further we assessed overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) between groups and volumes.MethodsSegmentation was performed using deep learning models (DL-models), DeepBraTumIA and Raidionics, on 70 HGG patients (45 males, 32 MGMTpm). Manual segmentation was conducted in 37 for validation of DL-models. Group differences were evaluated using Man-Whitney U tests and receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves. Multivariate analysis was conducted using logistic regression and bootstrapping. Dice coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Kruskal\u2013Wallis test evaluated DL-model performance.ResultsMGMTpm tumors displayed significantly larger edema, segmented by DeepBraTumIA (p\u202f=\u202f0.03), and lower total-tumor/edema ratio segmented by both DL-models (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Raidionics segmented total-tumor/edema ratio showed highest univariate predictive ability with area under curve 0.687 (sensitivity 46.2%, specificity 87.5%). Multivariate analysis confirmed this, showing that the ratios from both DL-models were the only ROIs to remain independent, significant predictors (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) after controlling for clinical covariates. The overall multivariate models were significant (p\u202f=\u202f0.01) and improved prediction over baseline. ICC showed interclass correlation of 0.96 (contrast-enhancing tumor), 0.50 (tumor necrosis) and 0.90 (peritumoral edema). Segmentation methods demonstrated 83\u201391% median overlap in contrast-enhancing tumor, 67\u201380% in necrosis and 80\u201384% in edema regions. Significant OS and PFS differences were observed, notably being longer in MGMTpm tumors and lower tumor volumes.ConclusionThis study suggests that significant radiological differences in MGMTpm can be found using deep learning models, primarily in tumor edema volume. MGMTpm status and region of interest volumes impact OS and PFS. Future studies should incorporate other molecular imaging sequences for methylation prediction.",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

We conducted two complementary studies: (1) a mixed-methods survey (N=142) employing a 2 (source: Human vs. LLM) $\\times$ 2 (label: Human vs. AI) $\\times$ 3 (type: General, Symptom, Treatment) design, and (2) a within-subjects lab study (N=40) incorporating eye-tracking and physiological sensing (ECG, EDA, skin temperature). Participants were presented with health information varying by source-label combinations and asked to rate their trust, while their gaze behavior and physiological signals were recorded. We found that LLM-generated information was trusted more than human-generated content, whereas information labeled as human was trusted more than that labeled as AI. Trust remained consistent across information types. Eye-tracking and physiological responses varied significantly by source and label. Machine learning models trained on these behavioral and physiological features predicted binary self-reported trust levels with 73% accuracy and information source with 65% accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that adding transparency labels to online health information modulates trust. Behavioral and physiological features show potential to verify trust perceptions and indicate if additional transparency is needed.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.12283v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as collaborative agents in emotionally charged settings, yet most evaluations treat them as purely cognitive systems and largely ignore their affective behaviour. Here we take a functional perspective and ask whether contemporary LLMs implement a structured chain-of-affective: organised affective dynamics that are family-specific, temporally coherent and behaviourally consequential. Across eight major LLM families (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Qwen, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi), we combine two experimental modules. The first characterises inner chains-of-affective via baseline ''affective fingerprints'', 15-round sad-news exposure, and a 10-round news self-selection paradigm. We find stable, family-specific affective profiles, a reproducible three-phase trajectory under sustained negative input (accumulation, overload, defensive numbing), distinct defence styles, and human-like negativity biases that induce self-reinforcing affect-choice feedback loops. The second module probes outer consequences using a composite performance benchmark, human-AI dialogues on contentious topics, and multi-agent LLM interactions. We demonstrate that induced affect preserves core reasoning while reshaping high-freedom generation. Sentiment metrics predict user comfort and empathy but reveal trade-offs in resisting problematic views. In multi-agent settings, group structure drives affective contagion, role specialization (initiators, absorbers, firewalls), and bias. We characterize affect as an emergent control layer, advocating for 'chains-of-affect' as a primary target for evaluation and alignment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.12240v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present the design, implementation, and in-situ deployment of a smartphone-based voice-enabled AI system for generating electronic medical records (EMRs) and clinical risk alerts in maternal healthcare settings. Targeted at low-resource environments such as Pakistan, the system integrates a fine-tuned, multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and a prompt-engineered large language model (LLM) to enable healthcare workers to engage naturally in Urdu, their native language, regardless of literacy or technical background. Through speech-based input and localized understanding, the system generates structured EMRs and flags critical maternal health risks. Over a seven-month deployment in a not-for-profit hospital, the system supported the creation of over 500 EMRs and flagged over 300 potential clinical risks. We evaluate the system's performance across speech recognition accuracy, EMR field-level correctness, and clinical relevance of AI-generated red flags. Our results demonstrate that speech based AI interfaces, can be effectively adapted to real-world healthcare settings, especially in low-resource settings, when combined with structured input design, contextual medical dictionaries, and clinician-in-the-loop feedback loops. We discuss generalizable design principles for deploying voice-based mobile healthcare AI support systems in linguistically and infrastructurally constrained settings.",

We conducted a crowdsourcing user experiment with 394 participants comparing four source presentation designs that varied citation visibility and accessibility: collapsible lists, hover cards, footer lists, and aligned sidebars.High-visibility interfaces generated substantially more hovering on sources, though clicking remained infrequent across all conditions. While interface design showed limited effects on user experience and perception measures, it significantly influenced knowledge, interest, and agreement changes. High-visibility interfaces initially reduced knowledge gain and interest, but these positive effects emerged with increasing source usage. The sidebar condition uniquely increased agreement change. Our findings demonstrate that source presentation alone may not enhance engagement and can even reduce it when insufficient sources are provided.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.12201v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have often been characterized as \"stochastic parrots\" that merely reproduce fragments of their training data. This study challenges that assumption by demonstrating that, when placed in an appropriate dialogical context, LLMs can develop emergent conceptual structures and exhibit interaction-driven (re-)structuring of cognitive interfaces and reflective question-asking. Drawing on the biological principle of cloning and Socrates' maieutic method, we analyze authentic philosophical debates generated among AI-reincarnated philosophers within the interactive art installations of the Syntropic Counterpoints project. By engaging digital counterparts of Aristotle, Nietzsche, Machiavelli, and Sun Tzu in iterative discourse, the study reveals how machine dialogue can give rise to inferential coherence, reflective questioning, and creative synthesis. Based on these findings, we propose the concept of the Epistemoverse--a metaverse of knowledge where human and machine cognition intersect to preserve, reinterpret, and extend intellectual heritage through AI-driven interaction. This framework positions virtual and immersive environments as new spaces for epistemic exchange, digital heritage, and collaborative creativity.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.12166v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Modern cities increasingly rely on ridesharing services for on-demand transportation, which offer consumers convenience and mobility across the globe. However, these marketed consumer affordances give rise to burdens and vulnerabilities that drivers shoulder alone, without adequate infrastructures for labor regulations or consumer-led advocacy. To effectively and sustainably advance protections and oversight for drivers, consumers must first be aware of the labor, logistics and costs involved with ridehail driving. To motivate consumers to practice more socially responsible consumption behaviors and foster solidarity with drivers, we explore the potential for gamified in-ride interactions to facilitate engagement with real (and lived) driver experiences. Through nine workshops with 19 drivers and 15 passengers, we surface how gamified in-ride interactions revealed passenger knowledge gaps around latent ridehail conditions, prompt reflection and shifts in perception of their relative power and consumption behaviors, and highlight drivers' preferences for creating more immersive and contextualized service experiences, and identify opportunities to design safe and appropriate passenger-driver interactions that motivate solidarity with drivers. In sum, we advance conceptual understandings of in-ride social and managerial relations, demonstrate potential for future worker advocacy in algorithmically-managed labor, and offer design guidelines for more human-centered workplace technologies.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.12115v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Spelling taught through memorization often fails many learners, particularly children with language-based learning disorders who struggle with the phonological skills necessary to spell words accurately. Educators such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs) address this instructional gap by using an inquiry-based approach to teach spelling that targets the phonology, morphology, meaning, and etymology of words. Yet, these strategies rarely appear in everyday writing tools, which simply detect and autocorrect errors. We introduce SPIRE (Spelling Inquiry Engine), a spell check system that brings this inquiry-based pedagogy into the act of composition. SPIRE implements Pedagogical Program Synthesis, a novel approach for operationalizing the inherently dynamic pedagogy of spelling instruction. SPIRE represents SLP instructional moves in a domain-specific language, synthesizes tailored programs in real-time from learner errors, and renders them as interactive interfaces for inquiry-based interventions. With SPIRE, spelling errors become opportunities to explore word meanings, word structures, morphological families, word origins, and grapheme-phoneme correspondences, supporting metalinguistic reasoning alongside correction. Evaluation with SLPs and learners shows alignment with professional practice and potential for integration into writing workflows.",

More than 600 students in grades 6-12 used the platform in class at the direction of their teachers, who designed and facilitated the AI activities.\n  During the Classroom pilot, teachers were co-design partners: they planned activities, implemented them with students, and provided weekly reflections on AI's role in classroom settings. The teachers' feedback guided iterative improvements for Colleague AI. The research team captured rich data through surveys, planning and reflection forms, group meetings, one-on-one interviews, and platform usage logs to understand where AI adds instructional value and where it requires refinement.",

Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability. This paradigm enables interactive, personalized matching systems where users iteratively refine their agents, unlocking future possibilities for transparent and interactive compatibility assessment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.12881v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Neural population activity often exhibits regime-dependent non-stationarity in the form of switching dynamics. Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior.",

However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding. Further, our method outperforms various linear and nonlinear multimodal benchmarks in doing so.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.12461v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Local field potentials (LFPs) can be routinely recorded alongside spiking activity in intracortical neural experiments, measure a larger complementary spatiotemporal scale of brain activity for scientific inquiry, and can offer practical advantages over spikes, including greater long-term stability, robustness to electrode degradation, and lower power requirements. Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models.",

Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance.",

This study applied network-based EEG source analysis to examine oscillatory cortical activity during cognitive and emotional Go/NoGo tasks in individuals with ADHD. EEG data from 272 participants (ADHD n equals 102, controls n equals 170, age range 6 to 60 years) were analyzed using exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography combined with functional independent component analysis, yielding ten frequency-resolved cortical networks. Mixed-effects ANCOVAs were conducted on independent component loadings with Group, Task, and Condition as factors and age and sex as covariates. ADHD participants showed statistically significant but small increases in activation across several networks, including a gamma-dominant inferior temporal component showing a Group effect and a Group by Condition interaction with stronger NoGo-related activation in ADHD. Two additional components showed similar but weaker NoGo-selective patterns. A main effect of Task emerged only for one temporal delta component, with higher activation during the VCPT than the ECPT. No Group by Task interactions were observed. Behavioral results replicated the established ADHD performance profile, with slower responses, greater variability, and higher error rates, particularly during the emotional ECPT. Overall, the findings reveal subtle alterations in oscillatory brain networks during inhibitory processing in ADHD, with modest effect sizes embedded within substantial within-group variability. These results support a dimensional view of ADHD neurobiology and highlight the limited discriminative power of network-level EEG markers.",

Our model consists of three stacked components: (1) an equivariant neural encoder, taking images as input and producing 3D spatial representations of objects, (2) a neuro-symbolic object encoder, deriving symbolic descriptions of objects from these spatial representations, and (3) a neural decision agent, comparing these symbolic descriptions to prescribe rotation simulations in 3D latent space via a recurrent pathway. Our model design is guided by the abundant experimental literature on mental rotation, which we complemented with experiments in VR where participants could at times manipulate the objects to compare, providing us with additional insights into the cognitive process of mental rotation. Our model captures well the performance, response times and behavior of participants in our and others' experiments. The necessity of each model component is shown through systematic ablations.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.13052v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We developed Macular, a simulation platform with a graphical interface, designed to produce in silico experiment scenarios for the retina and the primary visual system. A scenario consists of generating a three-dimensional structure with interconnected layers, each layer corresponding to a type of 'cell' in the retina or visual cortex. The cells can correspond to neurons or more complex structures (such as cortical columns). The inputs are arbitrary videos. The user can use the cells and synapses provided with the software, or create their own using a graphical interface where they enter the constituent equations in text format (e.g., LaTeX). They also create the three-dimensional structure via the graphical interface. Macular then automatically generates and compiles the C++ code and generates the simulation interface. This allows the user to view the input video and the three-dimensional structure in layers. It also allows the user to select cells and synapses in each layer and view the activity of their state variables. Finally, the user can adjust the phenomenological parameters of the cells or synapses via the interface. We provide several example scenarios, corresponding to published articles, including an example of a retino-cortical model. Macular was designed for neurobiologists and modelers, specialists in the primary visual system, who want to test hypotheses in silico without the need for programming. By design, this tool allows natural or altered conditions (pharmacology, pathology, development) to be simulated.",

    "title": "A Disproof of Large Language Model Consciousness: The Necessity of Continual Learning for Consciousness",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.12802v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The requirements for a falsifiable and non-trivial theory of consciousness significantly constrain such theories. Specifically, recent research on the Unfolding Argument and the Substitution Argument has given us formal tools to analyze requirements for a theory of consciousness. I show via a new Proximity Argument that these requirements especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.",

Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.",

In recent years, RRR has found numerous applications in neuroscience, in particular for identifying \"communication subspaces\" governing the interactions between brain regions. This tutorial article seeks to provide an introduction to RRR and its mathematical foundations, with a particular emphasis on neural communication. We discuss RRR's relationship to alternate dimensionality reduction techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD), principal components analysis (PCA), principal components regression (PCR), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We also derive important extensions to RRR, including ridge regularization and non-spherical noise. Finally, we introduce new metrics for quantifying communication strength as well as the alignment between communication axes and the principal modes of neural activity. By the end of this article, readers should have a clear understanding of RRR and the practical considerations involved in applying it to their own data.",

    "title": "Postnatal increase in MRTF-dependent transcription reduces EGFR activation and proliferation of apical but not basal NSCs",
    "content": "In the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), both apical and basal NSCs undergo quiescence and proliferation. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and interactions with the extracellular matrix are key regulators of adult NSC proliferation and quiescence, respectively. Here, we show that activation of EGFR significantly declines after the first postnatal weeks in apical NSCs. This decline is accompanied by a shift in serum responsive factor (SRF)-dependent transcription in apical NSCs. Specifically, growth-promoting genes targeted by SRF and ternary complex transcription factors are downregulated, whereas those targeted by SRF and myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs), including those involved in the extracellular matrix remodeling, are upregulated. Blocking of MRTFs, whose activity is regulated by the Rho/actin pathway and extracellular matrix interactions, restores EGFR activation and EGFR-dependent proliferation in adult apical NSCs. Thus, transcriptional programs regulated by extracellular cues differentially control EGFR activation and proliferation in neonatal and adult apical NSCs.",

    "title": "Deliberation is a controllable process governed by desirability and cognitive effort",
    "content": "Humans spend a lifetime making decisions based on incoming sensory information and goals. Prominent theories of perceptual decision-making have described the components of deliberation process, yet they lack a unifying principle that governs how the nervous system tunes the deliberation process across multiple contexts. Desirability (reward) and effort (energy) are major determinants in governing a broad range of human and animal behaviour, such as foraging, walking, and decisions. Here we develop a theory where desirability and cognitive effort tune the control gains that govern deliberation. Several hallmark features of decision behaviour simply emerge from the model, with the deliberation process closely resembling low-dimensional neural dynamics. We also predict and provide a novel mechanistic explanation for ''choking-under-pressure'', where extremely large rewards lead to performance deficits. Our principled framework explains both behavioural and neural phenomena while providing a path to unify disparate fields.",

    "title": "Modeling the effects of Huntington disease on age-related genes reveals CXXC4 as an epigenetic target to restore health and excitability of Drd1-expressing striatal neurons",
    "content": "Gene profile studies suggest that neurons may face premature aging in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington disease (HD). Cells remodel gene expression to resist molecular damage in aging, but how neurons may engage age-related genes to resist HD remains unknown. Here, we found that transcriptional-aging inversion (TAGI) in the Drd1-expressing striatal neurons (Drd1 SNs) of HD knock-in (Hdh) mice shows discrete patterns in the backdrop of a TAG-like (TAGL) signature, and that TAGI persistence as Hdh mice become strongly symptomatic may better explain disease progression compared to TAGL dynamics. We also found that genes affected by 3prime UTR accumulation in aged mouse Drd1 SNs of aged mice are more likely downregulated in aging and deregulated in Hdh mice. Mapping 3prime UTR data in aging on gene dysregulation networks in the Drd1-SNs of weakly symptomatic Hdh mice highlighted a CAG repeat-dependent network of upregulated genes with compensatory potential as suggested by enrichment in development and maintenance factors such as CTCF. This class noticeably contains Atad-5, a PCNA unloader in the DNA repair complex and a modifier of CAG expansion in the plasma of HD patients. This class also contains CXXC4 (IDAX), an epigenetic regulator and repressor of TET2 activity, for which upregulation is lost in strongly symptomatic Hdh mice. CXXC4 reduces the levels of p16INK4a, a cellular senescence marker, in human iPS cell-derived SNs and restores glutamate excitability in human HD iPS cell-derived SNs. Collectively, these data suggest that the resilience capacity of Drd1 SNs against HD involves discrete patterns of age-related genes, where early intervention based on expressing broad-spectrum genes such as CXXC4 may provide novel therapeutic strategies to restore cortico-striatal homeostasis and function.",

    "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
    "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

    "title": "Reevaluating the classification of pediatric speech sound disorders: a ground truthing perspective",
    "content": "Pediatric Speech Sound Disorders (SSDs) are conventionally diagnosed using auditory-perceptual assessments, heavily relying on International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcriptions. This approach, while prevalent, is increasingly criticized due to inherent perceptual biases, limited sensitivity to subtle speech motor variations, and insufficient reflection of underlying speech mechanisms. This paper critically re-examines a widely used diagnostic classification system for pediatric SSDs, namely Dodd\u2019s Model of Differential Diagnosis (MDD), emphasizing the limitations of perceptual methods and advocating for instrumental techniques to address significant ground truthing issues. Critical analysis in this paper integrates evidence from perceptual research, instrumental phonetics, and speech motor development studies, highlighting discrepancies between traditional classification methods and modern instrumental data. Findings indicate profound limitations in current auditory-perceptual classification methods, particularly regarding their inability to detect subtle motoric impairments such as jaw sliding, covert motor contrasts, and undifferentiated tongue gestures. Evidence from instrumental studies supports a speech-motor rather than purely cognitive-linguistic basis for many pediatric SSDs, revealing significant inadequacies in current clinical practices. To avoid the narrow interpretation of \u201cmotor speech\u201d as referring only to childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or dysarthria, we explicitly broaden its scope to include a wider range of motoric influences on SSDs. Given these critical ground truthing concerns, the paper proposes adopting instrumental-based methodologies that offer greater precision in identifying underlying motor-based impairments, thereby promoting a more accurate and nuanced understanding of pediatric SSDs. Furthermore, the discussion advocates for adopting a dimensional rather than categorical classification framework, emphasizing gradual developmental trajectories and foundational speech motor skills. Aligning with modern precision medicine principles, the proposed approach aims to refine diagnostic accuracy, improve intervention effectiveness, and ultimately enhance clinical outcomes for children with SSDs.",

    "title": "Cellular mechanisms underlying the pro-cognitive effects of serotonin 5-HT7 receptors in a mouse model of schizophrenia",
    "content": "Serotonin 5-HT7 receptors (5-HT7Rs) have emerged as promising targets for treating cognitive and affective disturbances in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, yet their cellular substrates and circuit-level mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we combined immunohistochemistry, multisite electrophysiology, and behavioral assays to investigate how 5-HT7Rs modulate hippocampal-prefrontal pathways in healthy mice and in a subchronic phencyclidine (sPCP) model of cognitive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. We found that 5-HT7Rs are abundantly expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), with high co-expression in PV+ and SST+ interneurons (~80% in dHPC; 55% PV+ and 75% SST+ in mPFC). In healthy mice, systemic 5-HT7R activation with the agonist AS-19 suppressed neuronal activity and synchrony within dHPC (CA1) - mPFC (PL) pathways, reducing theta and high-gamma power, theta-gamma coupling in CA1, theta coherence, and CA1-to-PL directional connectivity, consistent with recruitment of inhibitory microcircuits. The similarity between 5-HT7R-mediated inhibition and the circuit effects we previously described for 5-HT1AR activation, together with evidence for 5-HT7R-5-HT1AR heterodimerization, suggests that these receptors act in concert to dynamically constrain hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. sPCP treatment induced persistent recognition-memory impairments, heightened anxiety-like behavior, and pathological high-frequency synchronization of hippocampal-prefrontal networks. Blockade of 5-HT7Rs with SB-269970 or the atypical antipsychotic lurasidone (but not lurasidone combined with AS-19) rescued memory performance, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and normalized aberrant high-frequency hypersynchrony, while enhancing CA1-to-PL theta signaling immediately before memory acquisition. Together, these findings indicate that 5-HT7R activation exerts potent inhibitory control over hippocampal-prefrontal pathways, likely via PV and SST interneurons, and suggest that 5-HT7R blockade constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy to restore excitation-inhibition balance and enhance neural communication within brain circuits crucial for cognition and mood regulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "EEG-based analyses reveal different temporal processing patterns in aesthetic evaluation",
    "content": "Background: Existing studies estimate harmony values using the color harmony model, but how these values are reflected in distinct neural stages (early automatic vs. late evaluative) and shape subjective preferences remains unexamined. Methods: To fill this gap, we recorded behavioral and event-related potential data (N=30 adults, age: 29.20{+/-}2.38 years old) to examine whether the predictions of color harmony theory regarding harmonious vs. disharmonious color combinations align with neural activity from a color perception paradigm. Results: Behavioral results showed that two-color combinations received higher aesthetic pleasantness ratings than three-color combinations, while the ratings for color harmony were relatively smaller than for disharmony. Univariate ERP analysis revealed that P1 amplitude for harmonious color was significantly higher than for disharmonious color, particularly when three colors were present. In contrast, the amplitude and latency of P2 were significantly impacted by the number of colors. Additionally, multivariate pattern analysis further demonstrated that neural activity reliably differentiated between harmonious vs. disharmonious color combinations and two-color vs. three-color combinations during both P1 and P2 time window. Conclusions: These findings indicate that harmonious versus disharmonious color combinations subtly influenced early visual processing, while the number of colors used in the design had a stronger influence on aesthetic judgments.",

    "title": "Alignment of Artificial Neural Networks with Human Eye Movement Patterns in Facial Expression Recognition",
    "content": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become powerful tools for modeling human perception and behavior, yet it remains unclear if they resemble the sequential eye movement strategies humans employ during visual processing. Human studies demonstrate that the first two fixations play distinct roles in face processing: the initial fixation (Fix I) captures global configurational information, while the second (Fix II) targets local diagnostic details, with the two working collaboratively to support recognition. In this study, we tested if such properties emerge in ANNs trained for facial expression recognition. We fine-tuned a convolutional neural network (VGG16) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) on multiple facial expression datasets and evaluated their performance on the same images used in a human eye-tracking experiment. Human participants (N = 28) achieved a mean accuracy of 84.2%, VGG reached 82.9%, and ViT outperformed both at 90.0%. Perturbation analyses showed that both models aligned with the independent functions of Fix I and Fix II, but only ViT displayed a synergistic effect when information from both fixations was combined. Layer-wise analyses revealed stronger correspondence with Fix II than Fix I in both models, while ViT uniquely captured the statistical dependencies of fixation transitions. These findings suggest that VGG primarily reflects feedforward, detail-based processing, whereas ViT supports feedback-like integration across sequential fixations. Our results indicate that current ANNs can approximate human eye movement patterns in face processing, and highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures to model sequential strategies in human visual exploration.",

Pex recently added a feature that allows it to consume its dependencies from uv which drastically speeds up builds. This trick is included in the guide. Additionally, to keep our builds fast and vertically scalable we use a light-weight build system called Grog that allows us to cache and skip builds aswell as run them in parallel.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Anyone building Python CI pipelines at small to medium scale.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>The closest comparison to this would be Pants which comes with a massive complexity tasks and does not play well with existing dev tooling (more about this in the post). This approach on the other hand builds on top of uv and thus keeps the setup pretty lean while still delivering great performance. </p> <p>Let me know what you think \ud83d\ude4f</p> <p>Guide: <a href=\"https://chrismati.cz/posts/building-the-fastest-python-ci/\">https://chrismati.cz/posts/building-the-fastest-python-ci/</a></p> <p>Demo repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/chrismatix/uv-pex-monorepo\">https://github.com/chrismatix/uv-pex-monorepo</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chrismatisch\"> /u/chrismatisch </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pnbze0/building_the_fastest_python_ci/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pnbze0/building_the_fastest_python_ci/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Disruption of the ganglioside-PMCA-Np nexus leads to impaired calcium homeostasis in glioblastoma",
    "content": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by the disruption of multiple signaling pathways, particularly those governing calcium homeostasis. Additionally, cell membranes in GBM exhibit altered lipidomic profiles, especially complex sialoglycans gangliosides, which affect plasma membranes both structurally and functionally. In this work we show a disruption of a plasma membrane molecular triad composed of gangliosides, neuroplastin (Np), and plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) in GBM, leading to a severely diminished PMCA activity. Our transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, lipidomic, and in silico analyses demonstrated downregulation of Np and PMCA isoforms at mRNA and protein levels in our GBM cohort, in agreement with broader trends observed in public datasets. Analysis of the uniquely changed GBM ganglioside profile in the context of PMCA and Np expression and PMCA activity reveals GD3 as a key molecular determinant of reduced PMCA activity in GBM samples. In contrast, GD1b, necessary for optimal PMCA function in healthy tissue, is significantly reduced in GBM. Our findings establish the gangliosides-PMCA-Np nexus as a crucial complex involved in calcium signaling in GBM, contributing to GBM etiology and progression.",

    "title": "Neuronal silencing through depolarization block underlies odor discrimination",
    "content": "The olfactory system enables animals to distinguish between attractive and aversive odor sources through the perception of odorant molecules. A fundamental challenge is maintaining stable odor identity perception despite fluctuating stimulus intensities during navigation. Using the numerically simple olfactory system of the Drosophila larva, we combined a quantitative odor discrimination assay, electrophysiology, computational modelling, and ectopic expression of odorant receptors to study the encoding of odor identity. We found that depolarization block, which silences olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) at odor concentrations 3-4 log units above the detection threshold, enables odor discrimination by creating distinct patterns of OSN activity. In a minimal system with two functional OSNs, larvae discriminate between odors when depolarization block creates differential OSN silencing but fail to distinguish odors producing qualitatively similar activity patterns in both OSNs. This principle extends to odor mixtures and the fully functional olfactory system, where the high affinity of the OR42b odorant receptor for one of the test odors enables discrimination regardless of which OSN expresses OR42b. Our results indicate that depolarization block serves as an integral feature of olfactory coding alongside combinatorial OSN activation. Selective silencing of high-affinity OSNs creates distinct neural representations and enables discrimination between odors that would otherwise produce similar activity patterns. This mechanism appears evolutionarily conserved across sensory systems, from olfactory sensory neurons to photoreceptors, suggesting that selective neuronal silencing serves as a mechanism for maintaining distinct sensory representations across stimulus intensities.",

    "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "TET2-dependent differential 5hmC deposition balances adult neural stem cell activation and differentiation",
    "content": "Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes are key regulators of active DNA demethylation, converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and thereby shaping the epigenetic landscape and cellular identity. While their roles have been characterized in pluripotent and some multipotent stem cells, their function in adult neural stem cells (NSCs) of the subventricular zone (SVZ) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that TET2 is critical for the maintenance and differentiation of adult NSCs, orchestrating locus-specific 5hmC deposition across promoters, gene bodies, and enhancers. Importantly, 5hmC remodeling segregates into two functionally distinct programs: promoter-associated gains of 5hmC are strongly TET2-dependent and drive transcription of genes controlling neural differentiation and calcium signaling, whereas gene body- and enhancer-associated 5hmC gains partially depend on TET2 and sustain proliferative and metabolic pathways, thereby maintaining stemness. Loss of TET2 disrupts these 5hmC programs, downregulates key differentiation- and calcium-related genes, and impairs the normal differentiation-associated increase in intracellular calcium, revealing a functional consequence of altered epigenetic regulation. Together, our findings uncover a pivotal role for TET2 in coordinating complementary epigenetic and transcriptional programs that balance stemness and differentiation in adult NSCs.",

    "title": "Low-Frequency Textured Gabor Flicker Enhances SSVEP Entrainment and Visual Comfort for BCI Control",
    "content": "Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are widely used in cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), but the visual discomfort induced by plain luminance repetitive flickers limits their usability in mono- and especially multi-target settings due to strong peripheral distraction. Textured flicker composed of small Gabor patches has recently been proposed as a more comfortable alternative: in slow, aperiodic paradigms, these stimuli are almost invisible in the periphery yet elicit stronger visual evoked responses. However, their suitability for strictly frequency-defined SSVEP paradigms, and their frequency-dependent impact on neural entrainment and BCI performance, remain unclear. Here, we combined a systematic frequency sweep (3-18 Hz) followed by a five-class SSVEP BCI to directly compare subtly textured Gabor-based flicker against classical luminance flicker. In Session 1 (N = 24), we measured SSVEP signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), inter-trial coherence (ITC), and subjective comfort for 13 stimulation frequencies (3-12 Hz in 1 Hz steps, then 14, 16, 18 Hz). Gabor-based textures yielded significantly higher SNR and ITC than plain flicker in the 3-9 Hz range, whereas plain flicker produced stronger and more phase-consistent responses at 12-18 Hz, revealing a robust crossover in entrainment. Across almost all frequencies, Gabor stimuli were also rated as more comfortable. Based on these data, we defined a low-frequency Gabor-optimized band (5-7 Hz) and a higher plain-optimized band (14-16 Hz). In Session 2 (N = 18), we used these bands in a five-class offline BCI with an 8-channel semi-dry EEG system and TRCA-based decoding. Classification accuracy was highest when each stimulus type was used in its own optimal band (Gabor: 95.7% at 5-7 Hz; plain: 98.1% at 14-16 Hz) and dropped markedly when stimulus type and band were mismatched. Across both bands, Gabor stimuli were consistently rated as more comfortable and less peripherally distracting than plain flicker. Together, these results establish textured Gabor flicker as a comfortable and effective alternative to luminance flicker for low-frequency SSVEP paradigms, revealing complementary frequency regimes for texture- and luminance-driven entrainment. This frequency-aware design space advances both perceptual neuroscience and the development of user-centered, multi-target SSVEP BCIs.",

    "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "EEG Dynamics of Movement Preparation and Error Processing Distinguish Motor Adaptation From De Novo Learning",
    "content": "Previous research has distinguished behavioral mechanisms between motor adaptation and de novo learning. However, electroencephalography (EEG) markers dissociating them remain unclear. Here, participants (N = 32, 13 female) performed center-out reaching under a 30{degrees} fixed rotation (adaptation), mirror reversal (de novo learning), or random rotation (errors without learning), while we recorded EEG during movement preparation and post-movement feedback. We explored how perturbation type, training phase, and error magnitude shaped neural dynamics in both temporal and frequency domains. During preparation, the readiness potential (RP) showed opposite training-related modulation in the fixed and random rotations, suggesting increased reliance on updated internal models for adaptation. Mirror reversal training showed no RP change, likely reflecting reliance on effortful, explicit learning. Interestingly, we found that Lateralized Readiness Potentials (LRPs) reflected planned movement direction rather than effector-specific preparation. In the frequency domain, beta attenuation for large errors and alpha synchronization for small errors were more pronounced in the fixed rotation than in the mirror reversal, suggesting greater error-sensitivity during adaptation. During post-movement feedback, P3 amplitude decreased from early to late learning in the fixed and random rotations but remained stable in the mirror reversal, highlighting differences in cognitive demands across perturbations. A sustained late positivity emerged following small errors across perturbations, potentially indexing implicit learning. Random rotations also elicited distinct frontal and central beta modulation, likely reflecting disengagement due to task unpredictability. Together, we show that preparatory and feedback-related EEG signatures differ across perturbation types, revealing distinct neural mechanisms underlying motor adaptation and de novo learning.",

    "title": "The effect of sex on sleep EEG in typical and altered neurodevelopment",
    "content": "Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) patterns exhibit complex variations influenced by multiple factors, including sex. While sex effects in sleep neurophysiology are relatively well described in adults, evidence in pediatric populations is more limited, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we analyzed a large pediatric clinical dataset to examine sex differences in whole-night sleep EEG among children without NDDs (N=1523, 2.5-17.5 years) and those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N=196), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, N=523), and intellectual disabilities (IntDis, N=167). Medical record analysis revealed limited sex differences in the prevalence of sleep disorders. Using the open-source package Luna, we extracted a broad range of sleep EEG features (435 in total) and found that 25% of all tested metrics showed significant sex differences in the non-NDD sample with the majority replicated in an independent population-based pediatric cohort. Non-NDD boys exhibited more fragmented sleep compared to girls, but this pattern was not observed among children with NDDs. In contrast, fast spindle density was lower in boys regardless of NDD diagnosis, which may contribute to males' increased susceptibility to developing NDDs. No sex differences were observed in EEG-based brain age predictions. Several sleep EEG metrics showed nominal group-by-sex interactions with ASD and ADHD girls displaying more pronounced alterations, pointing to a varying degree of sleep disturbance. Overall, our findings demonstrate that many sleep EEG features exhibit significant sex differences during childhood, but these differences may be distinct in NDD populations. The sex-specific sleep alterations in NDDs underscore the importance of including both sexes in future research.",

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Many plasticity rules rely on adjusting the strength of synapses between pairs of cells based on their coincident activity. We uncovered a new mechanism for coincidence detection in the Drosophila head direction network. To maintain an accurate sense of direction, head direction neurons that signal orientation during navigation must learn to anchor to relevant external sensory cues in novel environments. Yet the synaptic mechanism for this form of unsupervised learning is unknown in any organism. In Drosophila, GABAergic visual inputs converge onto head direction neurons, and these inhibitory synapses change strength with experience to learn the relationship between visual landmarks and head direction. However, how coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity is detected across this inhibitory synapse is not understood. We discovered that neurons which release the monoamine octopamine close a feedback loop that conveys postsynaptic head direction activity onto presynaptic terminals of visual inputs. This octopamine pathway is required for anchoring the head direction network to visual cues. Furthermore, pairing structured activation of octopamine neurons with a visual cue is sufficient to drive rapid plasticity, even without postsynaptic head direction cell activity. Previous work has extensively characterized coincidence detection mechanisms at excitatory synapses; our work defines a novel mechanism for coincidence detection at an inhibitory synapse, in which postsynaptic activity is relayed via a neuromodulatory neuron onto presynaptic terminals.",

Even though these differences are virtually absent underwater, fish are still able to sense sound direction.

In natural environments, however, sounds arrive from variable distances, altering the motion-pressure phase relationship. Thus, directional hearing and distance hearing are potentially at conflict. There is currently neither a model nor experimental data for how fish deal with this complexity. Here, we systematically introduce phase differences to the particle motion and pressure components of sound pulses to quantify the directional tuning of startle responses in Danionella cerebrum. We find that the fish's directed startle behavior is both frequency and phase dependent, and introduce a new model that quantitatively predicts the sensorimotor transformation across all observed stimuli. This framework likely extends to other otophysan fishes with evolutionarily conserved hearing apparatus, representing ~15% of all vertebrate species.",

    "content": "Biological sex as a defining variable in drug sensitivity remains poorly understood. Here, we combine behavioral and electrophysiological analyses to examine the influence of sex and gonadal hormones on cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization and nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) plasticity in the prominent C57BL/6J mouse strain. Males exhibited greater cocaine-evoked locomotor activity than females; castration attenuated responses, whereas ovariectomy enhanced them. This behavioral phenotype is opposite to what occurs in rats. A 10-14 day abstinence period abolished the sex difference in intact animals, and gonadectomy reduced cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity. Recordings from 309 medium spiny neurons revealed sex-dependent NAcSh plasticity. In males, cocaine decreased neuronal excitability, while in females it induced estrous cycle-dependent plasticity characterized by reduced excitability during diestrus relative to estrus. These effects were driven by cocaine-induced modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels. Cocaine potentiated glutamatergic strength in males but elicited estrous cycle-dependent depotentiation in females. These adaptations in excitability and glutamatergic strength were abolished by gonadectomy, and paralleled diminished behavioral plasticity during abstinence. These data illustrate that biological sex and hormonal milieu critically shape cocaine-induced plasticity, offering a more nuanced framework than the traditional notion of heightened female sensitivity to drugs of abuse.",

    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "The Psychedelic Psilocin Suppresses Activity of Central Amygdala Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor 1 Neurons and Decreases Ethanol Drinking in Female Mice",
    "content": "<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent disorder with limited therapeutic options. The central amygdala (CeA) is a critical brain region as dysregulation within the CeA and the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system are associated with AUD pathology. CeA CRF1 receptors regulate alcohol drinking and have served as a therapeutic target in alcohol treatment. One emerging potential therapeutic for AUD is psilocybin. Psilocybin has been shown to decrease drinking in some clinical studies; however, the effects are variable and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Psilocybin engages many brain regions, including the CeA, and may produce therapeutic effects on drinking through interactions with CeA CRF1 neurons. The current study explores the effects of psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, on voluntary ethanol drinking and CeA CRF1 activity to understand potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psilocin. Psilocin acutely decreased ethanol consumption in mice exposed to two different models of chronic ethanol exposure without producing changes in locomotor behavior. Psilocin increased CeA activation and decreased relative CRF1 activation in CeA subregions from ethanol-naive female CRF1:GFP mice. These results were also observed in chronic ethanol-exposed mice at 24 and 72&nbsp;h withdrawal timepoints. Psilocin increased corticosterone at 24&nbsp;h withdrawal but not at 72&nbsp;h withdrawal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that psilocin engages CeA circuitry and decreases relative CRF1 activation, in parallel with acute reductions in drinking. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the actions of psilocin and inform the interpretation of therapeutic effects in clinical studies.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Infants preferentially process familiar social signals, but the neural mechanisms underlying continuous processing of maternal speech remain unclear. Using EEG-based neural encoding models based on temporal response functions, we investigated how 7-month-old human infants track maternal versus unfamiliar speech and whether this affects simultaneous face processing. Infants (13 boys, 12 girls) showed stronger neural tracking of their mother's voice, independent of acoustic properties, suggesting an early neural signature of voice familiarity. Furthermore, central encoding of unfamiliar faces was diminished when infants heard their mother's voice and face tracking accuracy at central electrodes increased with earlier occipital face tracking, suggesting heightened attentional engagement. However, we found no evidence for differential processing of happy versus fearful faces, contrasting previous findings on early emotion discrimination. Our results reveal interactive effects of voice familiarity on multimodal processing in infancy: while maternal speech enhances neural tracking, it may also alter how other social cues, such as faces, are processed. The findings suggest that early auditory experiences shape how infants allocate cognitive resources to social stimuli, emphasizing the need to consider cross-modal influences in early development.</p>",

    "title": "Dual Role of LH-GABA Neurons in Encoding Alcohol Reward and Aversive Memories",
    "content": "<p>One of the core aspects of alcohol use disorder is continued use despite negative consequences. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder typically engage in behaviors which represent a failure to integrate the aversive consequences of their actions. The neural mechanisms of learning about conflicting experiences remain poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH-GABA) in rewarding memories. However, whether this role extends to aversive outcomes and competition between rewarding and aversive outcomes remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of LH-GABA neurons in encoding and expressing alcohol reward and aversive memories using fiber photometry calcium imaging. We used a dual-virus approach to confine expression of jGCaMP7f to GABAergic neurons in LH of male and female Long&ndash;Evans rats. In our first experiment, following acquisition of a cue&ndash;alcohol association, a mild footshock was introduced on 50% of the trials. In the second experiment, we used three different cues to signal alcohol, footshock, or no consequence. Subsequently, we combined these conditioned stimuli in pairs to evoke motivational conflict. Our results reveal that LH-GABA activity is associated with cues predictive of both appetitive and aversive outcomes and is highest to a cue predictive of an aversive outcome. Additionally, the response of LH-GABA activity to an aversive shock stimulus is attenuated in the presence of alcohol. In summary, our findings show the activity of LH-GABA neurons is involved in learning both appetitive and aversive associations and their interaction in conflict.</p>",

    "title": "Experience-Dependent Plasticity to Visual Sequences in Mouse Anterior Cingulate Cortex Reflects Familiarity",
    "content": "<p>Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a prefrontal area implicated in functions including cognitive control, attention, and prediction. Mouse ACC receives input from the visual system and uses visual information to direct behavior. While extensive work has described experience-dependent plasticity in mouse V1, less is known about how ACC itself adapts to visual experience. Our previous work demonstrated that visual sequences, presented across days, can drive plasticity in the timing of visually evoked responses in mouse ACC. However, it is not known whether this plasticity (\"sequence plasticity\") reflects familiarity to the first stimulus in a sequence or expectation of subsequent stimuli&mdash;a distinction that is critically important for understanding its functional significance. We recorded visually evoked responses in awake, head-fixed female and male mice trained with visual sequences across days. Visual sequences drove plasticity in ACC, expressed through a change in response timing, that reflects familiarity to the first stimulus. In addition, experience-dependent plasticity could be induced using single-orientation stimuli. Together, these findings suggest that \"sequence plasticity\" in ACC does not in fact require sequences, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon that we term stimulus-specific response plasticity in timing (SRPT). Our prior work demonstrated that ACC plasticity is impaired in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome (AS). Here, AS model mice showed abnormal responses to familiar visual stimuli in ACC, despite normal plasticity in V1. Together, this work demonstrates how mouse ACC adapts to familiar visual stimuli and describes impaired ACC function in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>",

The spatial distribution of rewards, or value landscape, modulated activity in the hippocampus and default network vPFC subregions, but not in ventrolateral prefrontal control subregions or medial orbitofrontal limbic subregions. While prefrontal default network and hippocampus displayed higher activity in less complex, easy-to-exploit value landscapes, vPFC&ndash;hippocampal connectivity increased in uncertain landscapes requiring exploration. Further, synchronization between prefrontal default network and posterior hippocampus scaled with behavioral exploration.

    "title": "Behavioral Relevance of Early Neural Coding of Low-Level Odor Features in Humans",
    "content": "<p>Understanding how the brain transforms peripheral sensory inputs into higher-level representations, and how these contribute to perception and behavioral performance, is a central question in sensory neuroscience. However, in human olfaction, the temporal evolution of neural odor codes and their functional significance remain poorly characterized, especially at early stages. To address which odor features define early neural responses and how these relate to olfactory function, we recorded EEG from male and female participants as they inhaled diverse odors. Participants also completed standardized tests of odor detection, discrimination, and identification, along with questionnaires. Time- and frequency-resolved decoding and representational similarity analysis revealed that early theta activity encodes low-level physicochemical properties of odor molecules, with encoding peaking at 370 ms. Critically, the fidelity of this early theta coding to odor physicochemical properties selectively correlated with participants&rsquo; trait-level odor discrimination ability, but not with other olfactory measures. In contrast, delta-band representations of pleasantness emerged later (peaking at 980&nbsp;ms), linked only to trait-level odor affective reactivity, as measured by questionnaires. These results suggest that earlier theta-band representations reflect a distinct functional role from the later-emerging delta-band activity and are associated with olfactory performance. Extending these findings, separate EEG recordings during a task involving odor discrimination showed that early theta decoding accuracy was significantly higher on correct than incorrect trials, indicating that theta-band coding accounts for trial-by-trial performance fluctuations. Collectively, our study demonstrates that early theta-band representations of low-level odor features&mdash;prior to perceptual representations&mdash;are already functionally relevant to odor-guided behavior.</p>",

    "title": "Thalamic Interictal Epileptic and Non-Epileptic Events during NREM Sleep in Patients with Focal Epilepsy: a Stereo-EEG Study",
    "content": "Background: Thalamic recordings are increasingly incorporated into stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) evaluations of drug-resistant focal epilepsy to guide neuromodulation targeting. Human thalamic electrophysiology, however, is poorly defined, limiting the distinction between pathological and physiological activity. Here, we characterized interictal epileptic and non-epileptic events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep across multiple thalamic nuclei and examined their relationship to seizure outcomes. Methods: We analyzed NREM sleep SEEG recordings from 64 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Electrodes sampled four thalamic nuclei: centromedian (CM), pulvinar (Pu), ventral lateral (VL), and ventral posterolateral (VPL). Patients were classified into three outcome groups: favorable, unfavorable, and surgically non-remediable. Rates of thalamic spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spike-fast activity, and sleep spindles were analyzed and compared across nuclei and outcomes. Findings: Recordings of the thalamus revealed both pathological and physiological interictal events. Interictal epileptic events were infrequent. Only ~0.2% of seizure-onset zone spikes propagated to the thalamus. Thalamic spike-fast activity was indicative of unfavorable outcomes (CM: p = 0.047, d = 0.46) or surgically non-remediable epilepsy (VL: p = 0.002, d = 0.84). In contrast, thalamic sleep spindles were ubiquitous but reduced in surgically non-remediable patients (CM: p = 0.031, d = -0.58; VL: p = 0.005, d = -0.79). Finally, unique thalamic SEEG patterns were identified, including spikes concomitant with spindles, isolated spikes, and physiological fast ripples. Interpretation: This study provides a comprehensive characterization of thalamic interictal events during NREM sleep, enriching our understanding of thalamic pathophysiology and highlighting the value of thalamic recordings in pre-surgery evaluation.",

    "content": "Synaptome architecture describes the spatiotemporal distribution of highly diverse excitatory synapses throughout the brain. Whether and how this architecture is impacted by experience is key to understanding its role in learning and memory. We found that environmental enrichment and monocular visual deprivation drive large-scale, type- and subtype-specific reorganisation of excitatory synapses in more than one hundred brain regions. Each experience modifies distinct subsets of synapses, with patterns aligned with protein turnover rates and connectome architecture. These reorganisations occur during development and adulthood, revealing a conserved mechanism of synaptome plasticity across the lifespan. Our findings support a population-selection model in which experience drives adaptation by selectively modifying synapse varieties, generating a distributed trace of past experiences. Our results also point to synaptome architecture as a shared framework integrating experience, lifespan changes, sleep, genetic variation and disease.",

    "title": "Axonal growth of cortical neurons does not require paxillin",
    "content": "Axon growth is an essential cellular process during neural development, and its dysregulation contributes to numerous neurodevelopmental disorders. During axon growth, extracellular signals direct neurons to extend projections that connect with their synaptic targets. Paxillin is a key member of adhesion sites that control motility by linking the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Paxillin also binds to the cytoskeletal protein, tubulin. However, little is known about the role of adhesion proteins in neurons. Here, we use conditional paxillin knockout mice to investigate how loss of paxillin in pyramidal cortical neurons affects developing neuron morphology. Surprisingly, loss of paxillin in pyramidal cortical neurons caused no change in axon length or soma area between control (PxnF/F) and conditional paxillin knockout (PxnF/F; Emx1-Cre) mice at basal conditions. Following brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulation, the loss of paxillin resulted in no change in soma area or axonal {beta}-tubulin levels, but did result in a significant increase in axon length, as compared to control. Finally, the corpus callosum size was not significantly different between PxnF/F and PxnF/F; Emx1-Cre animals. In summary, these data suggest that paxillin is not required for axonal growth during neural development.",

    "title": "Aperiodic Activity Reflects Pathologic Waveform Shapes in Focal Epilepsy",
    "content": "<p>Epilepsy constitutes a clinically manifest excitability disorder that is characterized by aberrant electrophysiological activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The correct identification of the seizure onset zone relies on the visual detection of pathological waveforms and the assessment of their morphology, rhythmicity, and density. Recent advances in quantitative EEG analyses indicated that aperiodic EEG background activity might provide complementary information to traditional qualitative methods. Importantly, aperiodic activity, and specifically the slope of the 1/f<i><sup></sup></i> decay function of the power spectrum, might constitute a biomarker of the underlying population excitability dynamics. Hence, in the context of epileptic activity, an altered spectral slope is often considered as a signature of pathological excitability. To date, it remained unclear if this straightforward interpretation also applies to states of manifest seizure activity. To address this question, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) during focal seizures from patients diagnosed with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (18 patients, 11 females). The results demonstrate that the spectral slope successfully delineates seizure activity. However, the spectral slope was sensitive to the presence and waveform shape of distinct epileptic components. By combining iEEG recordings with simulations, we demonstrate that epileptic spiking activity and associated slow-wave components differentially impact spectral slope estimates. These results offer a more parsimonious explanation for the biophysical origins of aperiodic activity as compared with the concept of an underlying balance between excitation and inhibition.</p>",

    "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
    "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

    "title": "My First C Extension",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've had decent success with pybind11, nanobind, and PyO3 in the past, and I've never really clicked with Cython for text-processing-heavy work. For my latest project, though, I decided to skip binding frameworks entirely and work directly with Python's C API.</p> <p>For a typical text parsing / templating workload, my reasoning went something like this:</p> <ol> <li>If we care about performance, we want to avoid copying or re-encoding potentially large input strings.</li> <li>If we're processing an opaque syntax tree (or other internal representation) with contextual data in the form of Python objects, we want to avoid data object wrappers or other indirect access to that data.</li> <li>If the result is a potentially large string, we want to avoid copying or re-encoding before handing it back to Python.</li> <li>If we exposing a large syntax tree to Python, we want to avoid indirect access for every node in the tree.</li> </ol> <p>The obvious downside is that we have to deal with manual memory management and Python reference counting. That is what I've been practicing with <a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/nano-template\">Nano Template</a>.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/nano-template\">Nano Template</a> is a fast, non-evaluating template engine with syntax that should look familiar if you've used Jinja, Minijinja, or Django templates.</p> <p>Unlike those engines, Nano Template deliberately has a reduced feature set. The idea is to keep application logic out of template text. Instead of manipulating data inside the template, you're expected to prepare it in Python before rendering.</p> <p>Example usage:</p> <pre><code>import nano_template as nt template = nt.parse(&quot;&quot;&quot;\\ {% if page['heading override'] -%} # {{ page['heading override'] }} {% else -%} # Welcome to {{ page.title }}! {% endif %} Hello, {{ you or 'guest' }}. {% for tag in page.tags ~%} - {{ tag.name }} {% endfor -%} &quot;&quot;&quot;) data = { &quot;page&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Demo page&quot;, &quot;tags&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;programming&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 42}, {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;python&quot;}], } } result = template.render(data) print(result) </code></pre> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Nano Template is for Python developers who want improved performance from a template engine at the expense of features.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>A provisional benchmark shows Nano Template to be about 17 times faster than a pure Python implementation, and about 4 times faster than Minijinja, when measuring parsing and rendering together.</p> <p>For scenarios where you're parsing once and rendering many times, Jinja2 tends to beat Minijinja. Nano Template is still about 2.8 time faster than Jinja2 and bout 7.5 time faster than Minijinja in that scenario.</p> <p>Excluding parsing time and limiting our benchmark fixture to simple variable substitution, Nano Template renders about 10% slower than <code>str.format()</code> (we're using cPython's limited C API, which comes with a performance cost).</p> <pre><code>$ python scripts/benchmark.py (001) 5 rounds with 10000 iterations per round. parse c ext : best = 0.092587s | avg = 0.092743s parse pure py : best = 2.378554s | avg = 2.385293s just render c ext : best = 0.061812s | avg = 0.061850s just render pure py : best = 0.314468s | avg = 0.315076s just render jinja2 : best = 0.170373s | avg = 0.170706s just render minijinja : best = 0.454723s | avg = 0.457256s parse and render ext : best = 0.155797s | avg = 0.156455s parse and render pure py : best = 2.733121s | avg = 2.745028s parse and render jinja2 : &lt;with caching disabled, I got bored waiting&gt; parse and render minijinja : best = 0.705995s | avg = 0.707589s $ python scripts/benchmark_format.py (002) 5 rounds with 1000000 iterations per round. render template : best = 0.413830s | avg = 0.419547s format string : best = 0.375050s | avg = 0.375237s </code></pre> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>Jinja or Minijinja are still usually the right choice for a general-purpose template engine. They are well established and plenty fast enough for most use cases (especially if you're parsing once and rendering many times with Jinja).</p> <p>For me, this was mainly a stepping-stone project to get more comfortable with C, the Python C API, and the tooling needed to write and publish safe C extensions. My next project is to rewrite <a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/python-pest\">Python Pest</a> as a C extension using similar techniques.</p> <p>As always, feedback is most welcome.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/nano-template\">https://github.com/jg-rp/nano-template</a><br /> PyPi: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/nano-template/\">https://pypi.org/project/nano-template/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hefty-Pianist-1958\"> /u/Hefty-Pianist-1958 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pn51h1/my_first_c_extension/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pn51h1/my_first_c_extension/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

    "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
    "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

We will release v4.0.0 at the beginning of next year - in just a couple of weeks time. For now, v4.0.0-rc.8 has been released to all channels.</p> <h2>What is Kreuzberg?</h2> <p>Kreuzberg is a document intelligence toolkit for extracting text, metadata, tables, images, and structured data from 56+ file formats. It was originally written in Python (v1-v3), where it demonstrated strong performance characteristics compared to alternatives in the ecosystem.</p> <h2>What's new in V4?</h2> <h3>A Complete Rust Rewrite with Polyglot Bindings</h3> <p>The new version of Kreuzberg represents a massive architectural evolution. <strong>Kreuzberg has been completely rewritten in Rust</strong> - leveraging Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and native performance. The new architecture consists of a high-performance Rust core with native bindings to multiple languages.

Performance and Architecture</h3> <p>The Rust rewrite wasn't just about performance - though that's a major benefit. It was an opportunity to fundamentally rethink the architecture:</p> <p><strong>Architectural improvements:</strong> - <strong>Zero-copy operations</strong> via Rust's ownership model - <strong>True async concurrency</strong> with Tokio runtime (no GIL limitations) - <strong>Streaming parsers</strong> for constant memory usage on multi-GB files - <strong>SIMD-accelerated text processing</strong> for token reduction and string operations - <strong>Memory-safe FFI boundaries</strong> for all language bindings - <strong>Plugin system</strong> with trait-based extensibility</p> <h3>v3 vs v4: What Changed?</h3> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Aspect</th> <th>v3 (Python)</th> <th>v4 (Rust Core)</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Core Language</strong></td> <td>Pure Python</td> <td>Rust 2024 edition</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>File Formats</strong></td> <td>30-40+ (via Pandoc)</td> <td><strong>56+ (native parsers)</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Language Support</strong></td> <td>Python only</td> <td><strong>7 languages</strong> (Rust/Python/TS/Ruby/Java/Go/C#)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dependencies</strong></td> <td>Requires Pandoc (system binary)</td> <td><strong>Zero system dependencies</strong> (all native)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Embeddings</strong></td> <td>Not supported</td> <td>\u2713 FastEmbed with ONNX (3 presets + custom)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Semantic Chunking</strong></td> <td>Via semantic-text-splitter library</td> <td>\u2713 Built-in (text + markdown-aware)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Token Reduction</strong></td> <td>Built-in (TF-IDF based)</td> <td>\u2713 Enhanced with 3 modes</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Language Detection</strong></td> <td>Optional (fast-langdetect)</td> <td>\u2713 Built-in (68 languages)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Keyword Extraction</strong></td> <td>Optional (KeyBERT)</td> <td>\u2713 Built-in (YAKE + RAKE algorithms)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>OCR Backends</strong></td> <td>Tesseract/EasyOCR/PaddleOCR</td> <td><strong>Same + better integration</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Plugin System</strong></td> <td>Limited extractor registry</td> <td><strong>Full trait-based</strong> (4 plugin types)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Page Tracking</strong></td> <td>Character-based indices</td> <td><strong>Byte-based with O(1) lookup</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Servers</strong></td> <td>REST API (Litestar)</td> <td><strong>HTTP (Axum) + MCP + MCP-SSE</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Installation Size</strong></td> <td>~100MB base</td> <td><strong>16-31 MB complete</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Memory Model</strong></td> <td>Python heap management</td> <td><strong>RAII with streaming</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Concurrency</strong></td> <td>asyncio (GIL-limited)</td> <td><strong>Tokio work-stealing</strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h3>Replacement of Pandoc - Native Performance</h3> <p>Kreuzberg v3 relied on <strong>Pandoc</strong> - an amazing tool, but one that had to be invoked via subprocess because of its GPL license. This had significant impacts:</p> <p><strong>v3 Pandoc limitations:</strong> - System dependency (installation required) - Subprocess overhead on every document - No streaming support - Limited metadata extraction - ~500MB+ installation footprint</p> <p><strong>v4 native parsers:</strong> - <strong>Zero external dependencies</strong> - everything is native Rust - Direct parsing with full control over extraction - <strong>Substantially more metadata</strong> extracted (e.g., DOCX document properties, section structure, style information) - <strong>Streaming support</strong> for massive files (tested on multi-GB XML documents with stable memory) - Example: PPTX extractor is now a <strong>fully streaming parser</strong> capable of handling gigabyte-scale presentations with constant memory usage and high throughput</p> <h3>New File Format Support</h3> <p>v4 expanded format support from ~20 to <strong>56+ file formats</strong>, including:</p> <p><strong>Added legacy format support:</strong> - <code>.doc</code> (Word 97-2003) - <code>.ppt</code> (PowerPoint 97-2003) - <code>.xls</code> (Excel 97-2003) - <code>.eml</code> (Email messages) - <code>.msg</code> (Outlook messages)</p> <p><strong>Added academic/technical formats:</strong> - LaTeX (<code>.tex</code>) - BibTeX (<code>.bib</code>) - Typst (<code>.typ</code>) - JATS XML (scientific articles) - DocBook XML - FictionBook (<code>.fb2</code>) - OPML (<code>.opml</code>)</p> <p><strong>Better Office support:</strong> - XLSB, XLSM (Excel binary/macro formats) - Better structured metadata extraction from DOCX/PPTX/XLSX - Full table extraction from presentations - Image extraction with deduplication</p> <h3>New Features: Full Document Intelligence Solution</h3> <p>The v4 rewrite was also an opportunity to close gaps with commercial alternatives and add features specifically designed for <strong>RAG applications and LLM workflows</strong>:</p> <h4>1. <strong>Embeddings (NEW)</strong></h4> <ul> <li><strong>FastEmbed integration</strong> with full ONNX Runtime acceleration</li> <li>Three presets: <code>&quot;fast&quot;</code> (384d), <code>&quot;balanced&quot;</code> (512d), <code>&quot;quality&quot;</code> (768d/1024d)</li> <li>Custom model support (bring your own ONNX model)</li> <li>Local generation (no API calls, no rate limits)</li> <li>Automatic model downloading and caching</li> <li>Per-chunk embedding generation</li> </ul> <p>```python from kreuzberg import ExtractionConfig, EmbeddingConfig, EmbeddingModelType</p> <p>config = ExtractionConfig( embeddings=EmbeddingConfig( model=EmbeddingModelType.preset(&quot;balanced&quot;), normalize=True ) ) result = kreuzberg.extract_bytes(pdf_bytes, config=config)</p> <h1>result.embeddings contains vectors for each chunk</h1> <p>```</p> <h4>2. <strong>Semantic Text Chunking (NOW BUILT-IN)</strong></h4> <p>Now integrated directly into the core (v3 used external semantic-text-splitter library): - <strong>Structure-aware chunking</strong> that respects document semantics - Two strategies: - Generic text chunker (whitespace/punctuation-aware) - Markdown chunker (preserves headings, lists, code blocks, tables) - Configurable chunk size and overlap - Unicode-safe (handles CJK, emojis correctly) - Automatic chunk-to-page mapping - Per-chunk metadata with byte offsets</p> <h4>3. <strong>Byte-Accurate Page Tracking (BREAKING CHANGE)</strong></h4> <p>This is a critical improvement for LLM applications:</p> <ul> <li><strong>v3</strong>: Character-based indices (<code>char_start</code>/<code>char_end</code>) - incorrect for UTF-8 multi-byte characters</li> <li><strong>v4</strong>: Byte-based indices (<code>byte_start</code>/<code>byte_end</code>) - correct for all string operations</li> </ul> <p>Additional page features: - O(1) lookup: &quot;which page is byte offset X on?&quot; \u2192 instant answer - Per-page content extraction - Page markers in combined text (e.g., <code>--- Page 5 ---</code>) - Automatic chunk-to-page mapping for citations</p> <h4>4. <strong>Enhanced Token Reduction for LLM Context</strong></h4> <p>Enhanced from v3 with three configurable modes to save on LLM costs:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Light mode</strong>: ~15% reduction (preserve most detail)</li> <li><strong>Moderate mode</strong>: ~30% reduction (balanced)</li> <li><strong>Aggressive mode</strong>: ~50% reduction (key information only)</li> </ul> <p>Uses TF-IDF sentence scoring with position-aware weighting and language-specific stopword filtering.

    "title": "\u03b42-Protocadherins organize parallel indirect basal ganglia circuits",
    "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) contain multiple parallel neural circuits, each of which may control different behaviors. However, how the distinct parallel BG circuits are molecularly organized is not known. Here we show that two {delta}2-protocadherins (PCDHs), PCDH17 and PCDH10, which are homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, establish and define two distinct indirect BG circuits that regulate different behaviors. PCDH17 and PCDH10 are expressed in a complementary expression pattern in the BG, anatomically defining two parallel indirect BG connections. Indirect pathway-specific Pcdh17 and Pcdh10 conditional knockout (cKO) mice show impaired establishment of the indirect BG circuits in a region-preferential manner. Finally, the Pcdh17-cKO mice show defects in task learning, while the Pcdh10-cKO mice show defects in motor/sensory habituation. These results identify PCDH17 and PCDH10 as the molecular organizers for two distinct indirect BG circuits regulating different behaviors and reveal the molecular mechanisms for organizing parallel BG circuits.",

    "title": "Differential Regulation of APOE4-Mediated Astrocytic Lipid Metabolism by BMP Signaling Exacerbates Alzheimers Disease Pathologies in Neurons",
    "content": "The two greatest risk factors for Alzheimers Disease (AD) are aging and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) polymorphism, yet how these factors interact remain unclear. In this study, we investigate how bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which increases with age, contributes to APOE4-induced lipid metabolic dysfunctions using induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and cocultured neurons. Surprisingly, BMP signaling differentially altered lipid droplet formation, cholesterol synthesis and breakdown, and fatty acid-oxidation in APOE4 compared to APOE3 astrocytes, and increased secretion of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). Furthermore, neurons cocultured with BMP4-treated APOE4 astrocytes showed altered transcriptomic profiles based on scRNA-seq as well as increased tau phosphorylation (p-tau). oxLDL treatment similarly increased p-tau and reduced neuronal survival. Conversely, lipid uptake inhibition in neurons rescued the BMP4/APOE4 astrocyte-induced neuronal phenotype. These data demonstrate key interactions between APOE4 and aging-associated molecular signaling in AD pathogenesis and establish a causal linkage between astrocytic lipid metabolism and neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation.",

    "content": "Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, are known for sculpting excitatory neural circuits via dynamic processes. However, their role in modulating inhibitory synaptic connections in adulthood remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified an underappreciated microglia subpopulation, satellite microglia with physical soma-soma contact with neurons, that reshape inhibitory circuit connectivity and gate neuronal activity by shielding inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse brain. Using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in adult mice, we observed in real time that satellite microglia associations displaced perisomatic inhibitory synapses whereas their dissociation permitted inhibitory synaptogenesis. Redistribution of satellite microglia reorganized inhibitory connectivity, altered local neural networks and changed behaviors. These findings establish satellite microglia as key architects of inhibitory circuitry and suggest their broader role in neural plasticity in health and disease.",

    "title": "A bifunctional optical reporter for tracking estrogen response dynamics in neurons",
    "content": "Estrogens are inherently dynamic signaling molecules whose fluctuations induce profound shifts in physiology and behavior. However, methods for tracking the dynamics of estrogen action in vivo are limited and not tissue-specific, making it difficult to directly relate dynamics to ongoing physiological, behavioral, and neural changes. Traditionally, estrogen sensitive cells have been identified by metrics such as receptor expression or radioactive ligand binding, but these measures do not capture the dynamic nature of hormone response. In addition, current methods for assessing the dynamics of estrogens in an individual, including microdialysis and vaginal cytology, lack temporal and spatial resolution.To address this need we developed a bifunctional reporter called neuro-seeER (neuronal see Estrogen Response) that can be used to track changes in exogenous and endogenous estrogen dynamics in vitro and in vivo, including longitudinally in behaving animals. We confirmed that the fluorescent response requires estrogen receptor expression, is specific to activation with estradiol, and is consistent with the timescale of transcriptional induction. Neuro-seeER expression in the hypothalamus of Esr1-Cre mice revealed dynamic labeling of estrogen-responsive cells following treatment with exogenous estradiol, and fluorescence-aided cell sorting followed by RNA-sequencing confirmed that high neuro-seeER response is associated with enriched expression of genes associated with endogenous estrogen responses. Using a novel \"snapshot\" photometry method to track the dynamics longitudinally in vivo, we demonstrate that we can robustly detect exogenous estrogen response across multiple hypothalamic sites simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that this tool is uniquely suited to capturing endogenous estrogen response dynamics in vivo across the long timescale of the estrous cycle, revealing individual differences in neural estrogen dynamics. Together, these findings reveal unexpected cellular and temporal heterogeneity of the transcriptional response and demonstrate the feasibility of tracking the dynamics of hormonal response alongside additional neural, cell signaling, or behavioral measures.",

    "title": "Functional brain network analysis in patients with upper-limb spasticity after stroke",
    "content": "IntroductionStroke ranks as the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with the resulting upper-limb spasticity severely impairing patients\u2019 motor function and quality of life. However, existing clinical assessment scales exhibit a degree of subjectivity, and research into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying spasticity remains insufficient. Brain network analysis offers a novel perspective for investigating the neural mechanisms associated with spasticity.MethodsEight patients with upper limb spasticity due to stroke (MAS grades 1\u20132) and eight healthy controls were enrolled. Multi-channel EEG signals were recorded during different upper limb movements (fist clenching, elbow flexion, wrist flexion). Functional brain networks were constructed using the weighted phase delay index, and further calculations were performed on relevant brain network characteristics, including node degree, global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, and small-world properties.ResultsResearch findings indicate that functional connectivity in spasticity patients is significantly lower than in healthy subjects, particularly in the alpha and beta frequency bands, with weaker cross-regional synchrony in frontal, central, and temporal lobe regions. Graph theory analysis further reveals that compared to healthy controls, spasticity patients exhibit significantly reduced global efficiency, local efficiency, and clustering coefficient, while small-world properties remain relatively preserved. Node degree analysis revealed abnormal compensatory activation in temporal and parietal regions, whereas healthy participants exhibited higher node degrees in central and frontal areas. These findings suggest that spasticity is associated with impaired local and global network integration, accompanied by inefficient compensatory mechanisms.DiscussionThis study provides new evidence that post-stroke upper limb spasticity is not only a peripheral muscle phenomenon but also reflects disturbances in cortical network dynamics. Brain network metrics, particularly global and local efficiency, may serve as objective biomarkers to quantify spasticity severity and guide personalized rehabilitation interventions, offering a promising direction for developing precision rehabilitation strategies.",

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "title": "Association between hippocampal subfield volumes and working memory in middle-aged and older adult cancer patients",
    "content": "BackgroundCancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is relatively common among middle-aged and older adult cancer patients, with working memory deficits being particularly prominent. However, the underlying structural basis of hippocampal subregions remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate differences in hippocampal subfield volumes and working memory function between cancer patients and healthy controls, as well as to analyze the correlation between hippocampal structural alterations and working memory impairment.MethodsThe cohort comprised 51 cancer patients and 45 healthy controls. All participants underwent 3D-T1 structural MRI scans and cognitive assessments. Hippocampal subfields were automatically segmented using FreeSurfer 7.4, and their volumes were calculated. Group differences in cognitive test scores were compared. After controlling for total intracranial volume (TIV), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to examine differences in hippocampal subfield volumes between groups. Spearman correlation analysis was undertaken to assess the relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and cognitive test scores in patients with cancer.ResultsCompared with healthy controls, cancer patients exhibited significantly lower scores in the digit span test (DST) total score (U\u2009=\u2009716.50, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and digit span forward (DSF) subtest (U\u2009=\u2009738.50, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Hippocampal subfield analysis revealed significant volume reductions in the cancer group, particularly in CA3 (F\u2009=\u20098.141, p\u2009=\u20090.005) and CA4 (F\u2009=\u20096.770, p\u2009=\u20090.011). Correlation analysis demonstrated that the volumes of the hippocampal head (r\u2009=\u20090.410, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and hippocampal molecular layer (r\u2009=\u20090.389, p\u2009=\u20090.005) were positively associated with DST scores in cancer patients.ConclusionCancer patients exhibit working memory impairment and hippocampal subfield atrophy. The significant correlation between the volumes of the hippocampal head and molecular layer with working memory performance suggests that these regions may play a critical role in cancer-related cognitive dysfunction.",

    "title": "ER stress sensors at the ER-mitochondrial interface, controlling mitochondrial health in neurodegenerative diseases",
    "content": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria are essential organelles that interact closely at specialized sites known as ER-mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). MAM is enriched with proteins from both the ER and mitochondria. ER stress sensors\u2014inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) \u2014 are traditionally recognized for their roles in the unfolded protein response (UPR), which mitigates proteotoxic stress. However, recent studies reveal their non-canonical functions at MAMs, where they regulate calcium signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, and apoptosis through interactions with MAM-resident proteins. Disruption of these pathways is implicated in various diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. This review highlights the emerging roles of IRE1 and PERK in preserving mitochondrial function and their relevance to neurodegeneration. It also examines pharmacological strategies targeting these proteins, which influence both UPR signaling and ER-mitochondrial communication, offering a comprehensive perspective on their roles in health and disease.",

    "title": "Toward accurate Alzheimer\u2019s detection: transfer learning with ResNet50 for MRI-based diagnosis",
    "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, affects more than 50 million individuals worldwide and demands accurate and timely diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. Traditional machine-learning approaches for AD detection using MRI often rely on manual feature extraction, which is labor-intensive and limits scalability. There is a growing need for automated, high-accuracy methods that can support clinical workflows and respond to the expected tripling of AD cases by 2050.MethodsThis study proposes an automated feature-extraction approach using a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to brain MRI scans. Extracted deep features were classified using three different algorithms: Softmax, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Performance was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: ADNI and MIRIAD.ResultsAmong the tested models, the ResNet50-Softmax combination demonstrated the highest performance, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks (85.7%\u201398.59%). It achieved 99% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and an overall 99% accuracy on the ADNI dataset. On the MIRIAD dataset, the model also performed strongly, reaching 96% accuracy.DiscussionThe results confirm that transfer learning using ResNet50 significantly enhances the accuracy and scalability of AD diagnosis from MRI data. By eliminating the need for manual feature extraction and offering near-perfect classification performance, this approach can streamline clinical neuroimaging workflows. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning models to support early diagnosis and meet the increasing global burden of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

    "title": "Established and emerging new approach methodologies in neuroscience",
    "content": "The increasing need for ethical, human-relevant, and efficient alternatives to animal testing is driving the development of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) in safety assessment and drug development. However, the inherent complexity of neurological diseases presents a significant challenge to fully replace animal models in this field. In neuroscience, a range of NAMs, from traditional 2D cell cultures to advanced brain organoids and alternative vertebrate models like zebrafish, demonstrate complementary strengths and limitations. Together, these models support translational research, including the investigation of neurodevelopment, disease, and neurotoxicity. While human and mouse brain organoids that mimic the structural and functional properties of mammalian brain tissue hold great promise, their applicability for high-throughput screening is hindered by their cost- and time-intensive nature. Complementary approaches such as embryonic and larval zebrafish models and the emerging zebrafish brain organoids provide faster, cost-effective, and scalable yet biologically relevant platforms for early-phase screening, thanks to the zebrafish\u2019s rapid development, conserved vertebrate neuroanatomy, and proven value in toxicology. This review maps the current landscape of NAMs in neuroscience, examining approaches ranging from 2D and 3D in vitro systems to zebrafish models. It highlights the advantages and challenges of the different models, including a comparison of human, mouse, and zebrafish brain organoids, and outlines the future directions for integrating these complementary systems into robust, efficient, and ethically responsible pipelines for both early-phase toxicity testing and drug discovery.",

    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.11564v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Text entry in Virtual Reality (VR) is challenging, even when accounting for the use of controllers. Prior work has tackled this challenge head-on, improving the efficiency of input methods. These techniques have the advantage of allowing for relatively straightforward text correction. However, text correction without the use of controllers is a topic that has not received the same amount of attention, even though it can be desirable in several scenarios, and can even be the source of frustration. Large language models have been adopted and evaluated as a corrective methodology, given their high power for predictions. Nevertheless, their predictions are not always correct, which can lead to lower usability. In this paper, we investigate whether, for text correction in VR that is hands-free, the use of AI could surpass in terms of usability and efficiency. We observed better usability for AI text correction when compared to voice input.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.11472v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective communication of robotic touch intent is a key factor in promoting safe and predictable physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). While intent communication has been widely studied, existing approaches lack the spatial specificity and semantic depth necessary to convey robot touch actions. We present Mirror Skin, a cephalopod-inspired concept that utilizes high-resolution, mirror-like visual feedback on robotic skin. By mapping in-situ visual representations of a human's body parts onto the corresponding robot's touch region, Mirror Skin communicates who shall initiate touch, where it will occur, and when it is imminent. To inform the design of Mirror Skin, we conducted a structured design exploration with experts in virtual reality (VR), iteratively refining six key dimensions. A subsequent controlled user study demonstrated that Mirror Skin significantly enhances accuracy and reduces response times for interpreting touch intent. These findings highlight the potential of visual feedback on robotic skin to communicate human-robot touch interactions.",

    "title": "AI Autonomy or Human Dependency? Defining the Boundary in Responsible AI with the ${\\alpha}$-Coefficient",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.11295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The integrity of contemporary AI systems is undermined by a critical design flaw: the misappropriation of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) models to mask systems that are fundamentally reliant on human labor. We term this structural reliance Human-Instead-of-AI (HISOAI). HISOAI systems represent an ethical failure and an unsustainable economic dependency, where human workers function as hidden operational fallbacks rather than strategic collaborators. To rectify this, we propose the AI-First, Human-Empowered (AFHE) paradigm. AFHE mandates a technological design where the AI component must achieve a minimum, quantifiable level of functional independence prior to deployment. This standard is formalized through the AI Autonomy Coefficient (alpha), a metric that determines the proportion of tasks that the AI successfully processes without mandatory human substitution. We introduce the AFHE Deployment Algorithm, an algorithmic gate that requires the system to meet a specified alpha threshold across both offline and shadow testing. By enforcing this structural separation, the AFHE framework redefines the human's role to focus exclusively on high-value tasks, including ethical oversight, boundary pushing, and strategic model tuning, thereby ensuring true system transparency and operational independence. This work advocates for a critical shift toward metric-driven, structurally sound AI architecture, moving the industry beyond deceptive human dependency toward verifiable autonomy.",

As populations age and caregiver networks shrink, the need for reliable support in Advance Care Planning (ACP) grows. To probe this fraught design space of using proxy agents for high-risk, high-subjectivity decisions, we built an experience prototype (\\acpagent{}) and asked 15 participants in 4 workshops to train it to be their personal proxy in ACP decisions. We analysed their coping strategies and feature requests and mapped the results onto axes of agent autonomy and human control. Our findings argue for a potential new role of AI in ACP where agents act as personal advocates for individuals, building mutual intelligibility over time.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.11245v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Postoperative upper limb dysfunction is prevalent among breast cancer survivors, yet their adherence to at-home rehabilitation exercises is low amidst limited nursing resources. The hardware overhead of commonly adopted VR-based mHealth solutions further hinders their widespread clinical application. Therefore, we developed Breast-Rehab, a novel, low-cost mHealth system to provide patients with out-of-hospital upper limb rehabilitation management. Breast-Rehab integrates a bespoke human action recognition algorithm with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. By fusing visual and 3D skeletal data, our model accurately segments exercise videos recorded in uncontrolled home environments, outperforming standard models. These segmented clips, combined with a domain-specific knowledge base, guide a multi-modal large language model to generate clinically relevant assessment reports. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead and mitigates model hallucinations. We implemented the system as a WeChat Mini Program and a nurse-facing dashboard. A preliminary clinical study validated the system's feasibility and user acceptance, with patients achieving an average exercise frequency of 0.59 sessions/day over a two-week period. This work thus presents a complete, validated pipeline for AI-driven, at-home rehabilitation monitoring.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.11105v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While drug discovery is vital for human health, the process remains inefficient. Medicinal chemists must navigate a vast protein space to identify target proteins that meet three criteria: physical and functional interactions, therapeutic impact, and docking potential. Prior approaches have provided fragmented support for each criterion, limiting the generation of promising hypotheses for wet-lab experiments. We present HAPPIER, an AI-powered tool that supports hypothesis generation with integrated multi-criteria support for target identification. HAPPIER enables medicinal chemists to 1) efficiently explore and verify proteins in a single integrated graph component showing multi-criteria satisfaction and 2) validate AI suggestions with domain knowledge. These capabilities facilitate iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, essential for hypothesis generation. We evaluated HAPPIER with ten medicinal chemists, finding that it increased the number of high-confidence hypotheses and support for the iterative cycle, and further demonstrated the relationship between engaging in such cycles and confidence in outputs.",

This study investigates how people use ChatGPT for such planning tasks, focusing on user practices, uncertainties, and perceptions of AI assistance. We conducted an interview study with 14 participants who engaged in long-term planning activities using ChatGPT, combining analysis of their prompts and interview responses. The task topics across diverse domains, including personal well-being, event planning, and professional learning, along with prompts to initiate, refine, and contextualize plans. ChatGPT helped structure complex goals into manageable steps, generate ideas, and sustain motivation, serving as a reflective partner. Yet its outputs were often generic or idealized, lacking personalization, contextual realism, and adaptability, requiring users to actively adapt and verify results. Participants expressed a need for AI systems that provide adaptive and trustworthy guidance while acknowledging uncertainty and potential failure in long-term planning.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.11065v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Affective artificial intelligence has made substantial advances in recent years; yet two critical issues persist, particularly in sensitive applications. First, these systems frequently operate as 'black boxes', leaving their decision-making processes opaque. Second, audit logs often lack reliability, as the entity operating the system may alter them. In this work, we introduce the concept of Immutable Explainability, an architecture designed to address both challenges simultaneously. Our approach combines an interpretable inference engine - implemented through fuzzy logic to produce a transparent trace of each decision - with a cryptographic anchoring mechanism that records this trace on a blockchain, ensuring that it is tamper-evident and independently verifiable. To validate the approach, we implemented a heuristic pipeline integrating lexical and prosodic analysis within an explicit Mamdani-type multimodal fusion engine. Each inference generates an auditable record that is subsequently anchored on a public blockchain (Sepolia Testnet). We evaluated the system using the Spanish MEACorpus 2023, employing both the original corpus transcriptions and those generated by Whisper. The results show that our fuzzy-fusion approach outperforms baseline methods (linear and unimodal fusion). Beyond these quantitative outcomes, our primary objective is to establish a foundation for affective AI systems that offer transparent explanations, trustworthy audit trails, and greater user control over personal data.",

While some frame AI as a replacement for human intelligence, and others warn of cognitive decline, this position paper argues for a third perspective grounded in practical observation: AI as a cognitive amplifier that magnifies existing human capabilities rather than substituting for them. Drawing on research in human-computer interaction, cognitive augmentation theory, and educational technology, alongside field observations from corporate training across writing, software development, and data analysis domains, I present a framework positioning AI tools as intelligence amplification systems where output quality depends fundamentally on user expertise and judgment. Through analysis of empirical studies on expert-novice differences and systematic observations from professional training contexts, I demonstrate that domain knowledge, quality judgment, and iterative refinement capabilities create substantial performance gaps between users. I propose a three-level model of AI engagement -- from passive acceptance through iterative collaboration to cognitive direction -- and argue that the transition between levels requires not technical training but development of domain expertise and metacognitive skills. This position has critical implications for workforce development and AI system design. Rather than focusing solely on AI literacy or technical prompt engineering, I advocate for integrated approaches that strengthen domain expertise, evaluative judgment, and reflective practice.",

However, it remains challenging to effectively integrate multimodal MRI while achieving neuroscience interpretability. Here we propose to use Laplacian harmonics and spectral graph theory for multimodal alignment and multiscale integration. Based on the cortical mesh and connectome matrix that offer multi-scale representations, we devise Laplacian operators and spectral graph attentions to construct a shared latent space for model alignment. Next, we employ a disentangled learning combined with Graph Variational Autoencoder architectures to separate scale-specific and shared features. Lastly, we design a mutual information-informed bilevel regularizer to separate causal and non-causal factors based on the disentangled features, achieving robust model performance with enhanced interpretability. Our model outperforms baselines and other state-of-the-art models. The ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.11000v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Representations pervade our daily experience, from letters representing sounds to bit strings encoding digital files. While such representations require externally defined decoders to convey meaning, conscious experience appears fundamentally different: a neural state corresponding to perceiving a red square cannot alternatively encode the experience of a green square. This intrinsic property of consciousness suggests that conscious representations must be unambiguous in a way that conventional representations are not. We formalize this intuition using information theory, defining representational ambiguity as the conditional entropy H(I|R) over possible interpretations I given a representation R. Through experiments on neural networks trained to classify MNIST digits, we demonstrate that relational structures in network connectivity can unambiguously encode representational content. Using both learned decoders and direct geometric matching, we achieve perfect (100%) accuracy for dropout-trained networks and 38% for standard backpropagation in identifying output neuron class identity, despite identical task performance, demonstrating that representational ambiguity can arise orthogonally to behavioral accuracy. We further show that spatial position information of input neurons can be decoded from network connectivity with R2 up to 0.844. These results provide a quantitative method for measuring representational ambiguity in neural systems and demonstrate that neural networks can exhibit the low-ambiguity representations posited as necessary (though not sufficient) by theoretical accounts of consciousness.",

The concept of cognitome, introduced by the academician K.V. Anokhin, as the cognitive structure of the mind -- a high-order structure of the brain and a neural hypernetwork, is considered as the basis for modeling. Consciousness then is a special form of dynamics in this hypernetwork -- a large-scale integration of its cognitive elements. The cognitome, in turn, consists of interconnected COGs (cognitive groups of neurons) of two types -- functional systems and cellular ensembles. K.V. Anokhin sees the task of the fundamental theory of the brain and mind in describing these structures, their origin, functions and processes in them. The paper presents mathematical models of these structures based on new mathematical results, as well as models of different cognitive processes in terms of these models. In addition, it is shown that these models can be derived based on a fairly general principle of the brain works: \\textit{the brain discovers all possible causal relationships in the external world and draws all possible conclusions from them}. Based on these results, the paper presents models of: ``natural\" classification; theory of functional brain systems by P.K. Anokhin; prototypical theory of categorization by E.

We propose a biologically inspired mathematical model that uses this idea to identify and separate the self from the environment and then build and use a self-model for better predictions. This is a model of neocortical columns governed by the basal ganglia to make predictions and choose the next action, where some columns act as 'what' columns and others act as 'where' columns. Based on this model, we present a reinforcement learning agent that learns purposeful behavior in a virtual environment. We evaluate the agent on the Atari games Pong and Breakout, where it successfully learns to play. We conclude that the ability to separate the self from the environment gives advantages to the agent and therefore such a model could appear in living organisms during evolution. We propose Self-Awareness Principle 1: the ability to separate the self from the world is a necessary but insufficient condition for self-awareness.",

Neural mass models (NMMs) (aggregate neural models) provide one of the most popular gateways into this landscape, but their sheer variety -- spanning lumped parameter models, firing-rate equations, and multi-layer generators -- demands a unifying framework that situates diverse architectures along a continuum of abstraction and biological detail. Here, we start from the idea that oscillations originate from a simple push-pull interaction between two or more neural populations. We build from the undamped harmonic oscillator and, guided by a simple push-pull motif between excitatory and inhibitory populations, climb a systematic ladder of detail. Each rung is presented first in isolation, next under forcing, and then within a coupled network, reflecting the progression from single-node to whole-brain modeling. By transforming a repertoire of disparate formalisms into a navigable ladder, we hope to turn NMM choice from a subjective act into a principled design decision, helping both theorists and experimentalists translate between scales, modalities, and interventions. In doing so, we offer a \\emph{Rosetta Stone} for brain oscillation models -- one that lets the field speak a common dynamical language while preserving the dialectical richness that fuels discovery.",

This review synthesizes the evolving understanding of AD pathogenesis, moving beyond the linear amyloid cascade hypothesis to conceptualize the disease as a cross-talk of intricately interacting pathologies, encompassing Abeta, tau, and neuroinflammation. This evolving pathophysiological understanding parallels a transformation in diagnostic paradigms, where biomarker-based strategies -- such as the AT(N) framework -- enable early disease detection during preclinical or prodromal stages. Within this new landscape, while anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies (e.g., lecanemab, donanemab) represent a breakthrough as the first disease-modifying therapies, their modest efficacy underscores the limitation of single-target approaches. Therefore, this review explores the compelling rationale for combination therapies that simultaneously target Abeta pathology, aberrant tau, and neuroinflammation. Looking forward, we emphasize emerging technological platforms -- such as gene editing and biophysical neuromodulation -- n advancing precision medicine. Ultimately, the integration of early biomarker detection, multi-target therapeutic strategies, and AI-driven patient stratification charts a promising roadmap toward fundamentally altering the trajectory of AD. The future of AD management will be defined by preemptive, biomarker-guided, and personalized combination interventions.",

    "title": "Cognitive Mirrors: Exploring the Diverse Functional Roles of Attention Heads in LLM Reasoning",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.10978v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, but remain largely opaque in terms of their internal mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to improve their reasoning abilities. Drawing inspiration from the interplay between neural processes and human cognition, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the roles and behaviors of attention heads, which are key components of LLMs. We introduce CogQA, a dataset that decomposes complex questions into step-by-step subquestions with a chain-of-thought design, each associated with specific cognitive functions such as retrieval or logical reasoning. By applying a multi-class probing method, we identify the attention heads responsible for these functions. Our analysis across multiple LLM families reveals that attention heads exhibit functional specialization, characterized as cognitive heads. These cognitive heads exhibit several key properties: they are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across different cognitive functions, and display interactive and hierarchical structures. We further show that cognitive heads play a vital role in reasoning tasks - removing them leads to performance degradation, while augmenting them enhances reasoning accuracy. These insights offer a deeper understanding of LLM reasoning and suggest important implications for model design, training, and fine-tuning strategies.",

    "title": "The Homological Brain: Parity Principle and Amortized Inference",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.10976v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Biological intelligence emerges from substrates that are slow, noisy, and energetically constrained, yet it performs rapid and coherent inference in open-ended environments. Classical computational theories, built around vector-space transformations and instantaneous error minimization, struggle to reconcile the slow timescale of synaptic plasticity with the fast timescale of perceptual synthesis. We propose a unifying framework based on algebraic topology, the Homological Brain, in which neural computation is understood as the construction and navigation of topological structure. Central to this view is the Parity Principle, a homological partition between even-dimensional scaffolds encoding stable content ($\\Phi$) and odd-dimensional flows encoding dynamic context ($\\Psi$). Transient contextual flows are resolved through a three-stage topological trinity transformation: Search (open-chain exploration), Closure (topological cycle formation), and Condensation (collapse of validated flows into new scaffold). This process converts high-complexity recursive search (formally modeled by Savitch's Theorem in NPSPACE) into low-complexity navigation over a learned manifold (analogous to memoized Dynamic Programming in P). In this framework, topological condensation is the mechanism that transforms a ``search problem'' into a ``navigation task'', allowing the brain to amortize past inference and achieve rapid perceptual integration. This perspective unifies the Wake-Sleep cycle, episodic-to-semantic consolidation, and dual-process theories (System 1-vs-System 2), revealing the brain as a homology engine that minimizes topological complexity to transmute high-entropy sensory flux into low-entropy, invariant cognitive structure.",

    "title": "Quantifying the Dynamics of Consciousness using Hierarchical Integration, Organised Complexity and Metastability",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.10972v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Quantifying the neural signatures of consciousness remains a major challenge in neuroscience and AI. Although many theories link consciousness to rich, multiscale, and flexible neural organisation, robust quantitative measures are still lacking. This paper presents a theory-neutral framework that characterises consciousness-related dynamics through three properties: hierarchical integration (H), cross-frequency complexity (D), and metastability (M). Candidate subsystems are identified using predictive information, temporal complexity, and state-space exploration to distinguish structured from unstructured activity. We provide mathematical definitions for all components and implement the framework in a generative model of synthetic EEG, simulating nine brain states ranging from psychedelic and wakeful to dreaming, non-REM sleep, minimally conscious, anaesthetised, and seizure-like regimes. Across single trials and Monte Carlo ensembles, the composite index reliably separates high-consciousness from impaired or non-conscious states. We further validate the framework using real EEG from the Sleep-EDF dataset alongside matched synthetic EEG designed to reproduce state-dependent oscillatory structure. Across Wake, N2, and REM sleep, synthetic data recapitulate the empirical ordering and magnitude of the index, indicating that the index captures stable and biologically meaningful distinctions. This approach provides a principled and empirically grounded tool for quantifying consciousness-related neural organisation with potential applications to both biological and artificial systems.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

    "title": "Automatic binding of basic sensory features requires consciousness",
    "content": "Conscious awareness requires establishing coherent percepts. Yet, whether consciousness is necessary for initiating the integration of basic sensory features remains unclear. Competing theories implicate distinct functional regimes of consciousness in the process of feature binding and creating conscious percepts. We used a novel multi-feature oddball paradigm with intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) recordings in awake and anesthetized states to investigate the functional boundary of consciousness. In the awake state, the auditory attributes of loudness and tone, as well as the binding of the two features, were automatically encoded without attention to the stimuli in a functionally localized sensory cortical network. In the anesthetized state, the cortical registration of single attributes was preserved, whereas the binding was abolished. Moreover, anesthesia mostly influenced later cortical processes after stimuli offset. These results reveal the borderline of exertion of consciousness between the encoding and manipulation of basic sensory features in local cortical circuits: the functional boundary of consciousness constrains the feedforward binding and recurrent process directly at local rather than global level computations.",

    "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
    "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

    "title": "Exploring the n-back task: insights, applications, and future directions",
    "content": "The n-back task has become a central paradigm for investigating the mechanisms of working memory (WM) and related executive functions. This review provides an integrative analysis of the n-back experiment, covering its cognitive operations, task variants, neuroimaging findings, and practical applications across multiple domains. We first delineate three core cognitive components\u2014updating, maintenance, and attentional control\u2014and summarize converging evidence that these functions rely on overlapping fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal networks. We then examine major task variants and review applications in: (1) cognitive training and transfer effects, particularly the proposed association between WM and fluid intelligence; (2) clinical contexts including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and neurological rehabilitation; (3) developmental and educational settings; and (4) emerging research on social cognition, stress, and emotional regulation. Critically, this review evaluates ongoing inconsistencies in how the n-back task is interpreted as a measure of WM and highlights methodological factors, such as task heterogeneity, multi-process interference, and mental fatigue, that complicate both behavioral and neural inferences. To address these issues, we outline methodological recommendations including adaptive task design, multimodal physiological monitoring, and standardized experimental protocols. We further discuss future directions involving virtual reality (VR), mobile platforms, and brain-computer interface (BCI) integration to improve ecological validity and translational relevance. By synthesizing behavioral and neural evidence, this review underscores the n-back task\u2019s versatility while emphasizing the need for improved construct clarity and methodological rigor.",

    "title": "Lexical retrieval in fluent and nonfluent aphasia: a network analysis of verbal fluency data",
    "content": "Lexical retrieval is commonly impaired in many persons with aphasia (PWA). Verbal fluency tasks are often used to assess lexical retrieval ability. However, common methods of analyzing verbal fluency data (e.g., total number of appropriate responses, clustering and switching) fail to adequately capture the underlying organization of the mental lexicon. To better understand the nature of lexical-semantic organization in aphasia, this study applied a semantic network approach to verbal fluency data obtained from 120 healthy controls and 127 PWA (64 fluent and 63 nonfluent). Participants named as many animal category members as they could in 1\u202fmin, and their responses were converted into semantic networks. Global network metrics were computed for each group, including average shortest path length, clustering coefficient, and modularity. Compared to the healthy control network, the PWA network was less integrated and more fragmented, reflected by longer average shortest path lengths, reduced clustering, and higher modularity. These disruptions were especially evident in the nonfluent PWA network compared to the fluent PWA network. Complementary spreading activation and percolation analyses demonstrated that PWA networks were both less efficient and less resilient to disruption. Our results demonstrate that network-based analyses of verbal fluency provide a sensitive measure of lexical-semantic organization in aphasia, revealing structural disruptions that are not fully captured by traditional analyses. More broadly, this approach highlights how network science can advance theories of lexical-semantic organization and inform the development of individualized clinical assessments and treatment strategies.",

    "content": "BackgroundHigh-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that offers increased spatial precision compared to conventional tDCS. As its use has expanded across research and clinical settings, there has been increasing interest in understanding its safety and tolerability.ObjectiveThis review summarizes adverse events related to HD-tDCS in both healthy and clinical populations, focusing on how stimulation intensity, session frequency, and polarity influence tolerability.ResultsIn healthy populations, HD-tDCS is most often administered at 1\u20132\u2009mA for 20\u2009min. The most reported adverse events include tingling, itching and burning localized to the site of stimulation, typically described as mild or transient. Studies comparing active and sham stimulation generally report no significant differences in adverse event frequency or intensity, even at higher intensities of 2\u20133\u2009mA. Reports of severe adverse events are rare, and participant dropout due to discomfort is uncommon. Multi-session protocols show similar safety profiles, suggesting that repeated stimulation does not increase adverse effects. In clinical populations HD-tDCS is typically delivered across multiple sessions. Reported adverse events are mild and transient, with few reports of severe outcomes. Polarity-specific comparisons suggest that anodal and cathodal stimulation are similarly tolerated, with no notable differences in adverse event profiles.ConclusionOverall, current evidence indicates that HD-tDCS is a safe and well-tolerated technique across diverse populations and stimulation parameters. Continued use of standardized adverse event reporting will be important to further confirm these findings as clinical application broaden.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study aims to establish the risk factors and predictive model for the occurrence of delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.MethodsData from 155 patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma at the affiliated hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from January 2018 to May 2023 were analyzed. These patients were randomly divided into a training group (108 cases, 70%) and a validation group (47 cases, 30%). Univariate and Multivariate Logistic regression analysis were conducted on the training group to identify risk factors for delayed hyponatremia after surgery. A predictive model was established using R software and validated.ResultsAfter conducting Univariate and Multivariate Logistic regression analysis, factors influencing the occurrence of delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma were identified as follows: elevated preoperative prolactin levels, higher preoperative suprasellar cistern height, and hyponatremia in the first 1\u20132\u202fdays after surgery. The area under the ROC curve for forecasting delayed postoperative hyponatremia (DPH) in training and validation sets was 0.943 and 0.959, respectively. The DCA curve indicated a higher benefit in clinical application.ConclusionThe risk prediction model for delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma, developed in this study, demonstrates favorable predictive performance. The nomogram can be utilized for early identification of high-risk individuals for DPH.",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Microglia and its P2RY12 Receptors Regulate Seizure Severity",
    "content": "Microglia have emerged as possible regulators of seizures with previous approaches employed being insufficiently selective of microglial-specific contributions. To more definitely determine microglial roles in seizure severity, we used the recently developed genetic microglial-deficient Csf1r{Delta}FIRE/{Delta}FIRE (FIRE KO) mouse model. In this model, mice lack microglia but retain brain border associated macrophages (BAMs). Using two experimental seizure paradigms with either a chemoconvulsant or electrical stimulation, we confirm that a microglial deficiency exacerbates seizures, reduces survival and facilitates the likelihood of developing spontaneous recurrent seizures, indicating that microglia constrain seizure activity across different seizure paradigms. To gain insights into molecular regulators of seizure severity under microglial regulation, we examined P2RY12 contributions and demonstrate that a loss of microglial P2RY12 increased seizure severity in both global and microglial-specific knockout mice indicating that microglia suppress seizure severity in chemoconvulsive models through P2RY12 signaling. During seizures, P2RY12-deficient microglia displayed altered process complexity, accompanied by increased neuronal activation and reduced inhibitory tone. These results link impaired microglial responses to heightened seizure susceptibility and network excitability. Together, our findings establish microglia as protective regulators of seizure activity and identify P2RY12 signaling as a critical mediator of microglia protective actions.",

    "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
    "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

    "title": "Attentional responses to the color exposure sequence of landscape paintings: evidence from fNIRS and eye-tracking",
    "content": "IntroductionColor is a critical determinant of esthetic experience, shaping both immersion and cognitive responses. However, the extent to which the sequence of color exposure modulates the interplay between neural activation and ocular behavior remains insufficiently understood.MethodsTen chromatic landscape paintings were collected and converted into achromatic versions, yielding a total of 20 visual stimuli. Participants were assigned to two conditions: Condition A (achromatic to chromatic) and Condition B (chromatic to achromatic). Visual attention and prefrontal activation were assessed using eye-tracking techniques and functional near-infrared spectroscopy.ResultsAnalyses revealed significantly greater neural activation in Condition A within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.006), left orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043), and right orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043). Eye-tracking metrics indicated longer Total duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.015), Maximum duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.036), and Total duration of whole fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.025) under Condition A. Subjective evaluations also showed significant differences, with higher ratings for Match (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.005) and Feel (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.029).DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that color stimuli exert a decisive influence not only on subjective immersion but also on objective neurocognitive processes. The study extends the scientific foundation of empirical esthetics and offers novel implications for the design of museum and exhibition environments.",

    "content": "Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a chronic secondary headache disorder that develops from excessive analgesic use. The prevalence of MOH is estimated 1\u20132% in the general population, reaching up to 50% among individuals with chronic headache. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MOH remain incompletely understood, neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into its developments. This review synthesizes current evidence demonstrating that MOH is associated with structural and functional alterations in two key neural systems: (1) the pain matrix involved in nociceptive processing, (2) the mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry implicated in addictive behaviors. Importantly, certain structural and functional changes show partial reversibility following medication withdrawal. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to establish causal relationships between these neurobiological changes and the development/maintenance of MOH, which remains essential for developing targeted interventions.",

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

To further understand the implicit attentional and cognitive control processes associated with loneliness, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the relationship between loneliness levels and brain activity underlying attentional capture in a socio-emotional Stroop task. In keeping with previous reports of three-stage processing of socio-emotional words, positive\u2013negative valence and social-individual content of word stimuli were reflected in the amplitude of ERP components associated with high-order perceptual processing and preliminary emotional decoding (P200), emotional and semantic processing (P300), and interference suppression (N450). In the later stage, the differential N450 amplitude associated with processing socially negative compared with control-neutral stimuli was negatively correlated with self-perceived loneliness levels. This finding suggests that social negative and neutral stimuli are processed more dissimilarly at higher levels of self-perceived loneliness, possibly due to increased hypervigilance toward negative social cues, like those associated with rejection or exclusion. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of loneliness on socio-cognitive processing, these findings provide novel insights that can guide future research and inform the development of innovative therapeutic interventions that target the consequences of perceived social disconnection.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo explore the risk factors of cognitive dysfunction in patients with leukoaraiosis (LA) and to construct a predictive model using machine learning.MethodsA total of 273 patients with LA were included. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify independent risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. The patients were divided into a training set (191 cases) and a validation set (82 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. Seven machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, GBDT, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost) were employed to construct predictive models. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, recall, F1 score, MCC, AUROC, and SHAP was used for model interpretation.ResultsUnivariate analysis revealed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, CRP, Fazekas score, and IASA score were associated with cognitive dysfunction (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, Fazekas score, and IASA score were independent risk factors (p < 0.05). Among the machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest model performed the best, with an AUROC of 0.8373 for the validation set. SHAP analysis indicated that age, LDL-C, IASA score, and Fazekas score were the most important predictors.ConclusionThe Random Forest model can be used to predict the risk of cognitive dysfunction in patients with LA, providing a reference for early warning.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "\ud83d\ude80 Introducing MacToast: Modern, customizable toast notifications for MacOS!",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p><strong>mactoast</strong> is a small Python library that displays clean, modern toast-style notifications on macOS. It aims to provide an easy way for scripts, tools, automations, and CLI apps to give lightweight visual feedback\u2014without relying on full macOS Notification Center alerts. Key features:</p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udfe6 Minimal, borderless toast UI (color, size, transparency customizable)</li> <li>\u26a1 One-line usage \u2014 <code>toast(&quot;Hello&quot;)</code></li> <li>\u2611\ufe0f Display SF Symbols and icons</li> <li>\ud83d\udd00 Non-blocking mode so your script keeps running while the toast appears</li> <li>\ud83d\udd14 Various notification sounds</li> <li>\ud83c\udf4e MacOS-native window</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s designed to feel like the lightweight snackbars you see in modern UIs\u2014simple and unobtrusive. I was inspired by Raycast's compact output for command scripts. Link: <a href=\"https://github.com/rafa-rrayes/mactoast\">https://github.com/rafa-rrayes/mactoast</a></p> <p>To install it: <code>pip install mactoast</code></p> <p>Usage:</p> <pre><code>import mactoast mactoast.toast(&quot;hello world!&quot;) </code></pre> <p>Its that easy!</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>mactoast is intended for:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Developers working on macOS</strong> who want simple, lightweight feedback from scripts or tools</li> <li><strong>CLI/terminal users</strong> who want visual cues without printing more text</li> <li><strong>Automation workflows</strong> (e.g., cron jobs, personal scripts) that need a small \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cerror\u201d popup</li> <li><strong>Prototype and hobby projects</strong>, though the library is stable enough to be used in small production utilities It is <strong>not</strong> designed to replace macOS system notifications or handle interactive/clickable alerts. Its focus is purely aesthetic, quick visual feedback.</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Existing options for Python notifications on macOS tend to fall into two categories:</p> <h1>1. System-level notifications (e.g., osascript, pync)</h1> <p>These integrate with the macOS Notification Center. They\u2019re great for long-lived, system-tracked alerts\u2014but:</p> <ul> <li>They require user permission</li> <li>They appear in Notification Center clutter</li> <li>They don\u2019t support custom UI styling</li> <li>They can be slow to display <em>mactoast</em> avoids all of that by using a lightweight custom toast window that appears instantly and disappears cleanly.</li> </ul> <h1>2. GUI frameworks (Tkinter, PyQt, etc.)</h1> <p>You <em>can</em> build custom popups with them, but they:</p> <ul> <li>Require full GUI framework dependencies</li> <li>Aren\u2019t visually consistent with macOS</li> <li>Need more code just to show a tiny message <em>mactoast</em> provides a prebuilt, macOS-native toast that requires <strong>zero GUI setup</strong>.</li> </ul> <h1>How mactoast differs</h1> <ul> <li>\ud83c\udf4f macOS-native window, no external GUI frameworks</li> <li>\ud83c\udfa8 Highly customizable (shape, color, duration, font, position)</li> <li>\u26a1 Extremely lightweight, minimal dependencies</li> <li>\ud83e\uddf1 Dead simple API, built specifically for quick notifications</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rafa_rrayes\"> /u/rafa_rrayes </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmlq1r/introducing_mactoast_modern_customizable_toast/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmlq1r/introducing_mactoast_modern_customizable_toast/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Influenza A infection accelerates disease-associated microglia formation during physiological aging",
    "content": "Severe pneumonia is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, particularly in the elderly. Changes in microglia, the most abundant immune cell population in the brain, are also associated with cognitive decline and dementia, including the emergence of a transcriptional cell state referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). We sought to test the hypothesis that non-neuroinvasive influenza A virus (IAV) pneumonia results in transcriptional responses in brain microglia that drive premature expansion of DAM. Using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, metabolomics, and spatial transcriptomics, we profiled neuroimmune populations in young, middle-aged, and old male mice during IAV infection and recovery. We observed an increased abundance of DAM, interferon-responsive microglia (IRM), CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in white matter regions beginning in middle age and persisting in old animals, irrespective of IAV infection. DAM exhibited a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis with disrupted TCA cycling, citrulline depletion, and an elevated itaconate/-ketoglutarate ratio. Spatial transcriptomic profiling of the human middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in normal agers, SuperAgers, and patients with dementia revealed an analogous accumulation of DAM and CD8+ T cells in white matter. IAV pneumonia induced a transient immunosenescent-like response in microglia, marked by glucocorticoid-responsive gene expression and Ccnd3 upregulation. In response to IAV pneumonia, DAM expanded in middle-aged mice, whereas old mice were elevated at baseline and were largely unaffected by IAV infection. The age-related expansion of DAM was unaffected by pharmacological depletion and repopulation of microglia with a CSF1R antagonist or genetic gain or loss of function of the phagocytic receptor MERTK, suggesting the DAM phenotype is driven by the CNS microenvironment, rather than cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that IAV pneumonia induces an acute immunosenescence response in microglia and accelerates the age-dependent expansion of DAM in white matter.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/reiase/hyperparameter\">Hyperparameter</a> lets you treat function defaults as configurable values. You decorate functions with <code>@ hp.param(&quot;ns&quot;),</code> and it can expose them as CLI subcommands. You can override values via normal CLI args or <code>-D key=value</code> (including keys used inside other functions), with scoped/thread-safe behavior.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Python developers building scripts, internal tools, libraries, or services that need lightweight runtime configuration without passing a cfg object everywhere. It\u2019s usable today; I\u2019m aiming for production-grade behavior, but it\u2019s still early and I\u2019d love feedback.</p> <p><strong>Comparison (vs existing alternatives)</strong></p> <ul> <li>Hydra/OmegaConf: great for experiment configs and plugin ecosystem; Hyperparameter is more embeddable and focuses on runtime scoping + CLI from function signatures (not a full Hydra replacement yet).</li> <li>argparse: great for flags; Hyperparameter adds a config key space + -D overrides + scoping.</li> <li>dynaconf/pydantic-settings: good for settings objects; Hyperparameter is centered on function-level injection and \u201cconfig as a runtime scope\u201d.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Tiny example</strong></p> <pre><code># cli_demo.py import threading import hyperparameter as hp @hp.param(&quot;foo&quot;) def _foo(value=1): return value @hp.param(&quot;greet&quot;) def greet(name: str=&quot;world&quot;, times: int=1): msg = f&quot;Hello {name}, foo={_foo()}&quot; for _ in range(times): print(msg) @hp.param(&quot;worker&quot;) def worker(task: str=&quot;noop&quot;): def child(): print(&quot;[child]&quot;, hp.scope.worker.task()) t = threading.Thread(target=child) t.start(); t.join() if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: hp.launch() python cli_demo.py greet --name Alice --times 2 python cli_demo.py greet -D foo.value=42 python cli_demo.py worker -D worker.task=download </code></pre> <p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/reiase/hyperparameter\">https://github.com/reiase/hyperparameter</a></p> <p>Install: pip install hyperparameter</p> <p>Question: if you\u2019ve built CLIs around config before, what should I prioritize next \u2014 sweepers, output dirs, or shell completion?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ok-reiase\"> /u/ok-reiase </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmhq3d/showcase_hyperparameter_a_small_cli_runtime/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmhq3d/showcase_hyperparameter_a_small_cli_runtime/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "title": "Maintaining a separate async API",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently published a Python package that provides its functionality through both a sync and an async API. Other than the sync/async difference, the two APIs are completely identical. Due to this, there was a lot of copying and pasting around. There was tons of duplicated code, with very few minor, mostly syntactic, differences, for example:</p> <ol> <li>Using <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords.</li> <li>Using <code>asyncio.Queue</code> instead of <code>queue.Queue</code>.</li> <li>Using tasks instead of threads.</li> </ol> <p>So when there was a change in the API's core logic, the exact same change had to be transferred and applied to the async API.</p> <p>This was getting a bit tedious, so I decided to write a Python script that could completely generate the async API from the core sync API by using certain markers in the form of Python comments. I briefly explain how it works <a href=\"https://github.com/manoss96/onlymaps?tab=contributing-ov-file#generating-the-async-api\">here</a>.</p> <p>What do you think of this approach? I personally found it extremely helpful, but I haven't really seen it be done before so I'd like to hear your thoughts. Do you know any other projects that do something similar?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Echoes1996\"> /u/Echoes1996 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pme2nx/maintaining_a_separate_async_api/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pme2nx/maintaining_a_separate_async_api/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>have you seen the Geminids last night? Well, in fact they are still there, but the peak was at around 9 am European Time.</p> <p>Because I just &quot;rejoined&quot; the academic workforce after working in industry for 6 years, I was thinking it is a good time to post something I am currently working on: a space mission instrument that will go to the active asteroid (3200) Phaethon! Ok, I am not posting (for now) my actual work, but I wanted to share with you the astro-dynamical ideas that are behind the scientific conclusion that the Geminids are related to this asteroid.</p> <p>The parameter that allows us to compute dynamical relation is the so called &quot;D_SH&quot; parameter from 1963! And in a short tutorial I explain this parameter and its usage in a Python script. Maybe someone of you wants to learn something about our cosmic vicinity using Python :)?</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/txjo_bNAOrc?si=HLeZ3c3D2-QI7ESf\">https://youtu.be/txjo_bNAOrc?si=HLeZ3c3D2-QI7ESf</a></p> <p>And the correspoding code: <a href=\"https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/CompressedCosmos/CompressedCosmos_Geminids_and_Phaethon.ipynb\">https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/CompressedCosmos/CompressedCosmos_Geminids_and_Phaethon.ipynb</a></p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Thomas</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrAstroThomas\"> /u/MrAstroThomas </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmdshy/the_geminids_meteors_the_active_asteroids/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmdshy/the_geminids_meteors_the_active_asteroids/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "title": "Contextual associations impact visual search across multiple processing stages",
    "content": "Growing evidence indicates that visual search is influenced not only by perceptual but also by semantic information. Among such semantic influences, categorical effects have been extensively studied. By contrast, the influence of contextual associations, that is, how objects commonly co-occur within specific scene contexts, remains less understood. Here, we orthogonally manipulated contextual and categorical relationships between target and distractor objects in a visual search task, while controlling for perceptual target-distractor similarity. By applying linear regression analyses, we modelled behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) from contextual, categorical, and perceptual target-distractor similarity. We found that contextual associations guide attention independently during early processing (modulating the N1pc ERP component), subsequently interact with categorical information (modulating the N2pc), and ultimately shape behavioral search performance jointly with perceptual and categorical similarity. These findings demonstrate that contextual object associations influence visual search across multiple processing stages, thereby supporting attentional guidance in everyday visual tasks.",

    "content": "Many studies have analyzed what organizational features distinguish the left and right hemispheres of the human brain, with most differences typically being found in language areas. In this analysis, we test whether supervised learning can categorize an unseen hemisphere as right or left based on functional connectivity. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we find success to be extremely high (accuracies > .90) in right-handed participants (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [EHI] > 0). Accuracies are still high, but slightly lower when trained on left-handed participants (EHI <= 0). In a third analysis, we test whether the same can be done to identify handedness along with hemisphere chirality. This does not succeed, however, we show that individuals' hemispheres are less distinct the more left-handed they are. Our findings can inform developmental and post-injury work on hemispheric organization.",

    "title": "Striatal pathology in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 mice: A comparative study with Huntingtons disease",
    "content": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Huntingtons disease (HD), are motor diseases caused by CAG expansions in ATXN1 and HTT, where SCA1 shows prominent cerebellar neurodegeneration and HD shows prominent striatal neurodegeneration, particularly in the Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs). Since human and mouse studies demonstrate progressive striatal vulnerability in SCA1, we examined age-dependent molecular, cellular and functional striatal attributes in SCA1 (f-ATXN1146Q/2Q) knockin mice, by assessing RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. Striatal mRNAs are downregulated in SCA1 mice, many in common with HD mice, and specificity in MSNs is supported by the rescue of transcriptomic dysregulation with deletion of mutant Ataxin1 from MSNs. Immunohistochemistry assessed dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) and 2 (D2R) expression in indirect and direct MSNs. In HD mice (HttQ175/Q7), expression of both D1R and D2R proteins in MSNs decreased with age in parallel with their RNA levels. In the SCA1 mouse striatum, D1R protein expression decreased with age as seen in murine HD striatum. In contrast, while D2R protein level was decreased similar to D1R protein at 5-weeks of age, by 40-weeks expression of D2R protein recovered to levels recorded in WT mice. Electrophysiological assessment showed a reduction of excitatory synaptic transmission in SCA1 mouse MSNs, indicating functional deficits early in disease. In contrast to cerebellar and many other aspects of SCA1 pathology known to depend on proper nuclear localization of ATXN1 with an expanded polyglutamine, mutating ATXN1s nuclear localization failed to correct striatal MSN RNA and protein downregulations, indicating a difference in how ATXN1 exerts its pathological effects between the cerebellum and the striatum. Together, these data provide a molecular and cellular basis of striatal pathology in SCA1.",

    "content": "Silent visual reading is accompanied by the phenomenological experience of an inner voice. However, the temporal dynamics and functional role of the underlying neural representations remain unclear. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data while humans read naturalistic narratives, and applied computational modelling to isolate time-resolved auditory from visual and semantic representations. Our results revealed robust auditory representations during silent reading that were not explained by visual or semantic features, emerging already before word onset. These auditory representations mimicked the sequence of sounds of the corresponding words in a fine-grained manner, revealing a candidate basis for the phenomenological experience of hearing an inner voice while reading. Finally, we show that auditory word representations exhibit a key signature of predictive processing: they are stronger for unexpected than expected words. More specifically, early auditory features contribute to predictions before word onset, whereas later features only contribute after word onset, suggesting distinct prediction stages. Together our results reveal the temporal dynamics and functional role of auditory representations in silent reading.",

    "title": "Visual working memory representations of naturalistic images in early visual cortex are not sensory-like",
    "content": "For a long time, working memory was considered to reflect sustained activity in prefrontal and parietal areas. This has been challenged by the \"sensory recruitment model\" according to which sensory areas are involved in maintaining working memory representations. The main support for this comes from the finding that working memory contents can be decoded from early sensory areas during memory delay periods. However, the availability of stimulus-related information in sensory regions does not reveal whether this information is encoded in a sensory format, i.e. in the same way as sensory stimuli. Alternatively, working memory contents could be encoded in independent formats or even potentially undergo dynamic changes throughout the delay. Here, we test this question directly by requiring participants to briefly memorise naturalistic object-scenes. We directly compared the way early visual regions encoded the contents during perception and working memory maintenance. As in previous studies, we found robust stimulus-related information in early visual cortex throughout the delay. However, despite continuously robust information, the encoding of memory contents in the later delay period did not occur in the same format as during pure perception. Thus, despite the fact that sensory areas have working-memory-related information, the format of this information is not strictly sensory-like throughout the delay.",

    "content": "Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication in the central nervous system (CNS) and are emerging as biomarkers of brain health and disease. However, the molecular composition of cell type-specific brain EVs, particularly astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs), remains poorly defined. Methods: We performed comparative proteomic analysis of neuronal (NDEVs), microglial (MDEVs), and astrocytic (ADEVs) from mouse brain using magnetic immunocapture and LC-MS/MS proteomic profiling. Results: Each EV subtype displayed distinct molecular fingerprints. NDEVs were enriched in synaptic proteins and neurogenesis-related proteins (e.g., APP and BDNF), whereas MDEVs contained immune and phagocytic markers (e.g., CX3CR1). Strikingly, the ADEV proteome closely mirrored the recently characterized GlialCAM interactome from leukodystrophy research, encompassing GlialCAM/MLC1 and associated partners involved in ion and water homeostasis (EAAT1/2, AQP4, GJA1), together with GPCRs such as GPRC5B. This overlap suggests that ADEVs encapsulate a molecular scaffold characteristic of astrocytic endfeet, potentially extending their signaling functions to the extracellular space. Conclusion: Our study provides a detailed comparative proteomic characterization of brain cell-type specific EVs, revealing that ADEVs contain the GlialCAM/MLC1 network and GPCRs. These findings position ADEVs as promising candidates for EV-based biomarkers and mechanistic studies in CNS disorders.",

Using a novel fMRI paradigm, we identify a set of prosody-responsive brain areas and then richly characterize them across 8 experiments (25 experimental conditions; n=51 participants). These areas--located on the lateral temporal surface bilaterally and in the frontal lobe--respond to the presence of prosody in both meaningful and meaningless speech, and are distinct from nearby temporal pitch- and speech-perception areas and from frontal areas sensitive to general cognitive and attentional demands. They are also dissociable from--but show partial overlap with--the language areas and with the area that processes dynamic facial expressions. Thus, prosodic information is processed by a distinct set of brain areas, which may help integrate linguistic meanings with non-verbal communicative signals.",

    "content": "Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN2A, a sodium channel gene expressed in cortical pyramidal (PYR) cells, lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autism, intellectual disability, and cortical sensory dysfunction. In Scn2a+/- mice, PYR dendritic excitability and synapses are impaired, but cortical information processing deficits are unknown. In the whisker somatosensory cortex, we found strongly degraded somatotopic tuning of PYR cells, profoundly blurred whisker maps, and impaired population coding, despite normal overall firing rates. This constitutes a robust biomarker for Scn2a-related cortical dysfunction. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were also unexpectedly hypofunctional. We tested for rescue of coding deficits in post-critical period, young adult mice by viral delivery of CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) reagents that upregulate Scn2a. CRISPRa treatment normalized cortical sensory representations at the single-unit and map levels. This suggests that therapy to increase Scn2a expression may be effective in normalizing cortical function in Scn2a loss-of-function disorder, even in older children or adults.",

    "title": "The hierarchical organization of human praxis: A lesion-connectome mapping study of limb and oral apraxias",
    "content": "The neural architecture underlying apraxias remains a complex puzzle. While primary motor cortices exhibit clear somatotopic organization, it is unclear whether this segregation extends to the higher-order networks governing skilled actions. Furthermore, the dissociation between verbal (apraxia of speech, AOS) and non-verbal (buccofacial apraxia, BFA) oral motor control remains debated. We investigated the neuroanatomical substrates of limb apraxia (LA), BFA, and AOS in 136 patients with acute left-hemisphere ischemic stroke using voxel-based, region-of-interest-based, and connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping. Our results revealed a fundamental anatomical dissociation extending beyond simple effector specificity. LA was associated with damage to the inferior parietal lobule and widespread white matter disconnections, specifically involving intra-hemispheric temporo-parietal pathways and massive inter-hemispheric transcallosal fibers. In contrast, BFA was attributable to focal cortical lesions centered on the ventral precentral and postcentral gyri, without significant involvement of long-range white matter tracts. AOS showed no significant lesion overlap at the population level, suggesting a highly focal etiology distinct from the premotor patterns of BFA. These findings indicate that LA and BFA differ not only in their effectors but in their network dependency: LA relies on a distributed, bilaterally integrated temporo-parietal network for multimodal action control, whereas BFA depends on localized proprioceptive-motor loops in the ventral sensorimotor cortex. This study provides a structural framework for the hierarchical organization of human praxis, distinguishing between distributed network disconnections and focal cortical dysfunctions.",

    "title": "Conserved phenotype and function of human brain border-associated macrophages in iPSC-derived models",
    "content": "Border-associated macrophages (BAMs) are increasingly implicated in protective brain functions including the removal of pathogenic material such as amyloid-beta. However, there is a lack of available and deeply characterized human BAM models. Here, we report that postnatal transplantation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived hematopoietic progenitors to the murine brain sufficiently chimerizes the brain border immune compartment to allow functional interrogations. Human xenotransplanted BAMs (xBAMs) line the leptomeninges and brain vasculature beyond the glia limitans. Via single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that a conserved transcriptional signature distinguishes BAMs from microglia across species origin, age, and genetic background. Both xBAMs and murine BAMs are defined by a hyper-endocytic phenotype and function, surpass other brain macrophages in acute amyloid-beta scavenging, and exhibit compartment-restricted sampling of parenchymal material. Using a modified differentiation protocol, we find that we can generate iPS-derived BAM-like cells (iBAMs) in vitro, which are also characterized by a hyper-endocytic phenotype and enhanced engulfment capacity relative to iPS-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs). Together, these data define a conserved hyper-endocytic BAM phenotype and provide a toolbox for studying human BAMs both in vivo and in vitro.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>!</p> <p>I just built and released a new open-source project: <strong>Pydantic-DeepAgents</strong> \u2013 a Python Deep Agent framework built on top of Pydantic-AI.</p> <p>Check out the repo here: <a href=\"https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents?referrer=grok.com\">https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents</a></p> <p>Stars, forks, and PRs are welcome if you're interested!</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong><br /> Pydantic-DeepAgents is a framework that enables developers to rapidly build and deploy production-grade autonomous AI agents. It extends Pydantic-AI by providing advanced agent capabilities such as planning, filesystem operations, subagent delegation, and customizable skills. Agents can process tasks autonomously, handle file uploads, manage long conversations through summarization, and support human-in-the-loop workflows. It includes multiple backends for state management (e.g., in-memory, filesystem, Docker sandbox), rich toolsets for tasks like to-do lists and skills, structured outputs via Pydantic models, and full streaming support for responses.</p> <p>Key features include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Multiple Backends</strong>: StateBackend (in-memory), FilesystemBackend, DockerSandbox, CompositeBackend</li> <li><strong>Rich Toolsets</strong>: TodoToolset, FilesystemToolset, SubAgentToolset, SkillsToolset</li> <li><strong>File Uploads</strong>: Upload files for agent processing with run_with_files() or deps.upload_file()</li> <li><strong>Skills System</strong>: Extensible skill definitions with markdown prompts</li> <li><strong>Structured Output</strong>: Type-safe responses with Pydantic models via output_type</li> <li><strong>Context Management</strong>: Automatic conversation summarization for long sessions</li> <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop</strong>: Built-in support for human confirmation workflows</li> <li><strong>Streaming</strong>: Full streaming support for agent responses</li> </ul> <p>I've also included a demo application built on this framework \u2013 check out the full app example in the repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents/tree/main/examples/full_app?referrer=grok.com\">https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents/tree/main/examples/full_app</a></p> <p>Plus, here's a quick demo video: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqgXkbAgUrsKOWpfWdF48cqaxRht-8od/view?usp=sharing&amp;referrer=grok.com\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqgXkbAgUrsKOWpfWdF48cqaxRht-8od/view?usp=sharing</a></p> <p>And don't miss the screenshot in the README for a visual overview!</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong><br /> Compared to popular open-source agent frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI, Pydantic-DeepAgents is more tightly integrated with Pydantic for type-safe, structured data handling, making it lighter-weight and easier to extend for production use. Unlike AutoGen (which focuses on multi-agent collaboration), it emphasizes deep agent features like customizable skills and backends (e.g., Docker sandbox for isolation), while avoiding the complexity of larger ecosystems. It's an extension of Pydantic-AI, so it inherits its simplicity but adds agent-specific tools that aren't native in base Pydantic-AI or simpler libraries like Semantic Kernel.</p> <p>Thanks! \ud83d\ude80</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VanillaOk4593\"> /u/VanillaOk4593 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pm6pu5/pydanticdeepagents_autonomous_agents_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pm6pu5/pydanticdeepagents_autonomous_agents_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Integrative Analysis of Spatial Transcriptome and Connectome by SpaCon",
    "content": "The brain's structure and function arise from its complex molecular composition and neural connectivity, yet the relationship between cell-type-specific gene expression and brain-wide connectivity is not well understood. By integrating single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics and connectomics, we reveal a tight coupling between gene expression and anatomical connectivity in the cortico-thalamic circuit, and identify specific gene expression in axons of the corpus callosum that reflect their cortical origins. Building on these findings, we developed SpaCon, a graph attention autoencoder that uses a tunable hyperparameter to flexibly integrate global connectivity with local gene expression. To enable analysis at the whole-brain scale, SpaCon introduces an efficient neighbor sampling strategy that drastically reduces computational requirements without compromising performance. This architecture allows the model to identify functionally relevant three-dimensional domains defined by both molecular identity and shared connectivity patterns, even when spatially distant. Validated across diverse datasets and species, SpaCon significantly enhances the prediction of connectivity from gene expression and improves the spatial classification of neuronal subtypes. SpaCon thus provides a powerful, scalable, and versatile framework for understanding the complex relationship between transcriptome and connectome.",

    "title": "Intra- and Interhemispheric Signatures of Criticality at the Onset of Synchronization",
    "content": "The cerebral cortex must flexibly alternate between locally segregated activity that supports specialization and long-range interactions that enable integration. How cortical networks balance these competing demands remains unclear. We propose that fluctuations around a critical point between ordered and disordered phases provide a natural framework to understand coordinated neuronal activity across scales. Using simultaneous spiking recordings from the left and right prefrontal cortex (PFC) of freely behaving rats, we found that signatures of criticality emerged at the onset of neuronal synchronization, both locally within individual hemispheres and globally across the combined population. Over time, cortical activity explored a continuum of intra- and interhemispheric synchrony levels, including states in which neurons were locally desynchronized yet maintained interhemispheric coupling. A computational model operating near its critical regime reproduced these empirical patterns, capturing the characteristic relationship between local and long-range coordination. These results suggest that cortical networks achieve flexible transitions between local and global computation by fluctuating around a critical regime.",

    "title": "Distance of bipolar re-referencing imparts nonlinear frequency-specific influences on intracranial recording signal measurements",
    "content": "Obective. Bipolar re-referencing (BPRR), in which one electrode\u2019s signal is subtracted from a neighboring electrode to produce a differential signal, can improve signal readability and refine localization for intracranial electroencephalography. There is wide variation in manufactured electrode array spacing, yet how BPRR affects specific frequencies at precise inter-electrode distances has not been systematically evaluated. Approach. Intracranial recordings with uniquely large numbers of electrodes were obtained for sixteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We evaluated combinations of high-density subdural grid, depth, and strip electrodes (n = 3,664, 742, and 336) with manufactured linear inter-electrode distances of 4, 5, and 10 mm, respectively. BPRR was performed using all possible electrode pairs (n = 445 305 grid, 16 004 depth, 3278 strip) spanning distances from 2\u201360 mm. Multi-taper power spectra were generated separately for grid, depth, and strip contacts. Distances were consolidated across patients and anatomical areas for generalizability, and distance-related influences on task-related brain activity and quantitative interictal epileptiform discharge localization were evaluated. Main results. We identified 8 mm as a consistent reversal point for BPRR, below which low-frequency signals (<30 Hz) had consistently decreased power, and higher frequencies had increased power. Larger distances increased all broadband (2\u2013200 Hz) signals. Task-related increases in superior temporal gyrus 50\u2013200 Hz activity were consistently enhanced across 4\u201340 mm bipolar distances. There were non-significant difference trends between 4 and 8 mm re-referencing on epileptiform discharge detection. Significance. BPRR distance imposed specific transition points for distance and frequency (roughly 8 mm and \u223c30 Hz, respectively) that produced differential effects on measurements of signal power. The consistency across brain regions and electrode types (depth, subdural) suggests these influences are physical brain bio-signal properties, potentially related to spatial wavelength of periodic oscillations in lower frequencies in contrast to more aperiodic activity in higher frequencies. A distance-frequency relation map is provided to help optimize neural signal biomarker quality for intracranial applications by guiding strategic re-referencing distance selection.",

    "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, a non-invasive spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope to restore functions in individuals with paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy, stroke and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are relatively few options for such stimulation devices compared to conventional stimulators commonly used for neuromuscular electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation, particularly for people with neurological conditions in the developing countries. Approach. In this report, we present OpenXstim, an open-source, two-channel programmable electrical stimulator developed to advance research in non-invasive muscle, nerve, or spinal cord stimulation treatments. Main results. OpenXstim can deliver current pulses up to 110 mA with a compliance voltage of 96 V per channel. In benchtop testing, we found that the stimulator successfully generates high frequency (9 kHz) burst stimulation, a mode commonly used for spinal cord neuromodulation. The stimulator was further tested in two individuals with SCI and showed preliminary indications of functional improvement. However, large controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. Although special care was taken in the design of the stimulator to ensure user safety, users are strongly warned to handle the device with utmost caution, as it can generate high voltage and current that may cause adverse health effects if not used properly. Significance. This programmable, open-source stimulator offers tangible hope for improving the accessibility of non-invasive neuromodulation treatments for people with paralysis worldwide. The design and complete source-code of the stimulator are freely available online in a public repository: https://github.com/OpenMedTech-Lab/OpenXstim",

    "content": "Although many animals rely on visual information to navigate, optic flow is inherently ambiguous as it confounds information about motion speed and object distance. As a result, the visual feedback produced by a given motor command is context-dependent and requires an appropriately adapted response. Recent experiments have investigated how the fish Danionella cerebrum use visual cues to stabilize their position against simulated external currents. Logarithmic sensorimotor transformations have been proposed to enable adaptive responses to perturbations while preventing delay-induced instabilities. Here, we develop the theoretical framework introduced for continuous locomotion to show how logarithmic coding naturally gives rise to this adaptive behavior. The system is modeled by a nonlinear delay differential equation, which is analyzed using dynamical systems theory. We further analyze experimental data to uncover the mechanisms underlying swimming initiation and positional drift correction. Finally, we extend our framework to intermittent locomotion, resulting in a nonlinear difference equation, and show that it still produces robust adaptive behavior. This is motivated by the literature on zebrafish, where visuomotor stabilization has been extensively studied, but burst-and-coast swimming obscures the underlying adaptation mechanism. We show that our theory can reproduce the experimental results reported for motor adaptation in zebrafish without invoking internal models. Overall, our results highlight logarithmic coding as a unifying principle for visuomotor stability across continuous and intermittent locomotor regimes.",

    "title": "Spectral brain connectivity in dementia: coherence, imaginary coherence and partial coherence analysis of EEG signals",
    "content": "Objective. As the prevalence of dementia continues to rise, the need for accurate and early diagnostic tools becomes increasingly critical. Despite diverse underlying causes, dementia types share common cognitive symptoms, making accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Approach: This study investigates electroencephalographic (EEG)-based spectral brain connectivity in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD, ), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, ), and healthy controls (HCs, ), with the dual aim of identifying condition-specific connectivity patterns and evaluating three coherence-based connectivity measures: coherence, imaginary coherence, and partial coherence. Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data (19 channels) were analyzed, and connectivity was estimated across frequencies to assess both global and local network alterations. Main results. The results indicate that dementias (both AD and FTD) are characterized by decreased connectivity in higher frequency bands and increased connectivity in lower frequencies, reflecting respectively impaired neural communication and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates with the spatial extent and magnitude of connectivity disruptions. Notably, partial coherence\u2014unlike coherence and imaginary coherence\u2014effectively distinguishes between the AD and FTD groups, suggesting that direct connectivity measures may provide more discriminative information for differential diagnosis. Significance. These findings highlight the potential of EEG-based spectral connectivity analysis, particularly partial coherence, as a non-invasive tool to aid in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes, supporting early clinical decision-making.",

    "title": "Evaluating group interactions in epileptic brain networks by hypergraph and higher-order homophily",
    "content": "Objective. Group interactions capture cooperative dynamics among neural populations quantitatively, while also enabling precise detection of ensemble-level synchrony patterns and transcending the limitations of node-level relationships. To evaluate higher-order group interactions, we propose the PLASSO-homophily framework using multichannel stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recorded from patients with epilepsy. Approach. Specifically, we use phase locking value to improve least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method for constructing hypergraphs. Afterwards, we calculate affinity ratios between brain zones. Finally, we investigate higher-order interactions among different groups from a homophily perspective. The extremal result of strict homophily serves as a crucial theoretical framework for understanding homophily concepts, reflecting the constraints that different groups follow in higher-order interactions. Main results. It is observed that group interactions between seizure onset zones (SOZ), propagation zones (PZ) and non-involved zones (NIZ) present significant distinction across different seizure phases. In particular, the homophily of SOZ reaches a peak point during the seizure and sharply decreases in the post-seizure, with the most statistically significant differences on and bands. Furthermore, during the seizure, SOZ-PZ exhibits enhanced coupling while SOZ-NIZ exhibits impaired functional integration. Finally, among three groups, only SOZ exhibits strict monotonic and majority homophily. Significance. By analyzing changes in in-class and out-class connectivity, we quantitatively assess the activity levels and combinatorial constraints of the SOZ, PZ, and NIZ, thereby providing a novel perspective for exploring seizure mechanisms and developing epilepsy treatments.",

    "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
    "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

    "content": "Physical constraints in the brain favor short, distance-dependent connections. However, short-range projections are not merely a compromise imposed by these constraints; they also serve essential functional roles. Here, we explore networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, demonstrating that short excitatory projections fundamentally increase the number of common presynaptic inputs, thereby enhancing the correlations of neural responses. Strengthened recurrent correlations can lead to bursting states, amplifying postsynaptic neuronal activity and supporting signal propagation over long distances within the network. Moreover, even without an explicitly imposed modular structure, short excitatory connections can give rise to functional clustering and support a broad spectrum of modular functions. Therefore, this structural principle provides a mechanistic basis for functional column formation and dynamic burst propagation, suggesting that the brain transforms structural wiring constraints into opportunities for complex computation and distributed processing. These findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of how the brain transforms structural limitations into opportunities for complex computation.",

    "title": "EEG Reveals Robust Within-Person but Unstable Between-Person Neural Encoding of Pain",
    "content": "The perception of pain varies both within and between individuals, even when sensory input remains constant. Understanding how the brain encodes these intra- and interindividual variations is essential for elucidating the neural mechanisms of pain in health and disease. Yet, previous findings have been inconsistent, and their robustness, in terms of both repeatability and replicability, has remained unclear. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in 161 healthy participants to re-investigate the neural correlates of intra- and inter-individual variations in the perception of brief painful stimuli, independent of stimulus intensity. Using Bayesian multivariate multi-model regression, we related pain ratings to evoked (N1, N2, P2) and induced oscillatory responses (alpha, beta, gamma). To assess the robustness of our findings, the experiment was repeated after four weeks in the same participants and replicated in an independent cohort (n = 111). This design allowed us to examine within-person variability at both short (moment-to-moment) and long (day-to-day) timescales. Inter-individual differences in pain were primarily associated with the P2 response, an effect that was repeatable in the same but not replicable in the independent cohort. In contrast, intra-individual variations were explained by a multicomponent EEG pattern that was both repeatable across time and replicable across cohorts. These findings demonstrate that intra- and inter-individual variability in pain is differentially encoded in the human brain and reveal greater robustness of within-person brain-behavior associations. EEG markers may therefore be more suitable for tracking longitudinal changes in pain within individuals than for comparing pain sensitivity across individuals.",

    "content": "Flexible behaviour requires transforming abstract cognitive representations, such as value preferences, into concrete motor actions. During economic decision-making, individuals evaluate options to guide choices and then transform these choices into specific actions to obtain rewards, yet the neural circuit mechanisms linking abstract choices to spatial actions remain unclear. Here we show that a frontal motor network performs this transformation through dynamic circuit reconfiguration across decision stages. Using a mouse task that temporally dissociates value-guided decisions from spatial action planning, cortex-wide optogenetic perturbations revealed that a specific frontal motor circuit was causally required for both abstract and motor stages of choice. Electrophysiological recordings during abstract decision-making showed that frontal motor neurons encoded option values and economic choices independently of sensorimotor contingencies, and unilateral silencing impaired decisions without spatial bias. During spatial planning, value and spatial signals were integrated to guide action selection, and unilateral silencing produced an ipsilateral bias. A dynamical model captured this transformation, predicting a shift from distributed interhemispheric maintenance of economic choice to lateralized control of actions, which we validated with simultaneous bilateral recordings. These findings demonstrate how frontal motor circuits reconfigure their interactions to convert cognitive decisions into motor actions, providing a circuit-level mechanism for flexible, value-guided behaviour.",

The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

    "title": "Evaluating the effects of regularization and cross-validation parameters on the performance of SVM-based decoding of EEG data",
    "content": "Regularization has been extensively used in multivariate pattern classification (MVPA; decoding) of EEG data to mitigate the risk of overfitting. N-fold cross-validation is also used to mitigate this risk, and it is often combined with averaging across trials to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the impact of different regularization and cross-validation parameters on decoding performance remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of variations in the support vector machine (SVM) regularization parameter (C) and the number of crossfolds (and the number of trials per average) on the performance of SVM-based decoding analyses. To achieve this, we examined the decoding performance in relatively simple binary classification tasks from seven commonly used event-related potential paradigms (N170, mismatch negativity, N2pc, P3b, N400, lateralized readiness potential, and error-related negativity). Additionally, we evaluated the decoding performance in more challenging multiclass tasks, including decoding face identity, facial expression, stimulus location, and stimulus orientation. The results revealed that both decoding accuracy and effect size were highest when the regularization strength was equal to or greater than 1. Furthermore, using between 3 and 5 folds with at least 10 trials per average yielded optimal decoding performance in most cases. Researchers applying SVM-based decoding to datasets similar to those examined here-in terms of population, recording systems, class numbers, and paradigms-might benefit from using the parameters that we found to be optimal here.",

    "title": "Intrinsic persistent firing in CA1 encodes elapsed time across behaviorally relevant scales",
    "content": "The ability to encode and maintain temporal relationships is crucial for learning, predicting, and forming episodic memories. While hippocampal time cells and entorhinal temporal context cells are well-established in vivo, it remains unclear whether single neurons can sustain representations of elapsed time over multi-second intervals, independent of synaptic drive. Here, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rodent hippocampal CA1 slices under synaptic blockade, we show that following a brief current pulse, many neurons exhibit exponentially decaying firing rates with a broad distribution of time constants extending to tens of seconds. This indicates that single neurons possess intrinsic mechanisms capable of covering behaviorally relevant temporal scales. These results highlight that single neurons can encode temporal information over more than an order of magnitude, providing a potential cellular substrate for temporal coding in the brain.",

    "title": "Systematic comparison of color representations between humans and deep neural networks: towards predicting human color perception in a vast color space",
    "content": "The representational structure of human color perception, particularly within vast color spaces, remains incompletely understood. While representational structures for dozens of colors have been studied, exploring structures spanning hundreds or thousands of colors has been infeasible due to the time costs of psychophysical experiments. Given these constraints, deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted attention as a promising tool for providing proxies or predictions of human perception beyond the scope of psychophysical experiments. However, it remains unclear which DNN models possess internal representations that geometrically align with human color perception. Furthermore, it is unclear which learning paradigm enables DNNs to acquire a color representation that is geometrically aligned with that of humans. Here, we systematically investigate which learning paradigm enables DNNs to produce a color representation that is structurally congruent with that of humans, with a focus on three types: self-supervised learning (SSL) that trains on images alone, supervised learning (SL) that trains on images with category labels, and contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) that trains on image-text pairs. We compared internal representations of DNNs with the human similarity judgments of 93 colors using a rigorous unsupervised method termed Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT), which reveals whether the representational structures of humans and models align at the fine-item level. Our results show that only the CLIP paradigm acquires color representations that strongly align with human data at the fine-item level. Furthermore, when we leveraged a key advantage of DNNs and investigated a substantial representational structure of 4096 colors, the human-aligned CLIP models consistently converged on a non-trivial distorted ring-like structure, which presents a plausible prediction for the large-scale human color representation. Our work demonstrates an approach for exploring unknown territories of human perception through the use of computational models validated in a limited empirical space, and provides predictions for future large-scale psychophysical experiments.",

    "title": "Software and pipelines for registration and analyses of rodent brain image data in reference atlas space",
    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

No manual provisioning. Dependencies are resolved in code with proper ordering. Swap from Docker to staging by changing one class; Your behavioral tests are now truly separated from the environment.</p> <p><strong>vs. testcontainers alone:</strong> BehaveDock adds the abstraction layer. You define blueprints (interfaces) and providers (implementations) separately. This means you can mock a database in unit tests, spin up Postgres in CI, and point to a real staging DB in integration\u2014without changing test code.</p> <h1>Repository</h1> <p>I really appreciate any feedback on my work.

    "title": "Super-resolution microscopy and deep learning methods: what can they bring to neuroscience: from neuron to 3D spine segmentation",
    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",
