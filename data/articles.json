To date, the performance of the trim and fill\nmethod has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more\ncomprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in\na number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those\nfrom usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely\nuse of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in\nthe meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the\nperformance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study\nheterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive\neffect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is\npresent the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than\nthe usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate\nfrom the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the\npresence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our\nsimulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the\npresence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce\nthe bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not\nideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly\ncaused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the\nperformance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various\nmeta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form\nof sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.2889&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n17476644&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;4544-4562&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Performance\nof the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and\nbetween-study\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Peters&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jaime\nL.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Sutton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Alex\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;David\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Abrams&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Keith\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Rushton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lesley&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2007&quot;,11,10]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/DMQP989N&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;It\nis known that the existence of publication bias can influence the conclusions\nof a meta-analysis. Some methods have been developed to deal with publication\nbias, but issues remain. One particular method called 'trim and fill' is\ndesigned to adjust for publication bias. The method, which is intuitively\nappealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a simple and\npopular graphical tool called the funnel plot. We present a simulation study\ndesigned to evaluate the behaviour of this method. Our results indicate that\nwhen the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they estimate different\neffects), trim and fill may inappropriately adjust for publication bias where\nnone exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously adjust for non-existent\nbias if (i) the variability among studies causes some precisely estimated\nstudies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii) an inverse\nrelationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is introduced by the\nstudies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest that the funnel plot\nitself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses. Selection modelling is\nan alternative method warranting further study. It performed better than trim\nand fill in our simulations, although its frequency of convergence varied,\ndepending on the simulation parameters.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.1461&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n12820277&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;2113-2126&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Adjusting\nfor publication bias in the presence of\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Terrin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Norma&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schmid&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Christopher\nH.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lau&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joseph&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Olkin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ingram&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2003&quot;,7,15]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Peters\net al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

Specifying a\nrange of values around zero allows researchers to statistically reject the\npresence of effects large enough to matter, and prevents practically\ninsignificant effects from being interpreted as a statistically significant\ndifference. We compare the behavior of the recently proposed second generation\np-value (Blume, D\u2019Agostino McGowan, Dupont, &amp; Greevy, 2018) with the more\nestablished Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) equivalence testing procedure\n(Schuirmann, 1987). We show that the two approaches yield almost identical\nresults under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g., when the\nconfidence interval is wider than the equivalence range, or when confidence\nintervals are asymmetric) the second generation p-value becomes difficult to\ninterpret. The second generation p-value is interpretable in a dichotomous\nmanner (i.e., when the SGPV equals 0 or 1 because the confidence intervals lies\ncompletely within or outside of the equivalence range), but this dichotomous\ninterpretation does not require calculations. We conclude that equivalence\ntests yield more consistent p-values, distinguish between datasets that yield\nthe same second generation p-value, and allow for easier control of Type I and\nType II error rates.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.933&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Daniel Lakens, Marie Delacre&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;1-11&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Equivalence\nTesting and the Second Generation\nP-Value&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Delacre&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marie&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,7,13]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lakens\n&amp; Delacre, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

In\nthis article we assume that the overall goal researchers wish to achieve is to\nmaximize the utility gained by conducting the replication study. We then\npropose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the\nreplication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The\nreplication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we\ncould gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a)\nthe value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim\nbased on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal\ndecision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph\nmodeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of\nexpected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative\nestimates of replication value.

Replicating\nresearchers will therefore often have to decide which of several relevant\ncandidates to target for replication. Formal strategies for efficient study\nselection have been proposed, but none have been explored for practical\nfeasibility \u2013 a prerequisite for validation. Here we move one step closer to\nefficient replication study selection by exploring the feasibility of a\nparticular selection strategy that estimates replication value as a function of\ncitation impact and sample size (Isager, van 't Veer, &amp; Lakens, 2021). We\ntested our strategy on a sample of fMRI studies in social neuroscience. We\nfirst report our efforts to generate a representative candidate set of\nreplication targets. We then explore the feasibility and reliability of\nestimating replication value for the targets in our set, resulting in a dataset\nof 1358 studies ranked on their value of prioritising them for replication.

Here,\nwe present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of\nthe most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might\nrealistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several\nlevels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity,\nand used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature.

We give exact theoretical results showing\nhow selection for significance affects the distribution of statistical power in\na heterogeneous population of significance tests. In a set of large-scale\nsimulation studies, we compare four methods for estimating population mean\npower of a set of studies selected for significance (a maximum likelihood\nmodel, extensions of p-curve and p-uniform, &amp;amp; z-curve). The p-uniform\nand p-curve methods performed well with a fixed effects size and varying sample\nsizes. However, when there was substantial variability in effect sizes as well\nas sample sizes, both methods systematically overestimate mean power. With\nheterogeneity in effect sizes, the maximum likelihood model produced the most\naccurate estimates when the distribution of effect sizes matched the\nassumptions of the model, but z-curve produced more accurate estimates when the\nassumptions of the maximum likelihood model were not met. We recommend the use\nof z-curve to estimate the typical power of significant results, which has\nimplications for the replicability of significant results in psychology\njournals.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.874&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Jerry Brunner, Ulrich\nSchimmack&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Estimating\nPopulation Mean Power Under Conditions of Heterogeneity and Selection for\nSignificance&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/874&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Brunner&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jerry&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schimmack&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ulrich&quot;}],&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2022&quot;,3,16]]},&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,5,31]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Brunner\n&amp; Schimmack, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">It seems a\nbit of a stretch to say the p-curve method did not get scrutiny appropriate to\nits popularity when there were many papers that criticized it, relatively\nquickly </span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:\nEN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span>ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION\n{&quot;citationID&quot;:&quot;LqMzfpTk&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;formattedCitation&quot;:&quot;(Aert\net al., 2016; Bishop &amp; Thompson, 2016; Ulrich &amp; Miller, 2018)&quot;,&quot;plainCitation&quot;:&quot;(Aert\net al., 2016; Bishop &amp; Thompson, 2016; Ulrich &amp; Miller,\n2018)&quot;,&quot;noteIndex&quot;:0},&quot;citationItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1415,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/B8XNF95F&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:1415,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Because\nof overwhelming evidence of publication bias in psychology, techniques to\ncorrect meta-analytic estimates for such bias are greatly needed.

The properties of\np-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of\nthese simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be\nused as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a\ncertain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually\ndemonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous\nmathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined\nwithout simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any\nstatistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough\nevaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions\np-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition,\nwe used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of\npublication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence\nthe shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than\n1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also\nsuggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an\narticle as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level.\nThis gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of\nreal effects even when no such effects are actually present.

What is fair to say is that\nstatisticians failed to engage with an incredibly important topic (test for\npublication bias) that addressed a clear need in many scientific communities,\nas most of the criticism was by psychological methodologists. I fully agree\nthat statisticians should have engaged more with this technique. I believe the\nreason that they didn\u2019t is because there is a real problem in the reward\nstructure in statistics, where statisticians get greater rewards inside their\nfield by proposing a 12<sup>th</sup> approach to compute confidence intervals\naround a non-parametric effect size estimate for a test that no one uses, than\nto help psychologists solve a problem they really need a solution for. Indeed,\nfor a statistician, publication bias is a very messy business, and there will\nnever be a sufficiently rigorous test for publication bias to get credit from\nfellow statisticians. There are no beautiful mathematical solutions, no\ncreative insights, there is only the messy reality of a literature that is\nbiased by human actions that we can never adequately capture in a model. The\nfact that empirical researchers often don\u2019t know where to begin to evaluate the\nreliability of claims in their publication-bias-ridden field is not something\nstatisticians care about.

Journal peer review will not\nsuffice, because it is only as good as the two or three peers that happen to be\nwilling and available to review a paper. But it is a start. We should enable\nresearchers to see how well papers are peer reviewed by journals.

Morey and Davis-Stober point out the limitations of simulation-based\ntests of a method and convincingly argue for the value of evaluating the\nmathematical properties of a testing procedure. If as a field we agree that an\nevaluation of the mathematical properties of a test is desirable, we should\ntrack whether this evaluation has been performed, or not. We could have a long\nchecklist of desirable quality control standards \u2013 e.g., a method has been\ntested on real datasets, it has been compared to similar methods, those\ncomparisons have been performed objectively based on a well-justified set of\ncriteria, etc. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One could\ncreate a database where for each method the quality standards that have been\nmet and that have not been met are listed. If considered useful, the database\ncould also track how often a method is used, by tracking citations, and listing\npapers that have implemented the method (as opposed to those merely discussing\nthe method). When statistical methods become widely used, the database would point\nresearchers to which methods deserve more scrutiny. The case of magnitude-based\ninference in sport science reveals the importance of a public call for scrutiny\nwhen a method becomes widely popular, especially when this popularity is\nlimited to a single field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The more\ncomplex methods are, the more limitations they have. This will be true for all\nmethods that aim to deal with publication bias, because the way scientists bias\nthe literature is difficult to quantify. Maybe as a field we will come to agree\nthat tests for bias are never accurate enough, and we will recommend people to\njust look at the distribution of p-values without performing a test. Alternatively,\nwe might believe that it is useful to have a testing procedure that too often\nsuggests a literature contains at least some non-zero effects, because we feel\nwe need some way to intersubjectively point out that there is bias in a\nliterature, even if this is based on an imperfect test. Such discussions\nrequire a wide range of stakeholders, and the opinion of statisticians about\nthe statistical properties of a test is only one source of input in this\ndiscussion. Imperfect procedures are implemented all the time, if they are the\nbest we have, and doing nothing is also not working. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Statistical\nmethods are rarely perfect from their inception, and all have limitations. Although\nI understand the feeling, banning all tests that have not been adequately vetted\nby an expert is inherently unscientific. Such a suggestion would destroy the\nvery core of science \u2013 an institution that promotes mutual criticism, while\naccepting our fallibility.

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "content": "Objective. Emotional states and mood disorders are closely interconnected, and their joint recognition serves as a critical pathway to uncovering their intrinsic relationship. Currently, deep learning (DL) models based on electroencephalogram (EEG) have achieved significant progress in single tasks such as emotion recognition or mood disorder (MD) recognition. However, most existing models are limited to handling only one of these tasks independently and fail to effectively leverage the shared features in EEG data related to both emotions and mood disorders. This limitation hinders the in-depth exploration of the complex interplay between emotions and mood disorders. Therefore, this study aims to develop an EEG-based DL framework for the joint recognition of emotions and mood disorders, thereby providing a foundation for further investigation into their interaction. Approach. We design a multi-gate mixture-of-experts graph convolutional network model(MMoGCN) for joint emotion and MD recognition. MMoGCN comprises three key modules: (1) a feature extraction module based on differential entropy to robustly represent EEG signals; (2) a Multi-gated shared experts module, which integrates two experts, and combines them through a gating mechanism to extract shared representations across tasks; and (3) adaptive task-specific towers, which consist of individual classification towers for each task and incorporate an adaptive weighting loss function to dynamically adjust task contributions. MMoGCN is evaluated on a self-collected dataset and further validated on the public DEAP dataset. Main results. MMoGCN achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines in both emotion and MD recognition. Validation experiments on DEAP further demonstrate the scalability and generalization of MMoGCN. Significance. An effective multi-task learning model is proposed for joint emotion and MD recognition based on EEG. Additionally, the cognitive differences are also analyzed in emotional responses between healthy controls and subjects with mood disorders, providing methodological insights and potential assistance for cognitive rehabilitation from both cognitive and emotional perspectives.",

However, existing DL training strategies typically focus on either frequency or phase information alone, thus failing to fully exploit these dual inherent properties and substantially limiting classification accuracy. Approach. To tackle this limitation, this study proposes a joint frequency-phase training strategy (JFPTS), which comprises two complementary stages with distinct time-window sampling schemes. The first stage adopts a frequency prior-driven sampling scheme to improve frequency component utilization, whereas the second stage employs a phase-locked sampling scheme to enhance intra-category phase consistency. This design enables JFPTS to effectively leverage both frequency and phase properties of SSVEP signals. Main results. Comprehensive experiments on two well-established public datasets validate the effectiveness of JFPTS. The results demonstrate that the JFPTS-enhanced model achieves a marked superiority over the current state-of-the-art classification approaches, notably surpassing the long-standing performance benchmark set by task-discriminative component analysis (TDCA). Significance. Overall, JFPTS establishes a new training paradigm that advances DL approaches for SSVEP classification and promotes the broader adoption of SSVEP-BCIs.",

    "content": "Objective. Myoelectric control systems translate electromyographic (EMG) signals into control commands, enabling immersive human\u2013robot interactions in the real world and the Metaverse. The variability of EMG due to various confounding factors leads to significant performance degradation. Such variability can be mitigated by training a highly generalizable but massively parameterized deep neural network, which can be effectively scaled using a vast dataset. We aim to find an alternative simple, explainable, efficient and parallelizable model, which can flexibly scale up with a larger dataset and scale down to reduce model size, and thereby will significantly facilitate the practical implementation of myoelectric control. Approach. In this work, we discuss the scalability of a random forest (RF) for myoelectric control. We show how to scale an RF up and down during the process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and automatic self-calibration. The effects of diverse factors such as bootstrapping, decision tree editing (pre-training, pruning, grafting, appending), and the size of training data are systematically studied using EMG data from 106 participants including both low- and high-density electrodes. Main results. We examined several factors that affect the size and accuracy of the model. The best solution could reduce the size of RF models by 500\u00d7, with the accuracy reduced by only 1.5%. Importantly, for the first time we report the merit of RF that with more EMG electrodes (higher input dimension), the RF model size would be reduced. Significance. All of these findings contribute to the real time deployment RF models in real world myoelectric control applications.",

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "Motor implementation of control and reward-based urgency regulation across impulsivity",
    "content": "Everyday decisions unfold dynamically, with commitment shaped by a growing sense of urgency that can, when excessive, contribute to impulsive choices. Here we aimed at dissociating two modes of urgency regulation, control-driven (accuracy-oriented) and reward-driven (motivation-based), and asked whether their relative influence varies across individuals differing in impulsivity. We further investigated how these regulatory modes are implemented in the motor system, focusing on two modulatory effects: surround inhibition and broad modulation. Healthy participants, whose impulsivity was assessed with the UPPS urgency dimension, performed a modified Tokens task crossing control demands (low vs high control blocks) with motivational context (low vs high reward trials). In two separate sessions, single-pulse TMS was applied either over the hand motor representation to probe corticospinal excitability indexing surround inhibition, or over the leg representation to index broad modulations of motor activity. This design successfully dissociated the two regulatory modes: control-driven adjustments (across blocks) were most evident in less impulsive participants, whereas reward-driven adjustments (across trials) were most evident in more impulsive participants. Consistent with this dissociation, control-driven urgency regulation was associated with broad modulation of motor activity, whereas reward-driven urgency adjustments were associated with changes in surround inhibition. These motor signatures may serve as probes of the respective contributions of control- and reward-driven regulation even when they are not explicitly dissociated. Our findings suggest that impulsivity may not simply reflect 'more urgency' but a different weighting of the influences that shape it during decision making, a hypothesis that can now be tested in clinical conditions.",

    "title": "Alpha oscillations are dysrhythmic in Fragile X syndrome",
    "content": "Background: Alpha oscillations are dominant rhythms in the human brain, supporting inhibitory control and coordination of neural activity. Altered alpha dynamics are observed across many neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of autism and intellectual disability. FXS exhibits paradoxical alpha power: elevated absolute but reduced relative power. To resolve this incongruity, we considered that conventional power metrics, relying on averaging, may obscure the underlying critical temporal dynamics of such neural rhythms. Methods: Here, we investigate alpha oscillations in FXS as a model to decompose nonspecific alpha abnormalities into underlying temporal features. We used cycle-by-cycle (bycycle) alpha burst analysis from source-localized resting-state EEG of 70 individuals with FXS and 71 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls. Statistical modeling examined group, sex, and regional differences in alpha burst features using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results: We reveal that alpha bursts in FXS show reduced count only in males, prolonged periods across sexes, and elevated amplitudes, particularly in males. Spatial mapping identified differential circuit vulnerability: timing-associated dysregulation in cognitive-control regions and amplitude elevations in sensory cortices. Within the FXS group, global alpha burst amplitude correlated with hyperactivity symptoms and inversely with general intelligence scores, and burst count correlated with age. Limitations: This study is limited by its resting-state design and cross-sectional nature. Future studies should explore task-based modulation of alpha burst features and longitudinal trajectories in FXS. Additionally, fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) was not quantified for participants, limiting potential stratification by molecular severity. Conclusions: These findings resolve paradoxical alpha power in FXS into features consistent with interneuron dysfunction, demonstrating the potential for burst-level decomposition in mechanistic hypothesis generation and biomarker development across neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "Individual Differences in Dopaminergic Modulation of Exploration-Exploitation Behaviour",
    "content": "Dopamine (DA) has been implicated in exploration-exploitation behaviour, i.e., exploring novel, potentiallybetter options vs. exploiting known, previously rewarding options. Impairments in this trade-off occur inpsychiatric disorders involving DAergic dysfunction, including addiction and schizophrenia. Pharmacologicalstudies revealed a contribution of DA to exploration, but inconsistent findings suggest that interindividualvariability in baseline DA may modulate effects. To address this, we investigated the effects of the DAprecursor L-DOPA on exploration-exploitation during reinforcement learning in a sample of N = 75 healthyparticipants (n = 32 women), following a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pre-registered design(https://osf.io/p2r7u). We assessed whether putative baseline DA markers, including spontaneouseye blink rate, working memory (WM) capacity, and impulsivity, modulated drug effects and probed visualfixation patterns and pupil dilation as markers of exploration. L-DOPA had no overall effect on computationalmodel parameters of random exploration, directed exploration or choice perseveration. WM capacitymoderated drug effects on random exploration, with stronger effects at higher WM capacity. Remaining DAproxies showed no credible effects. Pooling the data from male participants with that from an earlier male-only study (Chakroun et al., 2020; total N = 74), L-DOPA increased uncertainty-dependent value weightingand perseveration strength, while decreasing habit updating, indicating a stronger tendency to repeatprevious choices and slower decay of their influence over time. No credible drug effects were observed infemale participants. Pupil dilation was tonically increased under L-DOPA and scaled with explorationbehaviour and prediction error, confirming that pupillometry can index exploration-exploitation dynamics.Visual exploration patterns reflected uncertainty-driven sampling, but were unaffected by L-DOPA. Takentogether, results suggest that DAergic modulation of exploration and perseveration behaviour may becontingent on cognitive capacity and sex, rather than exerting uniform effects across individuals.",

    "title": "Counting apples - How does the prefrontal region support early numerical understanding in preschool children?",
    "content": "Because early maths skills strongly predict later outcomes, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that shape early learning in children. The recent years have seen an increase in studying the neural correlates that support the acquisition of maths skills. However, existing work in early childhood has primarily focused on core number-processing regions in the parietal regions, with comparatively little attention to the supportive role of prefrontal regions. In this study, we examined the engagement of the prefrontal regions when matching numbers and objects. Children (N=60, 25 girls, aged 2.74-5.18 years) matched auditory small (1-3) and large (5-7) numbers, as well as objects (fruits) to corresponding visual pictures while their frontoparietal brain responses were recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Importantly, matching large numbers was substantially more difficult than matching small numbers or objects. The analysis revealed that children had increased activation in the right middle frontal gyrus when matching large numbers, compared to small numbers. However, there was no difference in the prefrontal region between matching small numbers and objects. The connectivity analysis further revealed increased frontoparietal connectivity when matching small numbers, but not large numbers or objects. Our findings suggest that prefrontal involvement during early numerical knowledge acquisition relies primarily on domain-general mechanisms, with number-specific responses likely to emerge later in development.",

    "content": "Sex differences in brain connectivity are well documented, yet how these differences evolve across the human lifespan remains poorly understood. Rigorously assessing sex-dependent trajectories of brain network organization is challenging due to difficulty in acquiring, processing, and modeling high-dimensional connectomes. Here, we analyzed 15 types of functional and structural connectivity networks from 1286 healthy individuals aged 8-100+ years, using our new AI-based Krakencoder to derive a low-dimensional multimodal \"fusion\" connectome representation. Sex differences were minimal in early childhood, pronounced in young to mid-adulthood, and diverged across modalities in later life: functional connectivity grew less distinct and structural connectivity grew more distinct from midlife onward. Functional differences were driven predominantly by higher-order association networks (default mode, control), while structural differences concentrated in lower-order cerebellar and subcortical pathways. These findings provide a lifespan-wide, multimodal map of sex differences in brain networks which may help inform sex-specific vulnerability and resilience to brain disorders.",

    "content": "Atypical motion processing has been reported in multiple developmental conditions, including autism and dyslexia, and taken as support for a general developmental vulnerability in the dorsal stream. Yet by uncovering dynamically unfolding processes, electroencephalography can determine the extent to which motion processing signatures are shared or distinct across different developmental conditions. Here we used pre-registered topographical analyses across the whole high-density electrode array to determine, for the first time, whether autistic and dyslexic children activate the same or distinct brain pathways as typically developing children, when completing two motion processing tasks. Participants were 29 autistic, 44 dyslexic and 57 typically developing children aged 6 to 14 years. Group differences in overall brain response strength were found in both tasks. Topographical activity differed in both autistic and dyslexic children compared to typically developing children (but not between autistic and dyslexic children) in a motion coherence task between 456 - 560 ms. However, group differences in a direction integration task (with no incoherent motion) depended on stimulus difficulty and time window (434 - 500 ms and 538 - 638 ms), with different patterns of divergence from typical development in autism and dyslexia. These results suggest that there are differences in the brain networks used to accomplish motion processing tasks in both autistic and dyslexic children, and demonstrate the utility of a topographical approach for detecting group differences in neural mechanisms, which can be missed by univariate approaches.",

    "content": "Speech production depends on the precise temporal integration of articulatory movements with phonation. While ventral primary motor cortex is known to encode articulatory features, how phonatory timing, and its coordination with articulation, is represented across cortical and cerebellar circuits remains poorly understood. Using 7T functional MRI, we examined neural representations during overt syllable production varying in place of articulation and voice onset time. Multivariate analyses revealed reliable, syllable-specific differences in activity patterns across both cortical and cerebellar speech regions. Ventral primary sensorimotor cortex distinguished syllables by place of articulation, whereas dorsal sensorimotor cortex was more sensitive to the timing of voice onset relative to articulation. Secondary sensorimotor speech areas, including the operculum and auditory cortex, showed a hybrid representational profile, integrating both articulatory and phonatory features. In the cerebellum, representational geometry was dominated by the place of articulation; however, overall syllable representations were most similar to those in the operculum, accounting for unique variance beyond that explained by ventral sensorimotor cortex. Together, these findings reveal feature-specific representational tuning across primary sensorimotor regions during speech production. The selective representational alignment between operculum and cerebellum may support the refinement of speech motor plans prior to execution.",

The vocalization models robustly distinguished children with and without language delay (ROC-AUC 0.90), beyond the acoustic properties of the recordings (ROC-AUC: 0.62), and outperformed similar models analyzing metadata that literature reports as predictive factor for early language development (ROC-AUC: < 0.69 [95% CI: 0.08 - 0.15 to 0.48 - 0.73], P < 0.001]). This indicates that neural networks applied to foundational model audio vectorizations can extract meaningful developmental markers from brief samples of immature speech, to classify speech status, offering a promising, scalable approach for language abilities early screening.",

To address this issue, we combined a dopaminergic challenge (mazindol, a dopamine transporter [DAT] reuptake inhibitor), PET, resting-state fMRI, and hidden Markov modeling (HMM) to characterize time-varying alterations in human large-scale functional networks following acute DAT blockade. We found that mazindol-induced increases in endogenous dopamine altered the balance between the brain's functional \"metastates,\" two recurrent higher-order network configurations that each encompass multiple HMM-derived brain states. Mazindol increased the time participants spent in an internally oriented cognitive metastate and decreased the time spent in a sensorimotor-perceptual metastate, with the DMN showing the most pronounced lengthening. In exploratory analyses, declines in [11C]raclopride binding, a PET index of D2 dopamine receptor availability reflecting increased striatal extracellular dopamine levels, tended to show a positive correlation with the prolongation of these cognitive states. These findings indicate that dopamine is closely linked to shifts from sensorimotor and perceptual to cognitive brain metastates, potentially underpinning the prioritization of internally oriented over externally driven psychological processes. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic, time-resolved connectivity approaches for understanding neuromodulatory actions in the human brain and suggest that dopamine helps regulate the dynamic balance between functionally competing large-scale brain networks.",

    "title": "Oscillatory and aperiodic neural dynamics shape temporal perception and weighting of perceptual priors in ADHD profiles",
    "content": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by an atypically compressed sense of time, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this atypical temporal perception remain poorly understood. Temporal perception depends on the brain's ability to organize sensory input into coherent experiences, ensuring perceptual stability despite uncertainty. Oscillations in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and aperiodic 1/f dynamics have been proposed as key neural mechanisms through which the visual system orchestrates sensory information over time. Individuals with ADHD show atypicalities in these neural dynamics, but how these features relate to ADHD differences in temporal processing remains unexplored. Here, we combined a sustained visual temporal integration task with resting-state EEG to test whether oscillatory and aperiodic neural dynamics jointly account for temporal processing performance across neurotypical participants with self-reported ADHD traits (n = 83). Higher ADHD features in both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive domains were associated with narrower temporal binding windows and reduced serial dependence on prior perception, indicating sharper temporal resolution but diminished perceptual stability. Resting-state EEG revealed systematically faster individual alpha frequency (IAF) and flatter aperiodic spectra in individuals with higher ADHD traits. Mediation analyses showed that faster IAF explained ADHD-related reductions in temporal integration thresholds and serial dependence, whereas increased neural noise selectively amplified perceptual history-dependent biases. These findings reveal distinct oscillatory and aperiodic neural pathways through which ADHD features shape temporal perception, suggesting a multidimensional neural architecture underlying atypical temporal processing in ADHD.",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "title": "The effects of electrical stimulation on neurons and glia of the central nervous system",
    "content": "Objective. This review paper focuses on how both direct current (DC) stimulation and alternating current (AC) stimulation affects the central nervous system\u2019s (CNSs) cells and its potential as a neurotherapeutic. Furthermore, addressing the promise of combinatorial approaches that utilize other treatments alongside electrical stimulation (ES) and how ES has shaped clinical approaches as a new rehabilitation treatment. Approach. Authors conducted this review to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation; 124 manuscripts were identified through Google Scholar for insights into ES effects on neurons and glia in both in vitro and in vivo models. Main results. The review summarizes findings from DC and AC stimulation paradigms applied to in vitro or in vivo preclinical models and summarizes the promise of ES when applied clinically. Generally, DC stimulation promotes axonal extension towards the cathode, while axons retract at the anode, limiting regeneration. AC stimulation alternates electrode polarity, enabling axonal extension in both directions. The intensity and duration of ES significantly affects the extent of neurite outgrowth. For astrocytes and microglia, ES\u2014whether AC or DC\u2014downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting A2 or M2 reactive states conducive to regeneration, respectively. Regarding oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), both DC and AC stimulation enhance OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes, increasing myelin content and supporting axonal myelination. ES, when combined with stem cell treatments, drug delivery approaches, or with electroactive biomaterials, facilitate greater efficacy of these approaches. Clinically, short-single sessions of ES have shown long-term improvement. More specifically, preliminary efforts have been implemented to restore gait, hand tremors, and speech in spinal cord injuries, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and stroke patients, respectively. Significance. ES is an evolving neurotherapeutic strategy for CNS related disease or injuries. Understanding how ES modulates neurons and glia is critical for optimizing its application in the clinic.",

    "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
    "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

    "title": "Extinction and reinstatement sex-dependently affect freezing behavior, pain perception, locomotion, and rearing behavior in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
    "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

    "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

    "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

    "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

The idea is that it will do some chemical synthesis and be in operation roughly 70-80% of the time (apart from the chiller, the other equipment will not actually do things most of the time, as they wait for reactions to happen). It would run a pre-determined program set by the user which lasts anything from 2-72 hours, during which it would pump reagents to different places, change temperature etc. I have seen equipment like this run of LabView/similar, PLC but not so many on Python. </p> <p>Could python be a reliable approach to control this? It would save us so much money and time (easier programming than PLC).</p> <p>Note: All these parts have RS232/RS485 ports and some already have python driver in GitHub.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/deduhej_\"> /u/deduhej_ </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qrguk2/is_it_reliable_to_run_lab_equipment_on_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qrguk2/is_it_reliable_to_run_lab_equipment_on_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "An integrated virtual reality platform for naturalistic neuroimaging with magnetoencephalography",
    "content": "Studying the brain in motion promises deep insights into the neural circuits that support complex, real-world behaviour. In humans, wearable optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) enable magnetoencephalography (MEG) with millisecond temporal resolution and millimetre spatial precision during movement. Integrating this technology with virtual reality (VR) could enable fully naturalistic experimental paradigms, but magnetic interference from existing head-mounted displays (HMDs) prevents reliable whole-brain MEG recordings. Here, we present and validate a VR system that integrates with wearable, OPM-based MEG. At its core is a purpose-designed HMD with minimal ferromagnetic material, resulting in magnetic flux density two orders of magnitude lower than consumer-grade alternatives at comparable resolution and weight. Using phantom measurements and established perceptual and cognitive benchmark tasks across participants, we demonstrate robust stimulus-induced neuronal activity at both sensor and source level. Crucially, these sources span the entire brain, including visual, motor and prefrontal cortices, as well as hippocampus. Our proposed VR system is straightforward to produce, readily extendable, and enables whole-brain MEG during immersive, naturalistic behaviours.",

    "title": "Avatar facial expressions enhance social presence and inter-brain synchronization in virtual reality",
    "content": "Virtual reality (VR) has become a prominent medium for computer-mediated social interaction, yet the psychological and neural mechanisms underpinning avatar-mediated communication remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated how dynamically modulated avatar facial expressions shape interpersonal interaction in VR. Pairs of participants engaged in a collaborative creativity task while interacting via avatars whose facial expressions were either amplified, natural, or expressionless. We collected subjective measures of body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction, while simultaneously recording neural activity using functional near-infrared-spectroscopy-based hyperscanning to assess inter-brain synchrony (IBS). Avatars displaying facial expressions, particularly amplified ones, significantly enhanced body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction compared to expressionless avatars. At the neural level, visible avatar facial expressions were associated with IBS in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), regions that are commonly implicated in social-cognitive processes such as mentalizing and executive control. Although task performance did not differ across conditions, social presence was positively correlated with creative performance, suggesting that psychological connectedness supports collaborative creativity. Together, these findings indicate that avatar facial expressivity functions as a critical nonverbal social cue that facilitates affective and cognitive alignment between interaction partners. By linking subjective experience with inter-brain neural dynamics, this study provides empirical guidance for the design of virtual environments that promote social engagement and effective collaboration.",

    "title": "The schizophrenia associated protein DISC1 is a multivalent tetrameric hub of conserved ancient fold",
    "content": "DISC1 is a pleiotropic protein with essential roles in neuronal proliferation and migration, intracellular signalling and cargo transport. It associates with a diverse array of partner molecules in these contexts. Mutations at the DISC1 locus are strongly associated with a spectrum of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Despite its clinical relevance, the molecular architecture and function of DISC1 have remained largely elusive. We present a cryo-EM structure of the entire conserved core region of DISC1. The structure reveals an intricate homotetrameric assembly that harbours conserved bacteria-derived UVR domains. Four of these domains, one from each monomer, mediate extensive contacts forming two asymmetric dimer units. The dimers in turn interface with each other at two distinct coiled coil domains to achieve a two-fold symmetric tetramer. Mutational analysis shows that this tetrameric architecture enables DISC1 to simultaneously bind multiple copies of NDE1 client protein. Importantly, tetramerization and partner binding are structurally independent functions of DISC1. Altogether, our study provides a compelling molecular model of an ancient bacteria protein fold participating in the assembly of a multivalent mammalian scaffold hub that can coordinate multiple partner molecules.",

    "title": "High-fidelity backpropagation through primate foveal cones",
    "content": "Primate vision has exceptionally high spatial acuity and contrast sensitivity. This performance originates in specialized photoreceptors of the fovea. These cones transduce light into electrical signals in the outer segment, and convey these signals to the presynaptic terminal for transmission. Backpropagating signals are also possible, as the terminal receives gap-junctional input from neighboring cones. Such signals could influence phototransduction itself. To test this idea, we recorded electrophysiologically from both ends of single cones dissociated from the macaque fovea. We found that backpropagation was effective despite the extreme slenderness and length of these cells. Backpropagation was also effective in a passive compartmental model, indicating that amplification by voltage-gated channels is not required. We then modeled mosaics of foveal cones coupled by terminal gap junctions. Despite faithful backpropagation of these inputs, they appear unlikely to influence phototransduction. Thus, even though foveal cones exhibit effective backpropagation, their encoding of visual information remains compartmentalized.",

    "title": "Higher-order intrinsic routes support flexible task-evoked communication",
    "content": "Flexible task-evoked communication requires the brain to transiently establish functional interactions that are not evident during rest, yet the network mechanisms supporting these newly formed connections remain unresolved. Using whole-brain functional MRI from 92 participants performing six cognitive tasks, we show that task-evoked communication is implemented within a constrained intrinsic network architecture rather than through large-scale rewiring. Across tasks, we found that approximately 70% of functional connections were preserved from rest, forming a dominant stable core, while task engagement selectively reconfigured a smaller subset of connections, primarily at the between-network level. While existing activity-flow models explain task-evoked information transfer primarily through direct stable core connections, we demonstrate that newly formed connections between regions lacking direct resting-state coupling were supported by selectively strengthened indirect higher-order resting-state routes embedded within the intrinsic scaffold. Network-level analyses revealed a multiscale organization of information transfer: we observed that direct stable routes dominated within-network communication, most prominently in sensory-motor and default mode systems, whereas indirect higher-order routes preferentially supported between-network integration through control and attentional systems. By extending activity-flow modelling to incorporate these higher-order intrinsic routes, we show a significant improvement in the prediction of task-evoked activity at the global, between-network scale, confirming their functional recruitment during task performance. Together, our findings identify higher-order intrinsic routes as a key mechanism enabling flexible task-evoked communication within a stable large-scale network architecture.",

    "title": "From Sensory Details to Verbal Codes: Visual Memory Reinstatement of Location and Color Features",
    "content": "Successful episodic memory depends on the reinstatement of encoding content and processes during retrieval. However, it remains unclear how such reinstatement (1) differs for various perceptual features, (2) supports subjective versus objective memory retrieval, and (3) relies on linguistic information. To investigate these three issues, we designed an fMRI study in which participants encoded and recalled the colors and spatial locations of object pictures, and provided subjective vividness and objective precision measures. We used encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) to identify feature-level reinstatement for location or color features, and trial-specific reinstatement for individual location trials or individual color trials. The study yielded three main findings. First, feature-level reinstatement in frontoparietal and visual regions supported both location and color memory, whereas trial-specific reinstatement in early visual cortex contributed to location memory and feature-level reinstatement in lateral/anterior temporal cortices, to color memory. Second, trial-specific reinstatement in early visual cortex supported both location vividness and precision, while feature-level reinstatement in inferior frontal gyrus contributed to color vividness, and trial-specific reinstatement in posterior inferior temporal gyrus (including the color area), to color precision. Finally, color name richness (the number of names associated with a particular color) enhanced color memory precision and modulated trial-specific color reinstatement in right anterior inferior temporal gyrus. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual and linguistic reinstatement play complementary roles in visual episodic memory: perceptual replay provides fine-grained sensory details, whereas linguistic replay can scaffold and refine these representations, especially for features that are easier to verbalize such as colors.",

    "title": "White Matter Lesion Asymmetry and Carotid Intraplaque Hemorrhage: A Novel Imaging Phenotype for Stroke Risk in Older Men",
    "content": "Background: While identifying high-risk carotid disease remains a significant clinical challenge, the specific role of carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) is poorly understood. Although IPH has been linked to white matter lesion (WML) burden, current assessments overlook the directional impact of plaque instability on the brain. This study sought to determine whether IPH is an independent driver of asymmetric WML pathology and evaluate if this phenotype can identify a high-risk demographic for TIA and stroke. Methods: This multi-center retrospective study analyzed 264 participants (mean age 71.8 years) from the Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (2010-2015). Participants underwent 3T MRI to assess carotid IPH and WMLs. We quantified WMLs using a deep-learning pipeline to extract three biomarkers: volume (WML-ICV), intensity (WML-Intensity), and intensity ratio (WML-IR). The Asymmetry Index Measure (AIM) defined the inter-hemispheric log-ratio, while the association between IPH and AIM was examined using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, stenosis, and scanner manufacturer. A secondary composite outcome of TIA/stroke was analyzed via logistic regression to evaluate the interaction between IPH, age, and sex. Results: While whole-brain WML burden did not significantly differ by IPH status (p > 0.60), IPH status was a robust independent predictor of hemispheric asymmetry (WML-ICV: p = 0.01; WML-Intensity, p = 0.01). Post-hoc analysis confirmed WML burden was significantly higher in IPH+ older males (=> 70 years) compared to younger cohorts (p < 0.04). This older male subgroup also demonstrated 4.57-fold higher adjusted odds of TIA/stroke (p = 0.02) compared to other demographic subgroups (all p > 0.87). Conclusions: Carotid IPH is independently associated with a rightward asymmetric WML phenotype not captured by global metrics. This imaging marker identifies a high-risk demographic of older males with a nearly five-fold increase in clinical events, suggesting that hemispheric-level analysis provides critical prognostic value for stroke risk stratification.",

    "title": "Single cell profiling reveals GSM-15606 attenuates air pollution-induced inflammation and preserves hippocampal neurogenesis",
    "content": "Introduction: Air pollution (AirPoll) is a major environmental risk factor for age-related cognitive decline and dementia, yet we poorly understood the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its effects and their potential attenuation. Methods: We combined single cell RNA sequencing with immunohistochemistry to determine transcriptional responses in microglia, astrocytes, neurons and neural stem cells in the hippocampus of mice following exposure to chronic diesel exhaust particle (DEP). Differential gene expression profiles were compared between filtered-air and DEP exposed animals. The gamma secretase modulator GSM-15606 (BPN) was used to probe selective rescue of inflammatory signatures across distinct cell populations. Results: DEP exposure triggered robust inflammatory programs in microglia and astrocytes, including upregulation of cytokine signaling components, innate immune receptors, stress-responsive transcription factors, and markers of reactive glial phenotypes. In neural stem cells, DEP induced activation of gliosis-associated pathways, including Il6st, Stat3, and Txnip, consistent with a pro-inflammatory state that may bias lineage decisions. Immunostaining confirmed a significant reduction in immature neurons in the neurogenic niche after AirPoll exposure. GSM-15606 attenuated many DEP-induced transcriptional alterations in microglia and astrocytes, reducing expression of inflammatory mediators and reactive gliosis markers, but did not modulate the inflammatory profile of neural stem cells. Conclusions: AirPoll activates divergent inflammatory pathways across hippocampal cell populations and suppresses neurogenesis. Targeting inflammation with GSM-15606 selectively reverses glial but not neural stem cell responses, highlighting cell-type-specific mechanisms and potential therapeutic pathways to mitigate pollution-related cognitive vulnerability. These results support GSM-15606 as a protective agent against AirPoll-induced hippocampal dysfunction and amyloidogenic stress.",

    "title": "Compression Detects Changes in Spiking Neural Data from Cortical Lesions",
    "content": "Objective: The complexity of neural data changes as the brain processes information during events. Universal lossless compression algorithms, which are broadly applicable and grounded in information theory, identify and exploit redundancies in data in order to compress it to essentially-optimal sizes regardless of underlying statistics. These algorithms may be used to conveniently and efficiently estimate a given signal's Shannon entropy rate, a biologically relevant measure of the complexity of a signal. It is therefore natural to explore their effectiveness in the analysis of spiking neural data. Approach: This work focuses on using compression to analyze recordings (96-channel Utah arrays) taken from motor cortex of animals performing reaching tasks for three days before and three days after administering electrolytic lesions (Subject U: 4 lesions, H: 3). In particular, we use the inverse compression ratio (ICR), which compares the sizes of compressed and uncompressed data to estimate the amount of statistically unique information. We calculate ICR with temporally-independent lossless compression (gzip) and temporally-dependent lossy compression (H.264, MPEG-2). Compression-based ICR was compared to single-neuron measures used to understand spiking data, such as average firing rates and Fano factor. Compression is also compared to common dimensionality reduction techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). Main Results: Statistical tests on aggregate data comparing each metric before and after lesioning reveal that ICR is able to significantly (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.01) detect lesions with higher accuracy than single-neuron metrics, but not dimensionality reduction (ICR methods: 85.7%, single-neuron methods: 78.6%, dimensionality reduction: 100%). Additionally, statistical results on the same data show that ICR metrics remain more stable than single-neuron methods after lesion. The bitrate parameter of lossy compression algorithms is swept to better understand the effect of information rates and \"optimal\" compression on lesion detection performance. Our conclusions are confirmed by the same analyses performed on several different simulated neural datasets. Significance: These results suggest that compression algorithms may be a useful tool to detect and better understand perturbations to the underlying structure of neural data. Information-theoretic analyses may complement techniques like dimensionality reduction and firing rate tuning as a convenient and useful tool to characterize neural data.",

    "content": "One ubiquitous feature of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly switch between multiple tasks. Abstract task representations provide a basis for task learning, switching, and generalization, yet how the brain coordinates multiple task representations to support multitasking and task-switching remains poorly understood. We recorded functional MRI activity in human participants while they concurrently held multiple task rules in working memory and prioritized different rules for stimulus processing across trials. Our results reveal two distinct coding schemes for task prioritization. First, an active coding scheme supports the spatial separation of prioritized and unprioritized task rules: prioritized rules are represented across a distributed cortical network, whereas unprioritized rules are only found in the posterior cortex. Second, besides this active scheme, subregions of the default mode network, including the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, contribute to offloading task representations into an unprioritized state and subsequently maintain sustained representations of these rules across trials via latent neural codes. Behavioral predictions using on-task, trial-wise and sustained, block-wise representations further support the neural dissociation. These findings unveil a dual neural system with distinct coding schemes that jointly enable cognitive flexibility for task implementation and switching.",

    "title": "Loss of Fmr1 reorganizes the multi-elemental composition of neural and somatic tissues in Fragile X mice",
    "content": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and results from a genetic mutation which silences the expression of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP serves various roles regulating cellular protein synthesis and ion flux. However, a comprehensive comparison of multidimensional elemental balance (i.e., ionome) between FXS genotypes and tissues remains absent from the literature. Here, we measured the multivariate balance of 10 elements (i.e., ionome) in tissues of wild-type and Fmr1-knockout mice to compare ionomic composition of brain and somatic tissues within and across genotypes. We found that homogenized brain tissue including several regions (brain PMHTH; define at first use) differed in elemental balance between genotypes, according to MANOVA. We failed to observe differences between genotypes in the mean ratio of any individual element in PMHTH, but sodium displayed lower variance in knockout than wild-type PMHTH. Knockout striatum displayed lower variance in potassium than wild-type. Knockout olfactory bulbs contained higher mean iron and displayed higher variance in sodium and copper than wild-type. Wild-type feces contained higher mean magnesium and zinc than knockout. These results align with previous work showing FXS pathologies alter electrolytic and metal ion regulation, neuronal excitability, and gastrointestinal function. Further work is needed to identify the source of overall ionomic differences in heterogeneous brain tissue (PMHTH), which could be due to differences among regions. Future work should additionally test how elemental differences relate to function at the cellular level, as well as patterns of individual intake, digestion, assimilation, and/or excretion.",

    "title": "D-Methionine Improves Spatial Navigation and Attenuates Oxidative Stress and Amyloid Pathology in a Sex-Specific Manner",
    "content": "Background Oxidative stress and maladaptive neuroimmune activation contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and represent therapeutic targets beyond amyloid-centered approaches. Objective To determine whether oral D-methionine (D-Met), a redox-active amino acid, reduces amyloid pathology and lipid peroxidation and confers disease-modifying benefits in AD mouse models. Methods Male and female APP/PS1 and APPNL-F mice with advanced AD pathology received oral D-Met or vehicle. Behavioral assessments included locomotor activity and hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory. Amyloid burden, lipid peroxidation, peripheral metabolic and inflammatory markers, and hippocampal microglial phenotypes were evaluated using biochemical and histological analyses. Results D-Met did not alter locomotor or exploratory behavior but improved spatial memory recall in both sexes of APP/PS1 mice and in female APPNL-F mice. APPNL-F males exhibited improved learning during Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition. Amyloid pathology was modestly and region-specifically reduced, including decreased hippocampal plaque size in male APPNL-F mice, reduced cortical plaque size in female APP/PS1 mice, and lower soluble amyloid-{beta} (A{beta})42 in male APP/PS1 mice. Lipid peroxidation, assessed by malondialdehyde, was reduced only in female APPNL-F mice. D-Met induced pronounced sex-dependent peripheral effects, increasing adiposity and pro-inflammatory adipose signaling in males, while reducing perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) IL-6 expression in female APPNL-F mice. In the hippocampus, D-Met remodeled microglial signatures, with female APPNL-F mice showing reduced Iba1 and disease-associated microglial (DAM) markers and increased Axl expression. Conclusion Short-term D-Met acts as a metabolic and redox modulator with modest amyloid-lowering effects mediated by improved microglial function. Therapeutic efficacy is strongly sex- and model-dependent, with the greatest benefit observed in female APPNL-F mice.",

    "title": "Perceptual and neural biomarkers of distraction from an external sound source are not associated with tinnitus severity",
    "content": "Individuals with chronic tinnitus perceive a phantom sound that imposes either a bothersome and irrepressible distraction throughout waking hours or a relatively mild nuisance that often fades into subliminal awareness. The difference in tinnitus salience may reflect a general difference in inhibitory control over any distracting sound, whether externally or internally generated. To test this hypothesis, we investigated neural and behavioral signatures of external auditory distraction suppression in participants with chronic tinnitus that had mild or bothersome tinnitus but were otherwise matched for age and hearing loss. Participants in both groups underwent behavioral and EEG testing that asked them to report on a target stream of amplitude modulated tones that switched from a random arrangement to a repeating sequence. Using additional sounds that imposed varying levels of distraction, we documented neural and perceptual suppression of auditory distractors. Behaviorally, participants with mild versus bothersome tinnitus showed comparable reductions in accuracy in the presence of varying distractor loads. Neural synchronization to the target stimulus change rate provided a useful proxy for distraction effects but did not differ between tinnitus groups. Likewise, no group differences were observed in the neural synchronization to modulation rates of the target or distractor stimuli. Our results build on work showing that individuals with tinnitus perform as well as individuals with normal hearing on listening tasks in noisy environments and expand this observation into the neural representation of sounds. Suppression of the internally generated phantom percept does not appear to be linked to general deficits in suppressing distractors.",

(explicit ratings vs completion events vs doc-based write-back)<p>What I\u2019m asking from you:<p>1.Where does your \u201csecond brain\u201d break down the most?<p>capture / organization / retrieval / execution\n(If you can, share a concrete recent example.)<p>2.What best represents \u201cactive project context\u201d for you today?<p><pre><code>  task project (Todoist/Things/Reminders)\n\n  issues/boards (GitHub/Linear/Jira)\n\n  a doc/wiki page (Notion/Docs)\n\n  calendar\n\n  \"in my head\"\n</code></pre>\nWhich one would you actually allow a tool to read?<p>3.What\u2019s your hard \u201cno\u201d for an AI that suggests actions from your notes/links? (pick 1\u20132)<p><pre><code>  privacy/data retention\n\n  noisy suggestions / interruption\n\n  hallucinations / wrong suggestions\n\n  workflow change / migration cost\n\n  pricing\n\n  others</code></pre></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46826277\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46826277</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

    "title": "Working Memory of Multi-Object Scenes in Primate Frontal Cortex",
    "content": "Working memory allows primates to reason about complex scenes, yet how the brain maintains multiple objects in memory simultaneously remains unclear. Competing theories propose that objects are stored in discrete slots, represented dynamically through switching, or encoded by weighted combinations of single-object representations. We formalized these hypotheses in terms of their quantitative predictions at the level of single neurons and tested them against densely recorded neural data from the dorsomedial frontal cortex and frontal eye field of monkeys trained to perform a novel multi-object working-memory task. Across cross-validated neural data, a Gain model, where population activity reflects weighted compositions of individual object responses, consistently outperformed Slot and Switching models. Trial-specific gain estimates predicted behavioral errors and reaction times, indicating that these latent weights capture meaningful fluctuations in memory fidelity. All results replicated in an independent dataset with different spatial configurations. Together, our work provides a rigorous framework to adjudicate a longstanding debate about how the frontal cortex retains multiple objects, identifying a weighted-sum representation as the format that best explains the neural data.",

    "title": "Dendritic delay lines shape the computation of sound location in neurons of the gerbil medial superior olive",
    "content": "In mammals, neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO) encode information about sounds arising from discrete spatial locations along the horizon. This tuning requires that an internal delay in the brain must offset acoustic disparities to ensure coincident arrival of excitatory inputs driven from the two ears. The source of this internal delay, originally assumed to arise from axonal delay lines, is currently controversial in mammals. Here we use 2-photon guided paired dendritic and somatic recordings together with compartmental modeling of 40 complete MSO neuron morphologies to demonstrate that the dendrites themselves serve as a significant source of internal delay. We show that most MSO neurons exhibit morphological asymmetries that impose different EPSP delays across dendrites and shifts in optimal interaural time differences. Dendrite-based delays in the mammalian MSO are heterogeneous within each isofrequency laminae and provide a stable, structural mechanism to help tune individual neurons to sounds from different azimuthal locations.",

    "title": "mPFC Synaptosome Proteomics Reveals Novel Pathways and Muscarinic Receptor Changes in a Learned Helplessness Mouse Model",
    "content": "Stressful events are a leading factor in development of depression. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is strongly associated with depression etiology and exposure to uncontrollable stressors results in synaptic dysfunction and loss. Learned helplessness is a behavioral paradigm that measures effects of repeated exposure to uncontrollable, inescapable stress on later responses to escapable stress. We therefore performed a proteomic analysis of mPFC synaptosomes in a mouse learned helplessness model to identify molecular changes that could contribute to functional consequences of inescapable stress. Male and female mice were evaluated at baseline and following exposure to escapable or inescapable stress followed by an active avoidance test. Label-free mass spectrometry followed by pathway and protein-protein interaction network analyses identified alterations in signaling pathways involved in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and protein shuttling. Furthermore, phosphoproteomics revealed alterations related to synaptic function, neurotransmitter signaling and protein internalization, as well as changes in activity of kinases previously identified as mediators of antidepressant efficacy (GSK3B) and receptor internalization (ADRBK1). We more deeply examined alterations in the Acetylcholine Receptor Signaling Pathway, and identified muscarinic receptor proteins (Chrm1, Chrm2, Chrm4) and key proteins involved in their translocation to and from the membrane. These results identify substantial changes in the mPFC proteome following exposure to inescapable stressors. In addition, mPFC muscarinic cholinergic signaling is well placed to mediate responses to an inescapable stressor. This proteomic study will be useful in guiding studies of human mPFC relevant to depression. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD073765.",

    "title": "Intrinsic Circadian Organization of the Spinal Cord and Dorsal Root Ganglia",
    "content": "Circadian rhythms coordinate daily fluctuations in physiology and behavior, yet their organization within primary sensory pathways remains poorly defined. Although somatosensory responsiveness varies across the day night cycle, it is unclear whether peripheral sensory circuits possess molecular mechanisms for temporal regulation. Here, we demonstrate that the spinal peripheral sensory axis harbors robust, tissue autonomous circadian clocks. Using real time bioluminescence imaging, we observed sustained oscillations of the core clock protein PER2 in the spinal dorsal horn and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), indicating autonomous circadian timing within these tissues. To define the molecular scope of this regulation, we performed RNA sequencing across a 52 hours circadian time course in DRGs. Circadian analysis identified 626 rhythmic transcripts, representing 3.6% of expressed genes. These genes exhibited non uniform phase distributions and segregated into discrete temporal clusters. Functional annotation revealed phase specific enrichment of biological processes related to transport, neuronal structure, and proteostasis, suggesting coordinated temporal deployment of distinct molecular programs rather than uniform oscillations across the circadian cycle. Cross referencing circadian genes with neuropathic pain associated gene sets revealed limited overlap; however, overlapping genes aligned to specific baseline phase windows enriched for regenerative annotations. Potassium channel related signaling components implicated in neuropathic pain also showed baseline circadian modulation. Together, these findings establish the spinal dorsal horn and DRGs as intrinsically circadian tissues and reveal a temporally structured molecular landscape in primary sensory neurons, providing a framework for understanding how peripheral sensory processing, plasticity, and homeostatic regulation are coordinated across the day night cycle.",

    "title": "Associative emotional memory encoding: Insights from network stability analysis of an fMRI-driven bilinear dynamics",
    "content": "The interplay between emotion and memory is a central topic in cognitive neuroscience, with open questions about the underlying neuronal mechanisms. This article studies dynamic interactions among the hippocampus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex during an fMRI associative memory encoding task. Participants were clustered into three condition groups: Neutral Neutral, Neutral Emotional, or Emotional Emotional, and viewed image pairs associated with their assigned condition. Using the dynamic causal modeling framework, we explore several dynamic models and show that a stochastic bilinear state space model best describes the neuronal dynamics in all conditions. Furthermore, we use graph and control theory techniques to both validate and analyze the model. In particular, we analyze the network dynamics of each condition using tools from graph theory and stability theory and discuss the differences in the strength and direction of connectivity as well as the stability of each of these networks. We confirm the prior finding that memory is enhanced in emotional conditions, in particular in the Neutral Emotional condition. In our work, this enhanced memory is associated with increased hippocampus amygdala coupling and overall network connectivity. In addition, we show that in the Emotional Emotional condition, the coupling of the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as the whole network connectivity increases when the first image valence is substantially less negative rated than the second image. This pattern mirrors the Neutral Emotional condition, where the first image is neutral compared with the second one. Moreover, our model based analyses suggest that the amygdala predominantly influences the other two regions in the Neutral Emotional condition, whereas the OFC plays a dominant role in the other two conditions. Combined data driven modeling, stability analyses, and graph theory tools led to new insights and enhanced the mechanistic understanding of cortical dynamics of emotional associative memory. We discuss these insights, utilize these analytical tools to generalize our findings to some unmeasured conditions, and highlight the potential of these techniques to inform the design of future regulatory mechanisms.",

    "title": "Injury-transduced SerpinOLs modulate neuroinflammation and glial activation in the diseased and non-diseased CNS",
    "content": "Oligodendroglial dysfunction is common in CNS diseases, but the molecular and functional responses of oligodendroglia to CNS pathologies remain poorly defined. Here, we report that oligodendrocytes (OLs) respond to demyelinating diseases by dysregulating serine protease inhibitor clade A member 3N (SERPINA3N). Homeostatic OLs transition to Serpina3n-expressing OLs (SerpinOLs) under other diseased conditions including stroke, endotoxicity, neurodegeneration, neurotrauma, and non-diseased healthy aging conditions. Mechanistically, CNS inflammation or inflammatory mediators is sufficient for SerpinOL transition. Instead, oligodendrocyte injury even in the absence of neuroinflammation or glial activation is sufficient for the transition. Phenotypically, SerpinOLs are characterized by molecular signatures of inflammatory and immune regulation and STAT3 signaling activation. Functionally, SerpinOLs exacerbate neuroinflammation and promote glial activation toward pro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative states. Together, our findings suggest SerpinOLs are a common population of injury-transduced OLs that amplify neuroinflammation and glial activation in the diseased and non-diseased CNS through SERPINA3N secretion. Our findings provide new insights into myelination-independent role of OLs in regulating CNS pathophysiology.",

    "title": "Linear and Nonlinear Oscillatory Functional Brain Networks in Euthymic Bipolar Disorder Classification",
    "content": "Functional brain network (FBN) dysconnectivity has been repeatedly reported in bipolar disorder (BD). However, it remains unclear how this dysconnectivity manifests from the perspective of oscillatory FBNs, that is, which network measures and frequency bands most reliably capture this alteration. Moreover, it is unknown whether this dysconnection is predominantly expressed through linear or nonlinear interactions. Here, we investigated properties of oscillatory FBNs in individuals with euthymic BD. Networks were constructed using linear and nonlinear connectivity measures applied to source-localized resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) current density signals. We then quantified whole-FBN and nodal features using conventional and spectral graph theory methods to characterize disorder-related network mechanisms and evaluate their potential as biomarkers. Significant group differences between BD and control groups were observed in the theta and alpha1 bands. Dynamical whole-FBN alterations were detected primarily in linear oscillatory FBNs, with reduced Shannon entropy and energy in the BD group. These effects were replicated using machine learning, achieving 85% classification accuracy with entropy and energy as the most informative features. In contrast, nodal-level differences emerged mainly in nonlinear FBNs, revealing increased centrality in frontal, and decreased centrality across temporal, and limbic regions. These findings emphasize distinct, frequency-specific roles of linear and nonlinear oscillatory FBNs in BD, with global dysconnectivity reflected in linear FBNs and local alterations captured by nonlinear connectivity. Moreover, network measures related to synchronization stability and complexity more effectively capture BD-related dysconnectivity, suggesting that dynamic features of oscillatory FBNs may serve as potential biomarkers for BD.",

    "title": "Hippocampal Projections to the Striatal Compartments, Striosome and Matrix, are Spatially Segregated in CA1",
    "content": "The hippocampus routes information to the striatum through at least four polysynaptic circuits. Striatal projection neurons are organized into two tissue compartments, the matrix and striosome, which differ in their embryologic origins, relative abundance, intra-striate location, and afferent and efferent connectivity. These compartments are embedded in distinct functional networks and are activated by different tasks. Consequently, hippocampal inputs that route preferentially through the striosome may underpin different functions and engage with different remote networks than inputs that route through the matrix. It was unknown whether striosome-bound and matrix-bound projections from the hippocampus followed different polysynaptic circuits. We assessed hippocampo-striate projections in living humans using probabilistic diffusion tractography by first parcellating the striatum into voxels with striosome-like and matrix-like structural connectivity. We then quantified structural connectivity between hippocampal efferents (CA1) to each set of compartment-like voxels. CA1 projections to striosome-like voxels in the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) were 3.1-fold more abundant than those to matrix-like voxels, particularly in caudo-lateral CA1. This striosome-favoring bias was similar in three segregated hippocampo-striate circuits, in streamlines routing through the subiculum, lateral septum, or medial prefrontal cortex. However, a small region in rostro-medial CA1 preferentially targeted matrix-like voxels. Functional connectivity between CA1 and compartment-like voxels matched this segregated pattern: CA1 activation was correlated with striosome-like voxels but anti-correlated with matrix-like voxels. Additionally, streamlines from CA1 to nucleus accumbens exhibited hemispheric asymmetries, with the left hemisphere biased towards matrix and the right towards striosome. These findings suggest that hippocampo-striate projections are spatially segregated into compartment-specific circuits.",

    "content": "Sensory neuron soma and non-neuronal cells in adult dorsal root ganglia (DRG) derive from multipotent neural crest cells. Satellite glial cells (SGCs), which surround neuronal soma, were suggested to retain developmental potential, but the precise molecular identity of progenitor cells in the adult DRG remains undefined. To address this question, we assembled a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas by integrating over 200,000 DRG and sciatic nerve transcriptomes across multiple studies and injury paradigms. High-resolution clustering resolved 26 cell types and demonstrated significant transcriptional heterogeneity within SGCs and Schwann cells, including repair and reactive sub-states. Crucially, we identified two distinct populations of progenitor cells that reflect different states in the progenitor trajectory. Functionally, progenitor cell numbers significantly increase after injury, and endothelin signaling regulates glial cell proliferation early in development. This integrated DRG and peripheral nerve cell atlas represents an essential resource for exploring new features of the peripheral nervous system.",

    "content": "The laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) is a brainstem hub that integrates sensory and motivational signals to regulate adaptive behavior. While LDT neurons are known to modulate reward and aversion, whether salient stimuli recruit distinct neuronal ensembles within this structure remains unknown. Here, combined cell-type-specific calcium imaging, activity-dependent genetic tagging (TRAP2), and optogenetic reactivation to investigate how rewarding and aversive stimuli recruit and functionally define LDT neurons. Notably, single exposures to cocaine or shock in TRAP2;Ai14 mice labeled spatially and neurochemically distinct ensembles, with minimal overlap. We used fiber photometry and TRAP2 system to tag active neuronal ensembles in the LDT during cocaine (coca-LDT) and foot shock (shock-LDT) exposure, expressing GCaMP8m (green) in these neurons and, simultaneously, sRGECO (red) in the whole LDT. Our results demonstrate coca-LDT activation by physical aversive events and valenced odours, with reduced activity in response to rewarding liquids. Shock-LDT showed activation by physical aversive events, odours, and shock-predictive cues. Additionally, optogenetic reactivation of cocaine-TRAPed ensembles in a two-choice operant task biased action selection toward stimulation-paired responses, whereas shock-TRAPed ensemble activation did not drive avoidance. These findings identify functionally segregated LDT ensembles recruited by opposing motivational stimuli and reveal a causal role for reward-activated brainstem ensembles in shaping behavior. This functional segregation may contribute to the brain's ability to differentiate stimulus types and, to some extent, valence experiences. Our results may provide evidence on how the LDT influences decision-making processes in addiction and anxiety disorders, potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches.",

This transformation unfolds the hippocampus into a planar slab, bounded by the meningeal and ventricular surfaces, with the depth defined along the radial axis. We apply this transform to image volumes, single neuron reconstructions, and point data, including spatial transcriptomic and rabies tracing datasets, revealing topographic variations in the dorsoventral and radial axes that are obscured in the CCF coordinate space. As proof of principle, we use flatmaps to show connectivity loss in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and track postnatal development of microglial distribution in the hippocampus. This work provides an efficient and accessible resource for visualizing hippocampal organization across development and disease, offering new opportunities to interrogate the structure and function of this important brain region.",

    "content": "The microglial CD33 gene is overexpressed in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and multiple CD33 genetic variants are directly linked to disease risk. Here, we investigate CD33 function in induced human microglial cells by increasing or decreasing CD33 levels with AAV6-mediated gene transfer and with CD33-targeting siRNA, respectively. Phagocytosis of oligomeric amyloid beta into live microglia was doubled by reducing CD33 levels, with concomitant increases in secreted TREM2 and in TREM2 activation as assayed by phosphorylation of downstream SYK. Increasing CD33 had opposing effects on microglial activity, decreasing amyloid beta uptake by approximately half, reducing LPS-induced increases in IL-10, and decreasing the efficacy of a TREM2-activating antibody. Experiments combining siRNA and AAV6 demonstrated a linear relationship between CD33 protein and amyloid beta uptake. Results show that CD33 largely governs multiple microglial functions associated with Alzheimer's disease and affects both pharmacological and physiological activation of TREM2.",

    "title": "Unconstrained Plasticity Disrupts Memory Consolidation in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome",
    "content": "Memory impairment is a hallmark cognitive deficit in Rett syndrome (RTT). Yet, long-term memory deficits in RTT animal models remain poorly understood, largely due to the technical challenges inherent in tracking neural activity over extended periods. Here, we used longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to follow the same population of hippocampal CA1 neurons as RTT mice and their littermate controls formed cognitive maps of their environment during a spatial learning task. Neural representations in RTT mice were marked by excessive place cell (PC) activity, with individual PCs exhibiting pronounced instability across days. This disrupted single-cell stability propagated to the population level, resulting in unstable ensemble codes that poorly retained previously learned task information. Both excessive PC recruitment and instability could be attributed to a higher incidence of behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) in RTT mice. In wild-type littermates, place-cell consolidation across days is reflected by an increased likelihood of neuron-specific synaptic plasticity at the location of prior PC coding. This cellular mechanism of memory consolidation based on the location of BTSP was disrupted in RTT mice, where excessive and ectopic plasticity reduced PC stability, and degraded long-term stable representations. Backed by theoretical modeling, these results identify a plausible cellular and circuit-level mechanism underlying memory impairments in RTT mice and suggest principles that may be generalized to other neurological disorders involving memory deficits.",

    "title": "Computational reconstruction of evolutionary selection in human brain networks",
    "content": "IntroductionThe accumulation of genomic and brain data opens new opportunities for resource friendly, data driven brain exploration. A key challenge is to develop versatile and accessible strategies that integrate and mine multimodal datasets for novel neuroscientific insights. Here, we optimized an integrated workflow for mapping multigenic evolutionary traits in the human brain across cognitive, cellular, and molecular levels.MethodsAt the input stage, the workflow fuses an evolutionary genetic dataset with searchable synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) databases that are pre clustered into concise psychological domains for improved interpretability. At its core, a Genetic Algorithm for Generalized Biclustering (GABi) mines gene sets under evolutionary selection that also show high expression correlation with fMRI networks.ResultsApplying this workflow, we identified evolutionary patterns spanning cognitive traits, brain cell types, and molecular mechanisms. Focusing on socio affective traits, the algorithm highlighted peaks in adaptive selection in networks for social interaction (language) and social concepts (theory of mind) across hominid, early hominin, and anatomically modern human (AMH) ancestry. These traits emerge from a broad spectrum of excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neuronal, as well as non neuronal, cell types. The associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched for cell signaling, synaptic organization, and neuronal morphology.DiscussionTogether, these findings demonstrate an integrated workflow for molecular to systems level exploration of the brain and provide new perspectives on the evolutionary history of human socio affective functions. This approach can be adapted to screen for functional traits in the context of mental disorders or applied to the brains of other phylogenies in a similar manner.",

    "title": "Patients with chronic ankle instability exhibit increased sensorimotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and superior temporal gyrus activation during single-leg stance: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study",
    "content": "IntroductionBalance deficits are associated with clinical manifestations in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI); however, evidence of cortical plasticity related to balance control remains insufficient. This study aimed to evaluate cortical activity and balance differences between patients with CAI and healthy individuals during single-leg stance, with or without vision, and to explore the correlations between brain blood flow signals and homeostatic function to elucidate the neurophysiological changes in balance control.MethodsThis cohort study involved 30 patients with CAI from a single hospital and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Cortical activity in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The activity ranges of the center of mass (COM), acceleration, and acceleration extremes were calculated using wearable inertial sensors. Moreover, scale assessments (visual analog scale, foot and ankle ability measure, and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool) and functional tests (classical balance, Y-balance, multi-directional reach tests, and timed up-and-go tests) were conducted.ResultsSignificant between-group effects were observed for the root mean square (RMS) centroid acceleration in the anteroposterior (AP) direction (F = 5.51, p = 0.02), whereas within- and between-group differences existed for RMS centroid acceleration in the mediolateral (ML) direction (F = 3.56, p = 0.03; F = 8.5, p = 0.004). Significant within- and between-group differences were identified for peak acceleration magnitude (Acc_max) \u2013AP (F = 7.85, p = 0.001; F = 11.83, p = 0.001) and Acc_max\u2013ML (F = 15.64, p = 0.0001; F = 5.06, p = 0.026). The oxyhemoglobin concentration change (\u0394HbO2) was significantly greater in patients with CAI than in healthy controls during single-leg stance; between-group differences were identified in the STG\u2013right cerebral hemisphere (R) (F = 10.25, p = 0.002), DLPFC\u2013R (F = 50.99, p = 0.001), SMC\u2013R (F = 27.48, p = 0.0001), STG\u2013left cerebral hemisphere (L) (F = 13.6, p = 0.0001), DLPFC\u2013L (F = 24.21, p = 0.0001), and SMC\u2013L (F = 29.75, p = 0.0001); within-group differences in the SMC\u2013L (F = 9.92, p = 0.0001); and interaction effects in the STG\u2013R (F = 5.73, p = 0.004). During right-leg stance with the eyes closed, RMS\u2013ML and Acc_max\u2013ML exhibited a high positive correlation with \u0394HbO2 in the STG\u2013L (RMS\u2013ML: p = 0.001, r = 0.72; Acc_max\u2013ML: p = 0.001, r = 0.74).ConclusionPatients with CAI exhibited lower balance ability and greater COM bias than healthy controls, with increased bilateral activation in brain regions, regardless of which limb was elevated; the results were more pronounced with vision inhibited. Enhanced brain activity was positively correlated with COM changes. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy and wearable inertial sensors can detect balance in patients with CAI.",

    "title": "Functional mapping of the somatotopic organization of the supplementary motor area using navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and computer vision-based analysis",
    "content": "BackgroundThe supplementary motor area (SMA) is a cortical region involved in motor and language functions. Motor representations within the SMA follow a somatotopic organization: Anterior regions are linked to orofacial movements, middle regions to upper limb movements, and posterior regions to lower limb movements. SMA lesions may produce impairments that correspond to this somatotopy; therefore, preoperative assessment may aid diagnosis.ObjectiveThis study aimed to revise and extend a protocol for assessing the SMA using navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS), incorporating somatotopic organization and validating positive stimulation points against non-motor regions.MethodsThe dominant-hemisphere SMA of 30 healthy participants (27.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.21\u202fyears, 18 female) was examined. After mapping of the primary motor cortex with single-pulse TMS, six predefined SMA sites were stimulated using 20\u202fHz nrTMS while participants performed the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT; 120% resting motor threshold (RMT)), the lower extremity motor coordination test (LEMOCOT; 140% RMT), and an orofacial task (130% RMT). Each test was repeated under identical parameters at non-motor control sites. Kinematic measurements were obtained using high-speed recordings.ResultsSMA stimulation disrupted upper extremity function, with the strongest effects observed at posterior sites. In contrast, lower extremity performance was not impaired during SMA stimulation, where tapping speed increased under validation conditions. Orofacial effects were limited and inconsistent, occurring mainly during stimulation outside the SMA and showing no significant spatial pattern.ConclusionThe expected somatotopic organization of the SMA could not be demonstrated using nrTMS. However, SMA-selective disruptions of upper extremity movements suggest a functional, rather than effector-specific, organization. The novel kinematic paradigm enabled detailed, objective analysis of movement phases and may benefit future TMS studies.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "title": "Decoding of speech acoustics from EEG: going beyond the amplitude envelope",
    "content": "Objective. During speech perception, properties of the acoustic stimulus can be reconstructed from the listener\u2019s brain using methods such as electroencephalography (EEG). Most studies employ the amplitude envelope as a target for decoding; however, speech acoustics can be characterised on multiple dimensions, including as spectral descriptors. The current study assesses how robustly an extended acoustic feature set can be decoded from EEG under varying levels of intelligibility and acoustic clarity. Approach. Analysis was conducted using EEG from 38 young adults who heard intelligible and non-intelligible speech that was either unprocessed or spectrally degraded using vocoding. We extracted a set of acoustic features which, alongside the envelope, characterised instantaneous properties of the speech spectrum (e.g. spectral slope) or spectral change over time (e.g. spectral flux). We establish the robustness of feature decoding by employing multiple model architectures and, in the case of linear decoders, by standardising decoding accuracy (Pearson\u2019s r) using randomly permuted surrogate data. Main results. Linear models yielded the highest r relative to non-linear models. However, the separate decoder architectures produced a similar pattern of results across features and experimental conditions. After converting r values to Z-scores scaled by random data, we observed substantive differences in the noise floor between features. Decoding accuracy significantly varies by spectral degradation and speech intelligibility for some features, but such differences are reduced in the most robustly decoded features. This suggests acoustic feature reconstruction is primarily driven by generalised auditory processing. Significance. Our results demonstrate that linear decoders perform comparably to non-linear decoders in capturing the EEG response to speech acoustic properties beyond the amplitude envelope, with the reconstructive accuracy of some features also associated with understanding and spectral clarity. This sheds light on how sound properties are differentially represented by the brain and shows potential for clinical applications moving forward.",

    "title": "Temporal interference stimulator realized with silicon chip for non-invasive neuromodulation",
    "content": "Objective. Temporal interference stimulation (TIS) has emerged as an innovative and promising approach for non-invasive stimulation. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy and performance of TIS using benchtop instruments, a dedicated system-on-chip for TIS applications has not yet been reported. This work addresses this gap by presenting a design for a TIS chip that enhances portability, thereby facilitating wearable applications of TIS. Approach. A miniaturized dual-channel temporal interference stimulator for non-invasive neuro-modulation is proposed and fabricated in a 0.18 \u00b5m CMOS BCD process. The TIS chip occupies the silicon area of only 2.66 mm2. It generates output signals with a maximum amplitude of \u00b15 V and reliable frequency, with programmable input parameters to accommodate diverse biomedical applications. The carrier frequencies of the generated signals include 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 3 kHz, combined with beat frequencies of 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 20 Hz. This results in a total of nine available operation modes, enabling effective TIS. Main results. The proposed chip has effectively generated temporally interfering signals with reliable frequency and amplitude. To validate the efficacy of the TIS chip, in-vivo animal experiments have been conducted, demonstrating its ability to produce effective electrical stimulation signals that successfully elicit neural responses in the deep brain of a pig. Significance. This work has replaced the bulky external stimulator with a fully integrated silicon chip, significantly enhancing portability and supporting future wearable clinical applications.",

    "content": "Schizophrenia is associated with profound working memory deficits, for which there are no approved treatments. Rare heterozygous null mutations in SETD1A, a gene encoding a key epigenetic regulatory protein, have been definitively linked to increased risk for schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders. To investigate how SETD1A haploinsufficiency impacts the function of circuits supporting working memory, this study examined neural oscillatory synchrony across a network of brain regions critical for spatial working memory (SWM) in mice carrying a loss-of-function allele in the orthologous SETD1A gene. Local field potential recordings were performed in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and thalamic nucleus reuniens in male and female wildtype and Setd1a+/- mice performing a delayed non-match to sample task of SWM. Setd1a+/- mice exhibited unaltered prefrontal-hippocampal neural oscillatory synchrony across frequencies and task epochs. In contrast, Setd1a+/- mice displayed reduced beta-frequency synchrony between the prefrontal cortex and nucleus reuniens during SWM maintenance and blunted bidirectional modulation of prefrontal-reuniens beta- and gamma-frequency synchrony across SWM task epochs. Collectively, this work expands our understanding of how genetic risk for schizophrenia alters functional connectivity within distributed circuits supporting SWM.",

    "title": "Dissociation of Striosome and Matrix Activation in the Human Striatum During the Cue and Execution Phases of Working Memory",
    "content": "The striatum comprises two neurochemically and anatomically distinct tissue compartments, the striosome and matrix, that are hypothesized to support different aspects of cognition and action. In animal studies, the striosome has been linked to reward evaluation, emotional learning, and decision-making under conflict, whereas the matrix is more closely associated with sensorimotor integration and task execution. However, evidence for compartment-specific function in humans is limited and indirect. Using probabilistic tractography, we identified voxels with striosome-like and matrix-like patterns of structural connectivity in healthy adults. We then examined how these compartment-like voxels responded to task demands during an fMRI n-back working-memory paradigm that visually presented four stimulus categories (body part, face, place, or tool). We assessed activation in a low-load condition (0-back, remembering a just-viewed stimulus) vs. a high-load condition (2-back, remembering a stimulus viewed two prior). Functional activation was temporally segregated and matched our prior findings in motor tasks: striosome-like voxels were preferentially engaged during the cue and initial preparation phases, whereas matrix-like voxels dominated during task execution. Trial accuracy strongly modulated striatal activation, with both compartments showing significantly greater responses during \"correct\" than in \"error\" trials. Notably, the accuracy-related increase in activation was larger in striosome-like voxels, consistent with a prominent role for striosomal processing in performance evaluation. Both striosome- and matrix-like voxels significantly increased activation from 0-back to 2-back, indicating sensitivity to working-memory load, with larger increases for matrix-like than for striosome-like voxels. Category-selective responses also differed by compartment and cognitive load. Under low working-memory load (0-back), stimulus-category effects were modest and broadly similar between compartments. Under higher load (2-back), activation in striosome-like voxels remained selective for specific stimulus categories, while matrix-like voxels lost category specificity. Together, these findings suggest that the striosome-matrix distinction generalizes from motor to cognitive domains, reflecting a conserved division between preparatory and execution-related processes that varies systematically with task demands, memory category, and performance accuracy. This convergence of compartment-specific responses across domains points to a core organizational principle of the human striatum with potential implications for neuropsychiatric diseases.",

    "title": "Microstructural Disruption of the Forceps Minor in Schizophrenia: A Potential Clinical Imaging Biomarker Using Translational DTI",
    "content": "Schizophrenia is one of the most complex brain disorders, arising from multidimensional pathophysiological processes that span genetic vulnerability, neurotransmitter dysregulation, structural brain damage, and large-scale brain network dysfunction. Large-scale neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated the critical role of frontal brain regions in schizophrenia. Despite substantial progress, the precise localization of structural damage within these regions and the neurobiological mechanisms linking such alterations to disease pathology remain poorly understood. In this study, we included a total of 115 subjects from two sites of the B-SNIP dataset, comprising 60 healthy controls and 55 individuals with schizophrenia. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to precisely characterize specific structural alterations in the frontal brain regions associated with schizophrenia. Our findings reveal significant microstructural abnormalities in the forceps minor, a major commissural white-matter tract that serves as a critical interhemispheric bridge between the bilateral frontal lobes. Network-level mapping further demonstrates that the forceps minor is closely integrated with large-scale brain networks, particularly the default mode network, and maintains strong structural connectivity with orbitofrontal regions-both of which are known to exhibit dysfunction in schizophrenia. Moreover, converging evidence suggests that the forceps minor plays an important role in the regulation of social behavior, a core domain of impairment in schizophrenia. Collectively, these findings identify the forceps minor as a promising structural imaging biomarker for schizophrenia and provide novel insights into the microstructural mechanisms underlying the disorder.",

    "content": "Creativity is one of the unique cognitive constructs in human beings and its neurobiological correlates are one of the current hot topics in neuroscience. The Different Hearing program (DHP) is an educational activity aimed at stimulating musical creativity by means of group composing in the classroom, alternative to the mainstream model of music education in Czechia. In our previous study, the data from task-related functional MRI with passive listening was analyzed. The results suggested that DHP training modified the response to diverse sound samples, differentially changing the engagement of functional networks known to be related to creative thinking, namely, increasing default mode network activation and decreasing activation of executive and salience networks. In the present study, we hypothesized that the DHP short-term (2 days) intense workshop would also induce changes in the resting-state networks that were significantly modified during task. To investigate it, seed-based, ROI-to-ROI resting-state functional connectivity and degree centrality analysis were performed on the acquired resting-state fMRI data. The results showed no significant group-by-time interaction.",

Conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields is a promising method to reduce the uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) and combined EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis due to inter-individual variations of tissue conductivities. Approaches for skull conductivity estimation based on evoked potentials and fields have been proposed in several studies, but the current knowledge about their sensitivity towards uncertainties of other tissue conductivities and the effects on source analysis accuracy is insufficient. In this study, we analyze this sensitivity for EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation and to what extent skull conductivity estimation improves the EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Approach. We simulated EEG and MEG measurements of evoked brain activity and IEDs for randomly assigned tissue conductivities and performed EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation for the simulated measurements. Following, we performed EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of the simulated IEDs and compared the results with and without using the individually estimated skull conductivities. Main results. We find that EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation is more accurate than EEG skull conductivity estimation, especially when considering realistic noise levels, whereas the type of the evoked brain activity only had a minor influence on the accuracy of the conductivity estimation. Both EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation clearly improve source analysis accuracy for EEG and combined EEG/MEG source analysis, reducing the uncertainty of the source localization from a few centimeters to less than one centimeter for most sources. However, we find that the effect of the conductivity estimation is less pronounced for sources at the base of the brain. Significance. EEG and EEG/MEG conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields has the potential to become a valuable tool to reduce uncertainty in source analysis of IEDs, while it only requires little additional measurement effort.",

    "content": "Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) present a profound clinical enigma, manifesting as a heterogeneous continuum ranging from the chaotic volatility of acute psychosis to the impenetrable rigidity of systematized delusions. While neurobiological research has independently implicated NMDA receptor hypofunction or dopaminergic hyperfunction as cardinal pathophysiological distinct mechanisms, a computational framework capable of bridging these distinct cellular deficits to the spectrum's vast phenomenological diversity remains elusive. Here, we propose a biologically plausible neural model using a dynamic Bayesian inference with separable positive and negative prediction-error pathways. We demonstrate that NMDA hypofunction selectively blunts negative prediction errors, fostering rigid, bias-dominated beliefs, while dopaminergic hyperfunction uniformly amplifies error signals, driving volatile, observation-dominated states. Their interaction reconstructs SSDs as a continuous bias-volatility spectrum, accounting for key neurophysiological markers and offering a theoretical foundation for mechanism-based patient stratification.",

    "title": "Reward-driven emergence of auditory pattern encoding in the primate motor system",
    "content": "The ability to anticipate rhythmic patterns is fundamental to human experience, enabling music appreciation, speech comprehension, and dancing in sync to music. How the brain learns to use acoustic information to guide motor behavior remains a key question whose neural underpinnings and evolutionary origins are debated, especially in non-human primates. To understand how brain areas involved in motor control naively respond to predictable tone patterns, we recorded large single neuron populations across primary somatosensory (S1), primary motor (M1), dorsal premotor (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA), pre-supplementary motor (preSMA) cortices, globus pallidus interna (GPi), and medial geniculate body (MGB) of a rhesus monkey. During passive listening (Experiment 1) with a reward only at the end of each trial, primarily the MGB, not motor areas, responded to the auditory tone patterns, ruling out the spontaneous entrainment of motor activity to auditory patterns. Almost all areas robustly represented the elapsed time within the trial, suggesting a general tracking of trial progression and reward structure. Next, we tested if motor areas learn to respond to auditory patterns if associated with rewards. When each tone was simultaneously accompanied by a liquid reward (Experiment 2), all areas except S1 showed clear responses to the tone patterns. To test if the tone responses persisted, the reward contingency was subsequently removed (Experiment 3). Strikingly, although the reward was delivered only at the trial's end as in Experiment 1, GPi neurons continued to track the occurrence of the tones. These findings suggest that while basic sensory processing of tone patterns occurs in the MGB, higher-order processing in motor areas is profoundly shaped by reward association. This reorganisation of neural responsiveness shows that the capacity for auditory association can be elicited in the motor system through appropriate motivational contexts.",

    "title": "A functional influence based circuit motif that constrains the set of plausible algorithms of cortical function",
    "content": "There are several plausible algorithms for cortical function that are specific enough to make testable predictions of the interactions between functionally identified cell types. Many of these algorithms are based on some variant of predictive processing. Here we set out to experimentally distinguish between two such predictive processing variants. A central point of variability between them lies in the proposed vertical communication between layer 2/3 and layer 5, which stems from the diverging assumptions about the computational role of layer 5. One assumes a hierarchically organized architecture and proposes that, within a given node of the network, layer 5 conveys unexplained bottom-up input to prediction error neurons of layer 2/3. The other proposes a non-hierarchical architecture in which internal representation neurons of layer 5 provide predictions for the local prediction error neurons of layer 2/3. We show that the functional influence of layer 2/3 cell types on layer 5 is incompatible with the hierarchical variant, while the functional influence of layer 5 cell types on prediction error neurons of layer 2/3 is incompatible with the non-hierarchical variant. Given these data, we can constrain the space of plausible algorithms of cortical function. We propose a model for cortical function based on a combination of a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) and predictive processing that makes experimentally testable predictions.",

    "title": "A Detailed Model for Understanding the Human Neocortex",
    "content": "The neocortex underlies cognitive abilities that set humans apart from other species. Although Ramon y Cajal initiated its study in the 19th century, much about its fundamental properties remain poorly understood. Biologically detail modeling, has been shown to serve as a tool to understand the modeled system better. By comparing computational models for different species we can highlight functional differences between them, find their anatomical or physiological basis and thus improve our understanding of cortical function. In this study we built a detailed model of a human cortical microcircuit following an established workflow. We compared the human data and results against a previously published reconstruction of rat cortical circuitry. To parametrize the human model, we gathered new original data on human morphological reconstructions, axonal bouton densities, single cell and synaptic recordings. We combined them with data available in the literature and open-sourced databases. We also developed various strategies to overcome the missing data, such as generalizing or adapt- ing data from rodents. The resulting model consists of seven columnar units with similar characteristics. Each column has a radius of 476 um, a height of 2622 um, a volume of 1.86 mm3, a total cell density of 24,186 cells/mm3, on the order of 35,000 cells, around 12 million connections and approximately 47 million synapses. Comparing the rat and the human model showed that the human cortex is less dense in terms of cell bodies than the rodent cortex. Human cells have more complex branching, but lower bouton densities than rodent cells. However, the number of connections between cell types is similar.",

    "title": "Push-and-pull protein dynamics leads to log-normal synaptic sizes and probabilistic multi-spine plasticity",
    "content": "A typical neuron receives thousands of inputs and is able to adapt the strength of its synapses to store new information and meet ongoing computational demands. The synaptic response to plasticity induction is stochastic and spatially structured but is traditionally described by deterministic models representing the enquote{average} dynamics. Growing experimental evidence indicates that not only the stimulation protocol determines the plasticity outcome but that the initial synaptic sizes, their fluctuations, and the spatial competition for the plasticity-relevant proteins play a decisive role. This probabilistic perspective makes it hard to predict the fate of a given synapse and requires a conceptual shift from a single synapse view to a probabilistic multi-spine competitive process where the plasticity needs and the available resources are considered together. Here, we propose a data-driven modeling framework able to predict collective plasticity outcomes along a dendrite based on the initial size, the number, and the spatial distance between simultaneously stimulated synapses. Our data analysis reveals a log-normal distribution of protein numbers for many plasticity-mediating proteins and shows that this log-normal protein allocation constrains and controls the collective plasticity outcome across multiple stimulated and non-stimulated synapses while preserving a global size distribution. Our findings highlight how local stochastic processes and global protein allocation rules give rise to synaptic plasticity outcomes, offering a new framework to understand and predict dendritic computation.",

    "title": "Network analysis of optimal deep or machine learning strategies for classification and detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease based on MRI scanning",
    "content": "BackgroundAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) presents a significant global health challenge, with its prevalence projected to increase substantially by 2050. Despite its widespread impact, the underlying causes and mechanisms remain incompletely understood, complicating efforts toward effective diagnosis and treatment. Pathologically, AD is marked by the accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, but the relationship between these factors and disease progression is complex and heterogeneous.ObjectiveThe present study aimed to compare the efficacy of different deep/machine learning models based on MRI scanning.MethodsThe study follows rigorous systematic review protocols, adhering to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and Interventions and the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was employed across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Medline, and EMBASE. Advanced statistical methods were used for data synthesis and analysis, incorporating network meta-analysis and machine learning techniques to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy of different diagnostic models.ResultsThe meta-analysis included 11 studies that met the predefined inclusion criteria. The studies employed various machine learning algorithms, including CNN, ResNet, and DenseNet, to classify AD and distinguish it from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. The results indicate that CNN and ResNet consistently outperform other models in terms of classification accuracy. Additionally, the integration of nanotechnology and AI-driven diagnostics demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the diagnostic process.ConclusionDespite challenges such as data heterogeneity and the interpretability of AI-driven models, the study highlights the transformative potential of computational techniques and advanced imaging technologies in AD diagnosis and management. The integration of network-based analyses and machine learning approaches offers promising avenues for future research, aiming to revolutionize the understanding and approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

    "title": "Decoding the mechanisms of acupuncture by neuroimaging: an integrated review from networks to molecules",
    "content": "Acupuncture, a cornerstone of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is widely used for conditions like chronic pain and functional disorders, yet its neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. This review synthesizes findings from multimodal neuroimaging\u2013including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET)\u2013to examine the central nervous system and neurochemical correlates of acupuncture. We summarize reports of its modulatory effects on large-scale brain networks (e.g., Default Mode Network, Salience Network) and neural oscillations, alongside evidence of neurochemical changes. Importantly, we also address the methodological limitations, inconsistent results, and significant role of non-specific (e.g., placebo) effects prevalent in this literature (Chen B. et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024). Building on this evidence, we propose a multi-level integrative framework that outlines a potential pathway from peripheral stimulation to clinical outcomes via neurochemical and network-level interactions, while carefully distinguishing observed correlations from established causation. We conclude by discussing future research priorities, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols, rigorous causal inference, and a measured approach to translating emerging technologies. This review aims to bridge traditional practice with modern neuroscience by offering a balanced perspective that highlights both progress and persistent challenges in the field.",

    "title": "Neuroanatomically informed psychotherapy after mild brain injury: a single-case report of clinical improvement",
    "content": "Psychotherapeutic interventions following acquired brain injury often underestimate the influence of neural connectivity on emotional and cognitive recovery, contributing to treatment response variability. We present a single-case report of an adult with mild acquired brain injury, in whom diffusion tensor imaging (tractography) and neuropsychological assessment were integrated to guide individualized clinical planning. Baseline tractography revealed globally preserved white-matter organization with rightward asymmetries in the uncinate and superior longitudinal fasciculi\u2013pathways involved in cognitive\u2013emotional integration. This specific neuroanatomical profile informed a psychotherapeutic plan that prioritized attentional and experiential strategies, being functionally compatible with the preserved networks, over those requiring complex verbal-analytic processing. After 1 year of intervention (approximately 40 sessions), reassessment documented significant functional improvements, quantified by a reduction in anxiety to a non-clinical range (HADS-A: 11 \u2192 6) and a normalization in cognitive flexibility (TMT-B: 190 \u2192 128 s), without observable structural change. These findings validate the hypothesis that therapeutic change may arise from functional optimization within preserved networks rather than anatomical reorganization. This report proposes the functional compatibility framework as a transferable and theoretically grounded model for precision psychotherapy, bridging the gap between neuroscience and clinical practice.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "title": "Evaluating haptic experience using EEG and deep learning across multiple modalities: linking stimulus and self-reports",
    "content": "Conventionally, evaluations of haptic interfaces have relied on self-reported assessments, which offer limited objectivity and can disrupt the user experience, making it challenging to design interfaces that dynamically adapt to users' cognitive state in real time. To overcome these limitations, cognitive haptic interfaces leverage neurophysiological measures such as EEG and deep learning to directly capture the brain's responses to haptic stimulation. A key challenge is how to label these neural responses: do we ground models in objectively controlled Physical Stimulation (PS) parameters, or in participants' Self-Reported (SR) perceptions? The goal of this work is not to demonstrate that EEG can reproduce subjective reports, but rather to systematically examine how neural responses relate to these two aspects of haptic experience by training deep learning models under both PS and SR labeling schemes. Here, we investigate how PS- versus SR-based labeling impacts model performance across four modalities: (i) delayed force-feedback (DFF), (ii) fingertip vibration feedback (FVF), (iii) upper-body vibration feedback (UVF), and (iv) fingertip thermal feedback (FTF). We evaluate three deep learning benchmarked architectures: ATCNet, EEG Inception, and EEG Conformer on EEG data labeled according to both approaches. Across all modalities, PS-labeled models yield more stable and higher performance than SR-labeled models in a group-level leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting, with the largest gains at near-perceptual-threshold levels (e.g., mild thermal changes, moderate vibration intensities, borderline delay settings) where SR labels are most variable across individuals. Rather than aiming to replace self-reports, these results reveal when EEG-based models align more closely with the physical stimulation than with participants' reports and support using PS-trained decoders as a structured first-stage representation that can later be adapted with user-specific SR information.",

    "title": "Structural and functional alterations in postmenopausal women with insomnia: an MRI study of Eight-Section Vajra Exercise intervention effects",
    "content": "BackgroundPostmenopausal women exhibit heightened vulnerability to chronic insomnia due to estrogen decline and age-related neural alterations. While non-pharmacological interventions are preferred for long-term management, the neuroplastic mechanisms underlying exercise-based therapies remain poorly characterized.MethodsThis study examines the effects of Eight-Section Vajra Exercise (ESVE) on brain structure and function in postmenopausal women with insomnia (PMWI) using multimodal MRI. A 12-week ESVE training program was completed by PMWI patients, followed by clinical assessments (PSQI, ISI, PHQ-9, GAD-7, FSS, MoCA) and neuroimaging (fMRI and structural MRI). Data analysis involved gray matter volume (GMV), ALFF/fALFF, ReHo, degree centrality (DC), and functional connectivity (FC) using advanced MRI processing techniques (CAT12, SPM12, DPABI). Group comparisons and correlations were adjusted for age, education, and intracranial volume.ResultAmong the 24 PMWI patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs), baseline measures showed significantly worse sleep and mood scores in PMWI. Resting-state fMRI revealed reduced ALFF/fALFF in the right precentral gyrus and decreased ReHo in sensorimotor areas. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) were noted, with altered connections between precentral gyrus, temporal and parietal regions. After 12 weeks of ESVE, 78.95% of PMWI patients were medication-free, with post-treatment fMRI showing improved neural activity and connectivity, correlating with clinical improvement. Exercise adherence positively correlated with sleep quality improvement (r = 0.508\u20130.594, P < 0.05). Responders showed significant improvements in sleep compared to non-responders (P < 0.05).ConclusionESVE alleviates postmenopausal insomnia through PreCG-centered sensorimotor-visual network reorganization, potentially compensating for estrogen-dependent neurocircuitry vulnerabilities. Exercise-induced GMV increases in occipitotemporal regions suggest enhanced sleep-related memory consolidation. Our findings indicate that ESVE is a potential neuromodulatory intervention and identify PreCG-MOG connectivity as a promising biomarker for personalized insomnia management.",

    "content": "IntroductionAuditory beat perception (ABP) is crucial for rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), a therapeutic approach for neurological disorders, and particularly Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). The mechanism is thought to be associated with increased activation of the cerebellum and motor-related regions. However, few studies have explored its effects on patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). This study aimed to compare the compensatory mechanism of ABP in patients with PD and MSA.MethodsParticipants with PD and MSA and normal controls (NCs) were recruited from National Cheng Kung University Hospital. During task-based functional MRI (fMRI), the participants listened to rhythmic beat sounds using a boxcar paradigm. Basic characteristics and brain volumes were compared between the PD and MSA groups, and fMRI findings were further compared with the NCs.ResultsThere were no significant differences in age, gender, motor scores or disease duration between PD (n\u202f=\u202f16) and MSA (n\u202f=\u202f14) groups. Brain volume analysis revealed a significant reduction in cerebellar volume in the MSA group. ABP analysis via fMRI demonstrated greater activation in the left premotor cortex in MSA groups compared to NCs. Activation in the right cerebellum was significantly higher in PD group but absent in the MSA group. Different correlation trends between activation and cerebellar volume were observed.ConclusionABP in the PD and MSA groups showed distinct compensatory mechanisms by cerebellar and premotor cortex activation, respectively. These findings provide insights into compensatory mechanisms regarding RAS therapy in patients with atypical parkinsonian disorders.",

Six functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, comprising 95 individuals with ASD and 98 NCs, met the inclusion criteria.ResultsThe analysis revealed that during figurative language comprehension, both ASD and NCs consistently activated a core network involving the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), transverse temporal gyrus, and right insula. A conjunction analysis confirmed the stability of these shared regions. Crucially, the meta-analysis of group differences (NCs\u202f>\u202fASD) identified a significant cluster of hypoactivation in the ASD group within the left STG and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). No significant hyperactivation was found in the ASD group compared to NCs.ConclusionThis meta-analysis demonstrates that while individuals with ASD recruit typical language networks during figurative language comprehension, they exhibit a consistent pattern of reduced neural recruitment in the left STG and MTG. This hypoactivation may reflect a dual deficit encompassing reduced efficiency in semantic access/integration and impaired socio-linguistic integration, providing a neurobiological substrate for the pragmatic language difficulties characteristic of ASD.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42023467185, CRD42023467185.",

Instead of viewing AI merely as a technical tool, the analysis emphasizes the importance of embedding AI into communication, collaboration, and decision-making processes within organizations from a human-centered perspective. Ten case-based patterns illustrate how AI support of predictive maintenance can be organized to address quality assurance and continuous improvement and to provide different types of sup-port for HCAI. The analysis shows that AI adoption often requires and enables new forms of organizational learning, where specialists jointly interpret AI output, adapt workflows, and refine rules for system improve-ment. Different dimensions and levels of socio-technical integration of AI are considered to reflect the effort and benefits of keeping the organization in the loop.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.21490v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mutual trust between teachers and students is a prerequisite for effective teaching, learning, and assessment in higher education. Accurate predictions about the other group's use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) are fundamental for such trust. However, the disruptive rise of AI has transformed academic work practices, raising important questions about how teachers and students use these tools and how well they can estimate each other's usage. While the frequency of use is well studied, little is known about how AI is used, and comparisons with similar practices are rare. This study surveyed German university teachers (N = 113) and students (N = 123) on the frequency of AI use and the degree of delegation across six identical academic tasks. Participants also provided incentivized cross-sample predictions of the other group's AI use to assess the accuracy of their predictions. We find that students reported higher use of AI and greater delegation than teachers. Both groups significantly overestimated the other group's use, with teachers predicting very frequent use and high delegation by students, and students assuming teachers use AI similarly to themselves. These findings reveal a perception gap between teachers' and students' expectations and actual AI use. Such gaps may hinder trust and effective collaboration, underscoring the need for open dialogue about AI practices in academia and for policies that support the equitable and transparent integration of AI tools in higher education.",

Results show that, in the default condition, participants who believed they had a clearer understanding of the event were more likely to trust GPT's output, whereas in the guided condition, participants showed stronger alignment between subjective clarity and actual recall. Additionally, participants evaluated the legitimacy of the individuals in the incident differently across conditions.

Hearing is a primary channel for sensing context, anticipating change, and navigating social space, yet AAR's everyday potential remains underexplored. We address this gap through a collaborative autoethnography (N=5, authoring) and an online survey (N=74). We identify ten roles for AAR, grouped into three categories: task- and utility-oriented, emotional and social, and perceptual collaborator. These roles are further layered with a rhythmic and embodied collaborator framing, mapping them onto micro-, meso-, and macro-rhythms of everyday life. Our analysis surfaces nuanced tensions, such as blocking distractions without erasing social presence, highlighting the need for context-aware design. This paper contributes a foundational and forward-looking framework for AAR in everyday life, providing design groundwork for systems attuned to daily routines, sensory engagement, and social expectations.",

    "title": "Evaluating Spatialized Auditory Cues for Rapid Attention Capture in XR",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.21264v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In time-critical eXtended reality (XR) scenarios where users must rapidly reorient their attention to hazards, alerts, or instructions while engaged in a primary task, spatial audio can provide an immediate directional cue without occupying visual bandwidth. However, such scenarios can afford only a brief auditory exposure, requiring users to interpret sound direction quickly and without extended listening or head-driven refinement. This paper reports a controlled exploratory study of rapid spatial-audio localization in XR. Using HRTF-rendered broadband stimuli presented from a semi-dense set of directions around the listener, we quantify how accurately users can infer coarse direction from brief audio alone. We further examine the effects of short-term visuo-auditory feedback training as a lightweight calibration mechanism. Our findings show that brief spatial cues can convey coarse directional information, and that even short calibration can improve users' perception of aural signals. While these results highlight the potential of spatial audio for rapid attention guidance, they also show that auditory cues alone may not provide sufficient precision for complex or high-stakes tasks, and that spatial audio may be most effective when complemented by other sensory modalities or visual cues, without relying on head-driven refinement. We leverage this study on spatial audio as a preliminary investigation into a first-stage attention-guidance channel for wearable XR (e.g., VR head-mounted displays and AR smart glasses), and provide design insights on stimulus selection and calibration for time-critical use.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.21141v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents AnthropoCam, a mobile-based neural style transfer (NST) system optimized for the visual synthesis of Anthropocene environments. Unlike conventional artistic NST, which prioritizes painterly abstraction, stylizing human-altered landscapes demands a careful balance between amplifying material textures and preserving semantic legibility. Industrial infrastructures, waste accumulations, and modified ecosystems contain dense, repetitive patterns that are visually expressive yet highly susceptible to semantic erosion under aggressive style transfer.\n  To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the impact of NST parameter configurations on the visual translation of Anthropocene textures, including feature layer selection, style and content loss weighting, training stability, and output resolution. Through controlled experiments, we identify an optimal parameter manifold that maximizes stylistic expression while preventing semantic erasure. Our results demonstrate that appropriate combinations of convolutional depth, loss ratios, and resolution scaling enable the faithful transformation of anthropogenic material properties into a coherent visual language.\n  Building on these findings, we implement a low-latency, feed-forward NST pipeline deployed on mobile devices. The system integrates a React Native frontend with a Flask-based GPU backend, achieving high-resolution inference within 3-5 seconds on general mobile hardware. This enables real-time, in-situ visual intervention at the site of image capture, supporting participatory engagement with Anthropocene landscapes.\n  By coupling domain-specific NST optimization with mobile deployment, AnthropoCam reframes neural style transfer as a practical and expressive tool for real-time environmental visualization in the Anthropocene.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.21057v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The recent success of deep learning (DL) has enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic gaze data. However, such data also raises privacy concerns because gaze sequences can encode subjects' internal states, like fatigue, emotional load, or stress. Ideally, synthetic gaze should preserve the signal quality of real recordings and remove or attenuate state-related, privacy-sensitive attributes. Many recent DL-based generative models focus on replicating real gaze trajectories and do not explicitly consider subjective reports or the privatization of internal states. However, in this work, we consider a recent diffusion-based gaze synthesis approach and examine correlations between synthetic gaze features and subjective reports (e.g., fatigue and related self-reported states). Our result shows that these correlations are trivial, which suggests the generative approach suppresses state-related features. Moreover, synthetic gaze preserves necessary signal characteristics similar to those of real data, which supports its use for privacy-preserving gaze-based applications.",

In this work, we focus on determining whether objective gaze dynamics can reliably predict subjective reports across repeated recording rounds in the eye-tracking dataset. We formulate subjective-report prediction as a supervised regression problem and propose a DenseNet-based deep learning regressor that learns predictive representations from gaze velocity signals. We conduct two complementary experiments to clarify our aims. First, the cross-round generalization experiment tests whether models trained on earlier rounds transfer to later rounds, evaluating the models' ability to capture longitudinal changes. Second, cross-subject generalization tests models' robustness by predicting subjective outcomes for new individuals. These experiments aim to reduce reliance on hand-crafted feature designs and clarify which states of subjective experience systematically appear in oculomotor behavior over time.",

While biomechanical simulations can illuminate motor control processes, they have not yet been developed for touch interactions. To close this gap, we propose a novel computational problem: synthesizing plausible motion directly from logs. Our key insight is a reinforcement learning-driven musculoskeletal forward simulation that generates biomechanically plausible motion sequences consistent with events recorded in touch logs. We achieve this by integrating a software emulator into a physics simulator, allowing biomechanical models to manipulate real applications in real-time. Log2Motion produces rich syntheses of user movements from touch logs, including estimates of motion, speed, accuracy, and effort. We assess the plausibility of generated movements by comparing against human data from a motion capture study and prior findings, and demonstrate Log2Motion in a large-scale dataset. Biomechanical motion synthesis provides a new way to understand log data, illuminating the ergonomics and motor control underlying touch interactions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.10835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.",

    "title": "Numerical Twin with Two Dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck Processes of Transient Oscillations in EEG signal",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.21768v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Stochastic burst-like oscillations are common in physiological signals, yet there are few compact generative models that capture their transient structure. We propose a numerical-twin framework that represents transient narrowband activity as a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with three interpretable parameters: decay rate, mean frequency, and noise amplitude. We develop two complementary estimation strategies. The first fits the power spectral density, amplitude distribution, and autocorrelation to recover OU-parameters. The second segments burst events and performs a statistical match between empirical spindle statistics (duration, amplitude, inter-event interval) and simulated OU output via grid search, resolving parameter degeneracies by including event counts. We extend the framework to multiple frequency bands and piecewise-stationary dynamics to track slow parameter drifts. Applied to electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during general anesthesia, the method identifies OU models that reproduce alpha-spindle (8-12 Hz) morphology and band-limited spectra with low residual error, enabling real-time tracking of state changes that are not apparent from band power alone. This decomposition yields a sparse, interpretable representation of transient oscillations and provides interpretable metrics for brain monitoring.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.09506v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Complex systems produce high-dimensional signals that lack macroscopic variables analogous to entropy, temperature, or free energy. This work introduces a thermoinformational formulation that derives entropy, internal energy, temperature, and Helmholtz free energy directly from empirical microstate distributions of arbitrary datasets. The approach provides a data-driven description of how a system reorganizes, exchanges information, and moves between stable and unstable states. Applied to dual-EEG recordings from mother-infant dyads performing the A-not-B task, the formulation captures increases in informational heat during switches and errors, and reveals that correct choices arise from more stable, low-temperature states. In an independent optogenetic dam-pup experiment, the same variables separate stimulation conditions and trace coherent trajectories in thermodynamic state space. Across both human and rodent systems, this thermoinformational formulation yields compact and physically interpretable macroscopic variables that generalize across species, modalities, and experimental paradigms.",

Drawing on empirical evidence, we explore hippocampal spatial representations, visual classification in the inferotemporal cortex, perceptual adaptation and priming, and working-memory biases shaped by sensory history.

    "content": "arXiv:2601.21407v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence represent distinct yet complementary pathways to general intelligence. However, amid the ongoing boom in AI research and applications, the translational synergy between these two fields has grown increasingly elusive-hampered by a widening infrastructural incompatibility: modern AI frameworks lack native support for biophysical realism, while neural simulation tools are poorly suited for gradient-based optimization and neuromorphic hardware deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure that provides comprehensive support for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning. By addressing algorithmic, computational, and deployment challenges, BrainFuse exhibits three core capabilities: (1) algorithmic integration of detailed neuronal dynamics into a differentiable learning framework; (2) system-level optimization that accelerates customizable ion-channel dynamics by up to 3,000x on GPUs; and (3) scalable computation with highly compatible pipelines for neuromorphic hardware deployment. We demonstrate this full-stack design through both AI and neuroscience tasks, from foundational neuron simulation and functional cylinder modeling to real-world deployment and application scenarios. For neuroscience, BrainFuse supports multiscale biological modeling, enabling the deployment of approximately 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with 100 million synapses on a single neuromorphic chip while consuming as low as 1.98 W. For AI, BrainFuse facilitates the synergistic application of realistic biological neuron models, demonstrating enhanced robustness to input noise and improved temporal processing endowed by complex HH dynamics. BrainFuse therefore serves as a foundational engine to facilitate cross-disciplinary research and accelerate the development of next-generation bio-inspired intelligent systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.21508v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable success in fitting biological visual systems; however, their black-box nature inherently limits their utility for understanding brain function. Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding manifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns. Our 'tubularity' metric quantifies this stimulus-dependent development of neural activity as biologically plausible. The readout module achieves high fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, this study provides a window into the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns. Our findings suggest design changes that could bring neural foundation models into closer alignment with biological systems: introducing recurrence in early encoder stages, and constraining features in the readout module.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.21478v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Pathophysiolpgical modelling of brain systems from microscale to macroscale remains difficult in group comparisons partly because of the infeasibility of modelling the interactions of thousands of neurons at the scales involved. Here, to address the challenge, we present a novel approach to construct differential causal networks directly from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed network is based on conditionally coupled neuronal circuits which describe the average behaviour of interacting neuron populations that contribute to observed EEG data. In the network, each node represents a parameterised local neural system while directed edges stand for node-wise connections with transmission parameters. The network is hierarchically structured in the sense that node and edge parameters are varying in subjects but follow a mixed-effects model. A novel evolutionary optimisation algorithm for parameter inference in the proposed method is developed using a loss function derived from Chen-Fliess expansions of stochastic differential equations. The method is demonstrated by application to the fitting of coupled Jansen-Rit local models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real EEG data. In the real EEG data analysis, we track changes in the parameters that characterise dynamic causality within brains that demonstrate epileptic activity. We show evidence of network functional disruptions, due to imbalance of excitatory-inhibitory interneurons and altered epileptic brain connectivity, before and during seizure periods.",

    "title": "Prior Scene Context Shapes the Neural Dynamics of Face Detection",
    "content": "Detecting faces in our surroundings typically only takes a fraction of a second. How can such a rapid perceptual process still be influenced by prior expectations? Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how prior scene context modulates the temporal dynamics of neural face representations. Participants viewed natural scenes containing a single face (left or right), each preceded by either a faceless version of the same scene (preview condition) or a gray screen (no-preview condition), while performing a face detection task. Using multivariate decoding, we found that face location could be decoded shortly after target onset. Critically, decoding accuracy was higher in the preview condition at early stages, whereas the no-preview condition showed higher decoding at later time points, suggesting rapid facilitation by prior context followed by compensatory processing when contextual information was absent. In contrast, time-frequency decoding revealed a sustained preview advantage across alpha, beta, and gamma bands, even during time periods when evoked responses favored the no-preview condition. This dissociation between evoked and induced neural signals indicates that prior scene context engages distinct neural processes: early evoked activity reflects rapid contextual facilitation of sensory representations, while induced oscillatory activity may support prolonged context-dependent modulation. Together, these results show how prior scene context and sensory-driven processing jointly shape rapid face perception through temporally and spectrally distinct neural dynamics.",

    "content": "Interpersonal affective touch, that preferentially engages C-tactile (CT) afferents, has been shown to produce analgesic effects, yet its role in pain sensitization remains poorly understood. This study explores whether touch delivered at CT-optimal parameters, either artificial or interpersonal, modulates secondary hyperalgesia (SH) induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Two experimental studies were conducted. In Study 1, 46 participants underwent SH induction during two conditions: robot stroking at CT-optimal velocities and vibrotactile stimulation. In Study 2, 64 participants (32 couples) experienced SH in two separate sessions: alone or accompanied by their partner delivering affective touch. Pain reports, electroencephalographic activity (N-P complex and time-frequency activity), electrocardiographic (ECG) and electrodermal activity data (EDA) were collected. HFS successfully established SH in both studies; however, no significant differences were found in the SH area between CT-stimulation and control conditions. In Study 2, partner-delivered affective touch significantly reduced reported acute pain during HFS compared to the alone condition, whereas no such effect was observed in Study 1 (robotic vs. vibrotactile). At the neural level, no condition effects were observed in the N-P complex, EEG time-frequency data and ECG indexes in either study. Tonic EDA after HFS was higher when participants received stroking from their romantic partner compared to being alone. No sex differences were observed. Overall, while affective touch from a romantic partner may reduce acute pain during nociceptive stimulation -an effect not observed with robotic CT-stimulation- neither robotic nor interpersonal affective touch appeared to modulate the development of secondary hyperalgesia.",

    "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

    "content": "Community detection is a crucial task in network research, applicable to social systems, biology, cybersecurity, and knowledge graphs. Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited significant representational capability; yet, they frequently experience instability and erroneous clustering, often referred to as \u201dhallucinations.\u201d These artifacts stem from sensitivity to high-frequency eigenmodes, over-parameterization, and noise amplification, undermining the robustness of learned communities. To mitigate these constraints, we present F2-CommNet, a Fourier\u2013Fractional neural framework that incorporates fractional-order dynamics, spectrum filtering, and Lyapunov-based stability analysis. The fractional operator implements long-memory dampening that mitigates oscillations, whereas Fourier spectral projections selectively attenuate eigenmodes susceptible to hallucination. Theoretical analysis delineates certain stability criteria under Lipschitz non-linearities and constrained disturbances, resulting in a demonstrable expansion of the Lyapunov margin. Experimental validation on synthetic and actual networks indicates that F2-CommNet reliably diminishes hallucination indices, enhances stability margins, and produces interpretable communities in comparison to integer-order GNN baselines. This study integrates fractional calculus, spectral graph theory, and neural network dynamics, providing a systematic method for hallucination-resistant community discovery.",

    "content": "IntroductionProbabilistic Stimulation Maps (PSMs) are increasingly employed to identify brain regions associated with optimal therapeutic outcomes in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). However, their reliability and generalizability are challenged by the limited size of most patient cohorts and the inherent variability introduced by different statistical methods and input data configurations. This study aimed to investigate the geometrical variability of Probabilistic Sweet Spots (PSS) as a function of both the number of patients (nPat) and the number of stimulations per patient (nStim), and to model a stability boundary defining the minimum data requirements for obtaining geometrically stable PSS.MethodsThree statistical approaches\u2013Bayesian t-test, Wilcoxon test with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction, and Wilcoxon test with nonparametric permutation correction\u2013were applied to two patient cohorts: a primary cohort of 36 patients undergoing DBS for Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), and a secondary cohort of 61 patients treated for Essential Tremor (ET), used to assess generalizability. Stimulation test data was collected intra-operatively for the first cohort and post-operatively for the second one. Geometric stability was evaluated based on variability in PSS volume extent and centroid location.ResultsThe analysis revealed a non-linear trade-off between nPat and nStim to yield stable PSS. A stability boundary was defined, representing the minimum combinations of nPat\u2013nStim required for anatomically robust PSS. Among the tested methods, the Bayesian t-test achieved stability with smaller sample sizes (\u223c15 patients) and demonstrated a consistent performance across both cohorts. In contrast, the Wilcoxon-based methods showed variable behavior between cohorts, which differed in symptom type and testing phase (intra-operative testing vs. post-operative screening).DiscussionThe proposed PSS stability boundary provides a practical reference for designing DBS studies and stimulation screening protocols aimed at probabilistic mapping. The Bayesian t-test emerged as a reliable method across both cohorts, supporting its potential in studies with limited sample sizes and scenarios where the method needs to be readily generalized to varying symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of considering both cohort size and stimulation count in probabilistic DBS mapping and call for further investigation into method-specific sensitivities to clinical and procedural factors.",

    "content": "Objective. Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease best known for its defining motor symptoms. However, it is also associated with significant cognitive impairment at all stages of the disease, with many patients eventually progressing to dementia. Therefore, there exists a significant need to identify objective functional biomarkers that better predict and monitor cognitive decline. While methods that analyse either spontaneous or evoked electroencephalogram (EEG), due to increasing practical usability and ostensible objectivity, have been investigated, current approaches are limited in that the associated measures are, in the absence of a theoretical basis, purely correlative. Approach. To address this shortcoming, we propose calculating changes in evoked EEG amplitude variability, quantified using information theoretic differential entropy (DE), during a three-level passive auditory oddball task, as it is argued this will directly index functional changes in cognition. We therefore estimate changes in stimulus-evoked DE in cognitively normal PD participants (N = 25), both on and off their medication, and in healthy age-matched controls (N = 25), and find substantial stimulus (standard, target, novel) and group differences. Main results. Notably, we find the time-course of the return of post-stimulus reductions in DE (i.e. information processing) to pre-stimulus levels delayed in PD compared to healthy controls, thus mirroring the assumed bradyphrenia. The observed changes in DE, together with the corollary increases in resting alpha (8\u201313 Hz) band activity seen in PD, are explained in the context of a well-known macroscopic theory of mammalian electrocortical activity, in terms of reduced tonic thalamo-cortical drive. Significance. This method of task-evoked DE EEG amplitude variability is expected to generalise to any situation where the objective determination of cognitive function is sought.",

So, over the last few weeks, I built a visual, drag-and-drop GUI designer that runs entirely in the browser.</p> <p><strong>The Tool:</strong> - <a href=\"https://pydesigner.qzz.io/\">PyDesigner Website</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/HasNetwork/PyDesigner\">Source Code</a></p> <p><strong>What it does:</strong></p> <p>My website is a drag-and-drop GUI designer with live preview. You can export and import projects (json format) and share them, export your build in different GUI frameworks, build and submit templates and widgets. The designer itself has many capabilities such as themes, sizes, properties, etc. It also embeds the image in base64 format for the window icon so that the script is fully portable. I have many more features planned so stay tuned!</p> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>Personal project developers, freelancers or professional GUI builders, everyone can use it for free! The designer has a very simple UI without much of learning curve, so anyone can build their own GUI in minutes.</p> <p><strong>How its Different:</strong> - <strong>Frameworks:</strong> It supports Tkinter, PyQt5 and CustomTkinter with more coming soon! - <strong>Privacy:</strong> Everything happens locally in your browser, using localstorage for caching and saving ongoing projects. - <strong>Web Interface:</strong> A simple web interface with the core options needed to build functional GUIs. - <strong>Clean Code Export:</strong> It generates a proper Python class structure, so you can actually import it into your main logic file. - <strong>Documentation:</strong> It has inbuilt documentation with examples for integrating the GUI with your backend logic code. - <strong>Asset Embedding:</strong> It converts images to Base64 strings automatically. You don't have to worry about &quot;file not found&quot; errors when sharing the script. - <strong>Dependencies:</strong> It has zero dependencies other than your chosen GUI framework and Pillow if you use images. - <strong>Community:</strong> In-built option to submit community-built templates and widgets.</p> <p>I know that the modern AI tools can develop a GUI in a single prompt, but you can't really visually edit it with live preview. I\u2019m a student and this is my first real tool, so I\u2019m looking for feedback (specifically on the generated code quality). If you find something unpythonic, let me know so I can fix the compiler\ud83d\ude09.</p> <h6>Note: I used AI to polish the English in this post since English isn't my native language. This tool is my personal learning project thus no AI has been used to develop this.</h6> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hashah2310\"> /u/Hashah2310 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqvp29/i_built_a_free_python_gui_designer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqvp29/i_built_a_free_python_gui_designer/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Progressive bilateral recruitment and resilient network reorganization during temporal lobe epilepsy",
    "content": "Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often originates from focal hippocampal injury but progressively evolves into a bilateral epileptic network engaging both hippocampi and distributed cortical regions. A mechanistic understanding of how this network emerges, and whether early perturbation of specific nodes can alter its trajectory, is essential for developing network-level therapeutic strategies. Objective: We used a kainate-induced rodent model of TLE to (1) characterize the spatiotemporal emergence of epileptic discharges during the latent phase, (2) determine how bilaterally synchronized events develop, and (3) test whether transient chemogenetic silencing of either the ipsilateral epileptogenic focus (EF) or the contralateral hippocampus (CH) modifies large-scale epileptogenesis. Methods: Freely moving mice were implanted with multisite electrodes spanning bilateral hippocampal subfields (dentate gyrus, CA1, subiculum) and cortical regions (M2, Cg1, PrL, V1, entorhinal cortex). Longitudinal LFP recordings were performed every other day during the latent and early chronic phases following KA or saline injection. DREADD-based chemogenetic inhibition of glutamatergic neurons was applied between days 2-7 post-KA. Epileptiform events were quantified via spike rates, waveform metrics, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and short-latency interregional co-spiking. Results: Early after KA, epileptic spiking emerged locally in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus and progressively organized into HFO-coupled discharges. Contralateral hippocampal recruitment followed a distinctive biphasic time course, characterized by transient early activation, subsequent suppression, and later re-emergence with increasing bilateral coactivation. Cortical regions gradually developed higher spike rates and enhanced DG-related co-spiking, indicating large-scale network integration. Ipsilateral silencing modified local spike composition but did not prevent global network progression, whereas contralateral silencing accelerated ipsilateral epileptogenesis and strengthened pathological HFO expression. Conclusion: Epileptogenesis in the KA model reflects a transition from a focal hippocampal insult to a resilient, bilateral cortico-hippocampal network. Targeting a single hippocampal node, even at early latent stage, is insufficient to halt this progression, highlighting the need for network-level therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "Cellular mechanisms underlying social regulation of the posterior tubercular nucleus in zebrafish (Danio rerio)",
    "content": "Social status profoundly influences animal behavior through neural plasticity, yet the cellular mechanisms that mediate reconfiguration of neuromodulatory systems remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated status-dependent structural changes in the posterior tubercular nucleus (PTN) of adult zebrafish. Animals were assigned to four social conditions: communal, isolated, dominant, or subordinate. Using markers for cell proliferation (PCNA) and birth-dating (BrdU), we demonstrate that social dominance significantly enhances neurogenesis, leading to an increased population of PTN dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, subordinate and isolated fish exhibited suppressed neurogenesis and elevated expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), suggesting that chronic social stress induces an oxidative burden that may lead to neuronal loss. Furthermore, we identified evidence of neurotransmitter phenotypic plasticity; subordinate fish displayed a significantly higher ratio of glutamatergic (vglut2a) to dopaminergic (dat) expression in PTN neurons compared to dominants, suggesting a status-dependent shift in neuromodulatory identity. Multivariate principal component analysis further revealed distinct neurobiological profiles that separate social ranks, suggesting that status-dependent plasticity is a coordinated multi-modal response. Collectively, our results improve our understanding of how social experience reshapes the zebrafish brain through integrated changes in cell proliferation, cellular shift in cellular identity and regulation of cellular viability; thus, providing a potential mechanism for the maintenance of stable behavioral phenotypes in competitive social environments.",

    "title": "Optimizing Network-Level TMS-fMRI: Benchmarking a Novel TMS-Compatible \"Sushi\" MR Coil",
    "content": "Introduction: Concurrent TMS-fMRI allows to observe how stimulation affects the target region and connected brain-wide networks. However, hardware limitations represent a major constraint: standard MR head coils provide high imaging sensitivity but no room for the TMS coil, whereas available TMS-compatible MR head coils offer access but low or strongly inhomogeneous signal. Methods: We developed and benchmarked a flexible \"Sushi\" MR-receive setup, assembled from two repurposed 18-channel body arrays, that allows TMS coil positioning while maintaining full-brain coverage. Resting-state (n = 12) and task-based working memory (n = 8) fMRI were acquired with the Sushi coil, a commercially available 2x7-channel Surface-coil setup, and a standard Siemens 64-channel (non-TMS-capable) head coil. The image-quality cost of TMS capability was addressed by acquiring multi-echo fMRI to allow post-hoc optimization of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but no TMS was delivered. Results: From resting-state fMRI, the Sushi mapped known canonical resting-state networks (RSNs) comparably to the 64-channel reference and was superior to the Surface coils, in particular for the default-mode, auditory, and visual networks. Task-fMRI data showed that Sushi recovered the working memory network more similarly to the 64-channel reference than the Surface coil. Temporal SNR was optimized for all coil acquisitions yielding ~30-50% gain and improving between-coil comparability for RSNs identification and task-related activity. Conclusions: Together, post-hoc multi-echo optimization and the Sushi coil setup provide a low-cost, ready-to-use solution for whole-brain concurrent TMS-fMRI recordings. Combining stimulation access with reliable functional network readouts is essential to probe mechanisms of TMS and to inform effective TMS interventions targeting altered brain systems.",

    "title": "Innovative approach of nonlinear controllers design for prosthetic knee performance",
    "content": "Prosthetic knee joints are essential assistive technologies designed to replicate natural gait and improve mobility for individuals with lower-limb loss. This study presents a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of a two-degree-of-freedom prosthetic knee joint and introduces three robust nonlinear control strategies: Integral Sliding Mode Control, Conditional Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control, and Conditional Adaptive Positive Semidefinite Barrier Function-based Sliding Mode Control. These controllers are designed to address the challenges associated with nonlinear joint dynamics, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties during locomotion. To optimize control performance, the gain parameters of each controller were fine-tuned using Red Fox Optimization, a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the intelligent hunting behavior of red foxes. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov theory, and control effectiveness is evaluated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and validated via hardware-in-the-loop testing using a C2000 Delfino F28379D microcontroller. Among the three controllers, the CoBA-based approach demonstrated the highest tracking accuracy, fastest convergence, and smoothest torque profile. The close agreement between simulation and experimental results confirms the practical applicability of the proposed control framework, offering a promising solution for intelligent and adaptive prosthetic knee systems.",

It uses libcst for AST transforms on common patterns (so no LLM needed for the straightforward stuff like .dict() \u2192 .model_dump()), and falls back to an LLM for trickier migrations. Right now it has a knowledge base of 15 popular packages including Pydantic, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Requests.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> Anyone who's put off upgrading a dependency because they didn't want to manually fix hundreds of breaking changes. I built this for my own projects but it should be useful for anyone dealing with major version migrations.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most tools just bump your version numbers (like pip-tools, poetry update) or tell you what's outdated. Codeshift actually modifies your source code to match the new API.

    "title": "Retries and circuit breakers as failure policies in Python",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Retries and circuit breakers are often treated as separate concerns with one library for retries (if not just spinning your own retry loops) and another for breakers. Each one with its own knobs and semantics.</p> <p>I've found that before deciding <em>how</em> to respond (retry, fail fast, trip a breaker), it's best to decide <em>what kind of failure occurred</em>. </p> <p>I've been working on a small Python library called <a href=\"https://github.com/aponysus/redress\">redress</a> that implements this idea by treating retries and circuit breakers as <strong>policy responses to classified failure</strong>, not separate mechanisms. </p> <p>Failures are mapped to a small set of semantic error classes (RATE_LIMIT, SERVER_ERROR, TRANSIENT, etc.). Policies then decide how to respond to each class in a bounded, observable way. </p> <p>Here's an example using a unified policy that includes both retry and circuit breaking (neither of which are necessary if the user just wants sensible defaults):</p> <pre><code>from redress import Policy, Retry, CircuitBreaker, ErrorClass, default_classifier from redress.strategies import decorrelated_jitter policy = Policy( retry=Retry( classifier=default_classifier, strategy=decorrelated_jitter(max_s=5.0), deadline_s=60.0, max_attempts=6, ), # Fail fast when the upstream is persistently unhealthy circuit_breaker=CircuitBreaker( failure_threshold=5, window_s=60.0, recovery_timeout_s=30.0, trip_on={ErrorClass.SERVER_ERROR, ErrorClass.CONCURRENCY}, ), ) result = policy.call(lambda: do_work(), operation=&quot;sync_op&quot;) </code></pre> <p>Retries and circuit breakers share the same classification, lifecycle, and observability hooks. When a policy stops retrying or trips a breaker, it does so far an explicit reason that can be surfaced directly to metrics and/or logs. </p> <p>The goal is to make failure handling explicit, bounded, and diagnosable.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This project is intended for production use in Python services where retry behavior needs to be controlled carefully under real failure conditions.</p> <p>It\u2019s most relevant for:</p> <ul> <li>backend or platform engineers</li> <li>services calling unreliable upstreams (HTTP APIs, databases, queues)</li> <li>teams that want retries and circuit breaking to be bounded and observable</li> <li>It\u2019s likely overkill if you just need a simple decorator with a fixed backoff.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most Python retry libraries focus on how to retry (decorators, backoff math), and treat all failures similarly or apply one global strategy.</p> <p>redress is different. It classifies failures first, before deciding how to respond, allows per-error-class retry strategies, treatsretries and circuit breakers as part of the same policy model, and emits structured lifecycle events so retry and breaker decisions are observable. </p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p>Project: <a href=\"https://github.com/aponysus/redress\">https://github.com/aponysus/redress</a></p> <p>Docs: <a href=\"https://aponysus.github.io/redress/\">https://aponysus.github.io/redress/</a></p> <p>I'm very interested in feedback if you've built or operated such systems in Python. If you've solved it differently or think this model has sharp edges, please let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/qiaoshiya\"> /u/qiaoshiya </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqh7yb/retries_and_circuit_breakers_as_failure_policies/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqh7yb/retries_and_circuit_breakers_as_failure_policies/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For the past 10 years I\u2019ve been a volunteer organizer of <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2026/attend/startup-row/\">Startup Row</a> at PyCon US, and I wanted to let all the entrepreneurs and early-stage startup employees know that applications for free booth space at PyCon US close at the end of this weekend. (The webpage says this Friday, but I can assure you that the web form will stay up through the weekend.)</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of information on the Startup Row page on the PyCon US website, and a post on the <a href=\"https://pycon.blogspot.com/2026/01/apply-for-pycon-startup-row-2026.html\">PyCon blog</a> if you\u2019re interested. But I figured I\u2019d summarize it all in the form of an FAQ.</p> <p><strong>What is Startup Row at PyCon US?</strong></p> <p>Since 2011 the Python Software Foundation and conference organizers have reserved booth space for early-stage startups at PyCon US. It is, in short, a row of booths for startups building cool things with Python. Companies can apply for booth space on Startup Row and recipients are selected through a competitive review process. The selection committee consists mostly of startup founders that have previously presented on Startup Row.</p> <p><strong>How to I apply?</strong></p> <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2026/applications/apply/startup-row/\">Submit your application here!</a>\u201d button at the bottom of the Startup Row page will take you to the application form.</p> <p>There are a half-dozen questions that you\u2019ve probably already answered if you\u2019ve applied to any sort of incubator, accelerator, or startup competition.</p> <p>You will need to create a PyCon US login first, but that takes only a minute.</p> <p><strong>Deadline?</strong></p> <p>Technically the webpage says applications close on Friday January 30th. The web form will remain active through this weekend.</p> <p>Our goal is to give companies a final decision on their application status by mid-February, which is plenty of time to book your travel and sort out logistics.</p> <p><strong>What does my company get if selected to be on Startup Row?</strong></p> <p>At no cost to them, Startup Row companies receive:</p> <ul> <li>Two included conference passes, with additional passes available for your team at a discount.</li> <li>Booth space in the Expo Hall on Startup Row for the Opening Reception on the evening of Thursday May 14th and for both days of the main conference, Friday May 15th and Saturday May 16th.</li> <li>Optionally: A table at the PyCon US Job Fair on Sunday May 17th. (If you\u2019re company is hiring Python talent, there is likely nowhere better than PyCon US for technical recruiting.)</li> <li>Placement on the PyCon US 2026 website and a profile on the PyCon US blog (where you\u2019re reading this post)</li> <li>Eternal glory</li> </ul> <p>Basically, getting a spot on Startup Row gives your company the same experience as a paying sponsor of PyCon at no cost. Teams are still responsible for flights, hotels, and whatever materials you bring for your booth.</p> <p><strong>What are the eligibility requirements?</strong></p> <p>Pretty simple:</p> <ul> <li>You have to use Python somewhere in your stack, the more the better.</li> <li>Company is less than 2.5 years old (either from founding or from public launch)</li> <li>Has 25 or fewer employees</li> <li>Has not already presented on Startup Row or sponsored PyCon US. (Founders who previously applied but weren\u2019t selected are welcome to apply again. Alumni founders working on new companies are also welcome to apply.)</li> </ul> <p>Apart from the &quot;use Python somewhere&quot; rule, all the other criteria are somewhat fuzzy. </p> <p><strong>If you have questions, please shoot me a DM or chat request.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jrowley\"> /u/jrowley </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqjbep/pycon_us_grants_free_booth_space_and_conference/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqjbep/pycon_us_grants_free_booth_space_and_conference/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Hill-Type Models of Skeletal Muscle and Neuromuscular Actuators: A Systematic Review",
    "content": "Backed by a century of research and development, Hill-type models of skeletal muscle, often including a muscle-tendon complex and neuromechanical interface, are widely used for countless applications. Lacking recent comprehensive reviews, the field of Hill-type modeling is, however, dense and hard-to-explore, with detrimental consequences on innovation. Here we present the first systematic review of Hill-type muscle modeling. It aims to clarify the literature by detailing its contents and critically discussing the state-of-the-art by identifying the latest advances, current gaps, and potential future directions in Hill-type modeling. For this purpose, fifty-eight criteria-abiding Hill-type models were assessed according to a completeness evaluation, which identified the modelled muscle properties, and a modeling evaluation, which considered the level of validation and reusability of the models, as well as their modeling strategy and calibration. It is concluded that most models (1) do not significantly advance beyond historical foundational standards, (2) neglect the importance of parameter identification, (3) lack robust validation, and (4) are not reusable in other studies. Besides providing a convenient tool supported by extensive supplementary materials for navigating the literature, the results of this review highlight the need for global recommendations in Hill-type modeling to optimize inter-study consistency, knowledge transfer, and model reusability.",

    "title": "Network Models of Neurodegeneration: Bridging Neuronal Dynamics and Disease Progression",
    "content": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and widespread disruptions in brain function. Computational modeling has advanced our understanding of these processes, but efforts have traditionally focused on either neuronal dynamics or the biological processes underlying disease. One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain frameworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network stability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease progression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, glial responses and vascular mechanisms. Each modeling tradition has provided important insights, but experimental evidence shows these processes are interconnected: neuronal activity modulates protein release and clearance, while pathological burden disrupts neuronal function. Modeling these domains in isolation limits our understanding, although recent studies have begun to bridge the two by coupling neuronal and pathological processes. To determine where and why disease emerges, how it spreads, and how it might be altered, mathematical models that capture feedback between neuronal dynamics and disease biology are needed. This review surveys the two modeling approaches and highlights efforts to unify them, emphasizing that linking neuronal activity and disease progression is key to identifying strategies that slow, halt, or reverse degeneration and restore neural function.",

    "title": "Principles and Operation of Virtual Brain Twins",
    "content": "Current clinical methods often overlook individual variability by relying on population-wide trials, while mechanism-based trials remain underutilized in neuroscience due to the brain\u2019s complexity. This situation may change through the use of a Virtual Brain Twin (VBT), which is a personalized digital replica of an individual\u2019s brain, integrating structural and functional brain data into advanced computational models and inference algorithms. By bridging the gap between molecular mechanisms, whole-brain dynamics, and imaging data, VBTs enhance the understanding of (patho)physiological mechanisms, advancing insights into both healthy and disordered brain function. Central to VBT is the network modeling that couples mesoscopic representation of neuronal activity through white matter connectivity, enabling the simulation of brain dynamics at a network level. This transformative approach provides interpretable predictive capabilities, supporting clinicians in personalizing treatments and optimizing interventions. This Review outlines the key components of VBT development, covering the conceptual, mathematical, technical, and clinical aspects. We describe the stages of VBT construction\u2013from anatomical coupling and modeling to simulation and Bayesian inference\u2013and demonstrate their applications in resting-state, healthy aging, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to other neurological disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, and explore future applications in consciousness research and brain-computer interfaces, paving the way for advancements in personalized medicine and brain-machine integration.",

    "title": "Emerging Noninvasive Approaches for the Suppression of Pathological Tremor",
    "content": "Pathological tremor affects over 40 million people worldwide, significantly impairing daily activities and quality of life. Pharmacological treatments show limited efficacy, with up to 30% discontinuation rates, while surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation achieve significant tremor reduction but are often unsuitable due to age, comorbidities, or personal preference. Recently, the need for safe and effective alternatives has led to the development of innovative, noninvasive, and patient-friendly technologies for tremor management. This clinical application review analyzed 134 studies (1969-2025), categorizing them into three major modalities, focusing on their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, with a special emphasis on the clinical perspective. The three considered modalities were force-controlling (orthoses and functional electrical stimulation), central neuromodulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, low-intensity focused ultrasound, and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation), and peripheral neuromodulation (afferent stimulation and vibration). Force-controlling strategies showed promising acute effects, though clinical translation remains limited by poor wearability and the development of muscle fatigue. Central neuromodulation produced moderate effects, while peripheral neuromodulation has gained clinical traction, with several devices now being commercially available. However, heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and technology maturity remain the main obstacles for the direct comparison of techniques. Future research should prioritize larger multicenter trials, standardized outcome measures, and accessibility considerations to enable personalized, evidence-based treatment selection for diverse tremor populations.",

    "title": "Assistive Trajectory Planning for Lower Limb Exoskeletons: Strategies From Laboratory-Optimized Gait to Environmentally-Adaptive Locomotion Through Multimodal Parameter Awareness",
    "content": "Lower limb assistive exoskeletons (LLEs) show great potential to reduce metabolic cost, improve walking performance, and correct abnormal gait patterns. Among their core control architectures, assistive trajectory planning is key to determining system responsiveness and effectiveness under varying locomotion conditions. Many trajectory planning methods were proposed in either laboratory or unstructured real-world environments. To clarify the scope and challenges of existing research, this review categorizes trajectory planning strategies into two major types based on application scenarios: (1) strategies for laboratory settings with controllable disturbances, which usually involve optimal control for gait under stable or controllable conditions; and (2) strategies for real-world environments characterized by varying terrain, individual differences, and gait fluctuations, which usually involve adaptive control for gait under diverse or unstructured conditions. Given the foundational role of gait phase detection in trajectory planning, this review also systematically examines mainstream algorithms for gait phase recognition and estimation. Finally, the paper analyzes the limitations of existing methods and discusses the potential of advanced algorithms, intelligent multimodal sensing systems, novel sensing technologies, and embedded deployment to enhance the performance of exoskeleton assistive trajectory planning.",

    "title": "Decoding Spikes From Multiunit Data",
    "content": "Communication and control in biological systems is mediated by the timing of discharges \u2013spikes\u2013 from excitable cells such as neurons and muscle fibers. Each spike is associated to a characteristic waveform that can be captured by sensors. The waveform's characteristics depend on the cell's biophysical properties and the recording modality. Depending on the technique, e.g., electrical recordings with electrodes, optical imaging, ultrasound, the observed signals are mixtures of waveforms emitted from active cells/sources (multiunit data/signals). Recovering the timing and identity of these sources (multiunit or spike decoding) is central to neuroscience, clinical diagnostics, and neural interfacing, yet it remains challenging due to waveform superposition, non-stationarity, limited training labels, and the computational demands of high-density recordings. This review provides a unified methodological perspective on spike decoding by formalizing the problem as a sparse source separation task under a convolutive mixing model. Rather than organizing the literature by application domain, we group and critically compare methods by their underlying principles: classical spike sorting, Bayesian and probabilistic inference, blind source separation, and data-driven approaches, including deep learning and hybrid schemes. For each class of methods, we present the core mathematical formulation and algorithmic strategies and discuss assumptions and limitations. Our synthesis highlights parallels in signal processing across physical recording modalities and clarifies when and why particular approaches succeed or fail. By bridging previously compartmentalized literature, this survey aims to accelerate crosspollination of ideas between application areas and to provide a roadmap for selecting, adapting, and advancing decoding methods across diverse multiunit recording modalities.",

    "content": "Neuroscientific investigations of human dreaming have been hampered by reliance on dream recall after awakening. For example, a challenge of associating EEG features with post-waking dream reports is that they are subject to distortion, forgetting, and poor temporal precision. In this study, we used real-time reporting to investigate whether one of the most robust features of the waking visual system, increased alpha oscillations upon closing one's eyes, also applies when people dream of closing their eyes. We studied 13 people, four with narcolepsy and nine without, who experienced many lucid dreams\u2014they were aware they were dreaming while remaining asleep. They reported on both their dream experiences (visual percepts present/absent) and dream-eyelid status (open/closed) using a novel communication technique; they produced distinctive sniffing patterns according to presleep instructions. We observed these signals in respiration recordings from a nasal cannula. These physiological signals enabled analyses of time-locked neural activity during REM sleep. We recorded 150 signals over 19 sessions from 11 individuals. Robust increases in alpha power were not found after signaled dream-eye closure. Remarkably, the experience of eye closure while dreaming was associated with fading visual content only about half the time. Comparing the presence versus absence of visual content was possible only in three participants, who showed increased alpha power in association with a momentary lack of visual content. Enlisting dreamers to actively control and report on ongoing dream experiences in this way thus opens new avenues for dynamic investigations of dreams\u2014the illusory perceptions that haunt our sleep.",

    "title": "The Neural Consequences of Semantic Composition",
    "content": "Humans can create completely new concepts through semantic composition. These \u201cconceptual combinations\u201d can be created by attributing the features of one concept to another (e.g., a \u201clemon flamingo\u201d might be a yellow flamingo) or drawing on a relationship between concepts (e.g., a \u201clemon flamingo\u201d might consume lemons). We ask how semantic composition modulates the neural representations of underlying concepts. Combining fMRI with multivariate pattern analysis, we interrogate neural patterns for concepts before and after they were subjected to semantic composition. We observe a postcomposition shift in neural patterns underlying weakly constrained concepts in the visual system. The composition of strongly constrained combinations draws on a network of semantic regions that include the right inferior frontal gyrus, left angular gyrus, left lateral anterior temporal lobe, and posterior cingulate cortex. Finally, a subset of the semantic network, in the left parahippocampal gyrus, distinguishes the manner of composition: relational or attributive. These findings reveal that semantic composition has neural consequences for the composed concepts and that the manner of composition affects how the brain's semantic network is deployed.",

    "title": "Hindering Memory Suppression by Perturbing the Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex",
    "content": "A reminder of the past can trigger the involuntary retrieval of an unwanted memory. Yet, we can intentionally stop this process and thus prevent the memory from entering awareness. Such suppression not only transiently hinders the retrieval of the memory, it can also induce forgetting. Neuroimaging has implicated the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in initiating this process. Specifically, this region seems to downregulate activity in brain systems that would otherwise support memory reinstatement. Here, we probed the causal contribution of the right dlPFC to suppression by combining the think/no-think task with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Participants first learned pairs of cue and target words and then repeatedly recalled some of the targets (think condition) and suppressed others (no-think condition). We applied 10-Hz rTMS bursts to the right dlPFC during the suppression of half the no-think items and to the contralateral primary motor area (M1) as an active control site during the other half. As hypothesized, participants experienced less success at keeping the memories out of awareness with concurrent dlPFC than M1 stimulation. Similarly, a memory test yielded evidence for suppression-induced forgetting (SIF) following M1 but not dlPFC stimulation. However, the difference in forgetting between the stimulation conditions was not significant. The study thus provides causal evidence for the role of the dlPFC in preventing retrieval. Future work will need to conclusively establish the relationship between this transient effect and SIF.",

    "title": "Neural Reinstatement of Encoding Context Mediates the Switch between Fear and Extinction Recall",
    "content": "Fear conditioning and extinction generate conflicting memory representations for a conditioned stimulus (CS). Retrieval of either memory is largely determined by the context where the CS is encountered. While fear typically generalizes to CSs encountered in new contexts, extinction is specific to the environment in which it was learned. Here, we used an fMRI design (n = 30, 16 women) to tag and track the extent to which individual participants reinstated competing episodic mental contexts associated with threat conditioning and extinction. We examined whether reactivation of past encoding contexts influences threat expectancy behavior and neural responses to a threat-ambiguous CS encountered in a new context. Results showed that the relative balance between conditioning and extinction context reinstatement in higher-order visual cortex influenced threat expectancy and neural activity in canonical threat processing regions. The link between context reinstatement and fear-related processes was specific to an extinguished CS, as opposed to an unextinguished CS that had never been encountered in the extinction context. These effects were observed 24 hr later, but not after 3 weeks. Additionally, threat conditioning produced long-lasting changes in primary sensory cortex that persisted up to 3 weeks following extinction. These findings show that neural representations of threat can endure over long durations, even in the healthy brain. Our results indicate competition between divergent mental contexts determines feelings of danger or safety when the meaning of the CS is ambiguous and suggest a mechanism by which the brain resolves ambiguity by reinstating the more dominant context associated with either fear or extinction.",

    "content": "Cognitive reappraisal and attentional distraction constitute two core strategies for regulating emotions. Prior studies have largely focused on young adults regulating simple laboratory stimuli, with few direct comparisons of brain regions that differentiate or mutually implement these strategies. Here, we expanded the typical age range of participants, compared reappraisal and distraction within participants, and used ecologically valid autobiographical memories as regulatory targets. Sixty-two healthy adults aged 35\u201375 years generated cue words for negative and neutral autobiographical memories and were trained to either reappraise, distract, or let their emotions flow naturally in response to cued memories. Strategy-specific contrasts were derived from whole-brain fMRI data using univariate analyses. For reappraisal, relative to flow, we observed activity in bilateral occipital cortex, right cerebellum, and cingulate cortex and primarily left-sided frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Distraction, relative to flow, engaged bilateral lateral prefrontal, medial parietal, cingulate, occipital, and retrosplenial regions and left cerebellum. Common areas of activation included midline occipital and posterior cingulate cortices. Direct comparisons yielded strategy differences across multiple cortical areas: distraction engaged paralimbic areas (insula and left parahippocampal gyrus), dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC, and right inferior frontoparietal cortex, whereas reappraisal engaged dorsomedial PFC, left ventrolateral PFC, anterior temporal cortex, and left posterolateral PFC. In-scanner valence ratings verified the efficacy of the experimental manipulation and revealed a negative impact of age on reappraisal success, which was correlated with greater visual cortical processing. These findings extend knowledge regarding the neural mechanisms of emotion regulation across the adult lifespan for autobiographical events.",

    "content": "Oscillatory power across multiple frequency bands has been associated with distinct working memory (WM) processes. Recent research has shown that previous observations based on averaged power are driven by the presence of transient, oscillatory burst-like events, particularly within the alpha, beta, and gamma bands. However, the interplay between different burst events in human WM is not well understood. The current EEG study aimed to investigate the dynamics between alpha (8\u201312 Hz)/beta (15\u201329 Hz) and high-frequency activity (HFA; 55\u201380 Hz) bursts in human WM, particularly burst features and error-related deviations during the encoding and maintenance of WM in healthy adults. Oscillatory burst features within the alpha, beta, and HFA bands were examined at frontal and parietal electrodes in healthy young adults during a Sternberg WM task. Averaged power dynamics were driven by oscillatory burst features, most consistently the burst rate and burst power. Alpha/beta and HFA bursts displayed complementary roles in WM processes, in that alpha and beta bursting decreased during encoding and increased during delay, while HFA bursting had the opposite pattern, that is, increased during encoding and decreased during the delay. Critically, weaker variation in burst dynamics across stages was associated with incorrect responses and impaired overall task performance. Together, these results indicate that successful human WM is dependent on the rise-and-fall interplay between alpha/beta and HFA bursts, with such burst dynamics reflecting a novel target for the development of treatment in clinical populations with WM deficits.",

A shared mechanism that may underlie these performance limits is how the visual system parses a scene into representational units. In the present study, we explored whether multiple-object tracking (MOT) and WM rely on a common item-based indexing mechanism. We measured the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an event-related slow wave that tracks load in an item-based manner, as participants completed a combined WM and MOT task, concurrently tracking items and remembering visual information. In Experiment 1, participants tracked one or two moving discs without needing to remember the discs' colors (track and ignore condition) or while also remembering the discs' colors (two or four colors in total; track and remember condition). In Experiment 2, participants attended either two static discs or two moving discs, while remembering the discs' colors (two or four colors). In both experiments, the CDA was largely determined by the tracking task\u2014CDA amplitudes reflected the number of tracked discs and not the number of to-be-remembered colors. However, when the discs were static, the CDA amplitudes did reflect color load. We discuss this set of findings in relation to longstanding theories of visual cognition (fingers of instantiation and object files) and the implications for cognitive models of representation of visual information\u2014that how a scene is parsed into item-based representations is a key mechanism in the operation of WM.",

    "content": "There has been much debate about whether salient stimuli have an automatic power to distract us, with many conflicting results. The attentional window account proposes a potential resolution by suggesting that capture depends on the breadth of attentional focus. According to this account, when attention is broadly focused, salient stimuli will fall inside the attentional window and generate a salience signal that captures attention. When attention is narrowly focused, salient stimuli presented outside the window of attention cannot generate a salience signal that attracts attention. If true, this could explain many otherwise-contradictory findings, but this account has not been widely tested. The present study used a shape discrimination task to manipulate the spread of spatial attention and tested whether salient distractors inside versus outside the attended region capture attention. Attentional capture was assessed by the N2pc component and behavioral measures. Contrary to the predictions of the attentional window account, we found no evidence that capture by salient distractors depended on whether the salient distractor was inside or outside the attended window. Instead, our findings support models of attention that allow feature-based control mechanisms to prevent capture by salient distractors.",

    "title": "Experience-dependent Changes in the Visual Processing of Letters: Evidence from Electroencephalography Decoding",
    "content": "Learning to read involves the formation and tuning of letter representations, but it is unknown whether this orthographic tuning influences very early visual processing or only later processing. This study tested the hypothesis that experience increases the extraction of sensory information about letters by comparing the EEG activity elicited by upright and inverted letters. In a set of conventional univariate analyses, we found that inverted letters elicited larger P1 amplitudes (starting ca. 110 msec) and larger N170 amplitudes (starting ca. 160 msec) compared with upright letters. These larger amplitudes could reflect enhanced processing, but they might instead reflect degraded processing. We therefore performed multivariate pattern classification (decoding) to assess the amount of information about letter identity in the neural signal. Specifically, we decoded which individual letter was presented from the pattern of voltage across the scalp at each time point. We found that decoding accuracy was greater for upright letters than for inverted letters during the P1 latency range (starting ca. 90 msec), particularly in electrodes over the left hemisphere. This provides evidence for enhanced tuning for upright letters in early visual processing. By contrast, we found higher decoding accuracy for inverted letters than for upright letters during and after the N170 component (starting ca. 140 msec). These results demonstrate that massive experience with upright letters influences sensory processing, leading to enhanced feature extraction for highly familiar (upright) letter forms at an early stage, followed by enhanced neural discriminability for less familiar (inverted) letter forms at a later stage.",

    "content": "The human visual system readily processes illusory faces (IFs) as faces, a phenomenon known as face pareidolia. Building on evidence that IF processing elicits face-like neural activity and is sensitive to contextual cues, we investigated, via two experiments, whether and how the presence of human faces as a visual context to IFs influences IF categorization. In Experiment 1, we exploited the frequency-tagging approach in EEG to display IFs within rapid sequences of various object categories, interleaved with either human faces (face context, FC) or houses (nonface context, NC). The IF-selective neural response was significantly weaker and less face-like in FC compared to NC, with different topographical and temporal patterns. In Experiment 2, another group of participants performed an explicit IF detection task and exhibited slower RTs and lower detection accuracy in FC than in NC, consistent with the neural findings from Experiment 1. These results suggest that, rather than facilitating IF categorization, the presence of human faces interferes with IF categorization, likely because they compete for the same face-selective resources. Overall, this research highlights the critical role of context in shaping visual categorization by demonstrating earnestly how the visual environment dynamically influences the neural and perceptual processing of ambiguous stimuli.",

    "title": "Oscillatory traveling waves during visual entrainment in autistic and neurotypical adults",
    "content": "Neural oscillations play a crucial role in cognition, and several studies emphasize the importance of considering them as traveling waves that propagate through brain regions. In scalp EEG, waves typically travel along the anterior posterior axis: forward waves (occipital to frontal) predominate during sensory stimulation, while backward waves (frontal-to-occipital) emerge during rest and top down modulation. Within the predictive coding framework, backward waves are proposed to convey predictive signals, whereas forward waves reflect sensory processes and feedforward propagation of prediction errors. In this study, we investigated traveling wave dynamics during a visual entrainment task in neurotypical (N=25) and autistic (Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD) adults (N=24). Our results replicated previous findings in neurotypical participants, as we observed an increase in backward waves during rhythmic visual stimulation, consistent with enhanced top-down predictions. Notably, we observed the opposite pattern in the ASD group, characterized by a pronounced increase in forward waves at the entrained frequency during visual stimulation. These results align with predictive coding accounts of autistic perception, which hypothesize an imbalance between predictions and sensory evidence. Specifically, an increase in forward wave may reflect a bias toward bottom up sensory signaling over predictive feedback, due to atypical hierarchical communication across brain regions in ASD. Together, our findings shed new light on the oscillatory dynamics involved in visual entrainment in neurotypical adults and provide novel evidence in favor of predictive coding accounts of autistic perception, as well as a consequent bias toward bottom up sensory signaling over predictive feedback in a context of visual entrainment.",

However, it is unknown if the metabolic architecture of the brain displays similar gradient characteristics. Here, we use functional positron emission tomography (fPET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to characterise the metabolic connectivity gradients of the brain and determine how neurobiological mechanisms shape these gradients to support cognition across the adult lifespan. We identified four principal metabolic connectivity gradients, with the primary axis recapitulating the canonical unimodal-to-transmodal hierarchy from other imaging modalities. Subsequent gradients delineated specialised dimensions of metabolic organisation, including association system differentiation, hemispheric asymmetry, and sensory system segregation. These gradients were coupled to cortical thickness, baseline rates of glucose metabolism, blood flow, and gene expression related to energy metabolism, such that transmodal, control and default mode poles were more metabolically active, more interconnected, had greater cortical thickness, and were more strongly related to the expression of genes related to cellular energy production, than unimodal and sensory poles. A reduction in gradient strength at the gradient poles was associated with older age and predicted worse cognitive performance. We conclude that the metabolic organisation of the brain constitutes a genetically grounded, structurally and energetically constrained gradient hierarchy that supports cognitive function and undergoes a reorganisation in ageing.",

We developed a HaloTag-4R-Tau sensor in human iPSC-derived neurons (iNeurons) that enables sensitive monitoring the kinetics of both lysosomal partitioning and overall cellular turnover of tau. Using this sensor, we screened a small collection of small-molecule modulators of proteostasis network function and identified Neddylation inhibition by Pevonedistat as a robust promoter of soluble tau degradation. Mechanistic analysis including proteomic profiling revealed that Neddylation inhibition hastens HaloTag-Tau clearance via compensatory activation of a proteasome-dependent pathway(s) as well as the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Our findings establish a powerful tool for probing tau homeostasis and highlight Neddylation inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for enhancing both proteasome and lysosome-mediated tau clearance in tauopathies.",

Beyond recognition, the brain organizes visual stimuli into meaningful categories, supporting efficient perception and adaptive behavior. Previous studies in the human temporal lobe have identified concept cells supporting invariant representations of specific stimuli. However, invariant coding alone cannot account for how categorical knowledge is structured across related visual domains. Here, we analyzed single-neuron recordings from the human amygdala during the presentation of familiar visual stimuli spanning multiple categories. Using a novel data-driven analytic framework that integrates supervised population decoding with single-neuron analyses, we identified a population of cross-category invariant neurons. These neurons preserved exemplar-invariant responses while generalizing across multiple categories linked by shared naturalistic or human/domestic contexts. Our findings demonstrate that the human amygdala supports both invariant and associative forms of categorical representations. By linking stable identity representations across contextually related categories, the amygdala provides a flexible neural substrate for high-level visual organization, supporting efficient perception and adaptive behavior in complex environments.",

In this study, forty-five people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) and twenty age-matched healthy controls (HCs) completed a handwriting task and a control detection task (CDT) assessing the ability to distinguish self-generated from externally generated movements. PwP were classified based on handwriting metrics as showing no micrographia, CM, and/or PM. CDT accuracy was significantly lower in PwP than in HCs (p < 0.01) and was particularly reduced in PwP with PM (p < 0.01).

    "title": "Light-inducible proximity labelling in vivo captures sex-specific RNA at excitatory synapses",
    "content": "Local RNA regulation is essential for synaptic plasticity, yet the full repertoire of RNA species and associated isoforms within specific synaptic compartments in vivo has yet to be determined. Existing RNA profiling approaches lack the spatial and temporal precision needed to resolve RNA repertoires restricted to cell-type specific synaptic compartments. To overcome this challenge, we developed PSD95 Haloseq, a light induced proximity labelling technique that, when combined with long read sequencing, selectively captures all post-synaptic full length RNA species in the excitatory post synaptic compartment. Here, we applied this approach to investigate sex differences in RNA expression within excitatory synapses following exposure to an associative fear learning task in C57/Bl6 mice. We found dramatic sex differences in pseudogene and protein coding RNA expression, which are most abundant in females, with males exhibiting multiple noncoding RNA classes, including lncRNA, snoRNA, and rRNA. Females generally showed more 3' UTR expression, and there was widespread differential exon usage following fear conditioning, including 179 isoforms in males, 69 in females, with no significant gene level differential expression, indicating that behavioural state modifies sex specific isoform usage rather than overall transcript abundance. Our discovery that synaptic RNA composition is dynamic, sexually dimorphic, and profoundly shaped by experience, offers new insight into previously inaccessible mechanisms underlying sex differences in fear-related learning and memory. PSD95 Halo seq is therefore a powerful method for the precise spatiotemporal identification of compartment- and cell type specific RNA.",

    "title": "Chondroitin 4-sulphate depletion enhances synaptic plasticity and memory in aging",
    "content": "Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialised extracellular matrix structures enriched in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs), are key regulators of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Aging is characterised by a shift in chondroitin sulphate composition toward increased chondroitin-4-sulfation (C4S) and reduced C6S, a pattern associated with declining cognitive flexibility. Here, we investigated how selective reduction of C4S affects PNN structure, PV-interneuron connectivity, and cognitive performance across the lifespan. Conditional deletion of the C4-sulfotransferase Chst11 markedly reduced C4S levels and diminished dendritic PNN complexity while preserving somatic PNN structure. This partial destabilisation of PNNs increased excitatory synaptic input onto PV interneurons in both young and aged mice, without major alterations in basal hippocampal transmission or long-term potentiation. Behaviourally, Chst11 knockout mice showed robust and persistent protection against age-related cognitive decline. Working memory performance remained stable across aging, short-term spatial memory was enhanced from early adulthood onward, and object recognition memory was significantly prolonged at all retention delays, even in old age. Sociability and social novelty preference were also preserved longer in aging knockouts compared with controls. These improvements occurred despite an overall preservation of PNN architecture, indicating that modifying sulphation rather than removing CSPGs is sufficient to enhance plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that reducing C4S through Chst11 deletion confers long-lasting enhancements in cognitive function and mitigates aging-related decline. Targeting CS-GAG sulphation patterns may therefore represent a promising strategy for maintaining cognitive resilience and restoring plasticity in aging or neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "title": "Diurnality reconfigures circadian network dynamics in the suprachiasmatic nucleus",
    "content": "Diurnal and nocturnal mammals occupy opposite temporal niches, but whether the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, follows the same intrinsic rules for timing adjustment and network coordination across species is unknown. Because SCN clock gene rhythms and population-level activity measurements look broadly similar across species, the prevailing interpretation in comparative studies has been that temporal niche differences are implemented upstream or downstream of the SCN. However, these coarse readouts do not test how clock resetting depends on circadian phase or how neuronal timing is coordinated across SCN space. Here, we combined long-duration ex vivo SCN recordings with optogenetic stimulation to compare SCN network dynamics in the nocturnal mouse (Mus musculus) and the diurnal four-striped grass mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio). Rhabdomys SCN molecular clock rhythms exhibited a longer intrinsic period and, under the same daily stimulation protocol, converged on a larger absolute phase angle relative to the stimulus. Molecular clock phase response curves differed in overall structure across circadian time between species, including pronounced early subjective day delays in Rhabdomys when Mus responses were minimal. Phase mapping of single-cell SCN calcium rhythms revealed species-specific spatial timing organization, with a graded dorsomedial-to-ventrolateral phase progression in Rhabdomys and a sharper transition in Mus. The Mus and Rhabdomys SCN can thus appear similar by coarse readouts yet diverge in phase-dependent molecular clock resetting and network timing organization. These results indicate that models placing temporal niche divergence solely outside the SCN are mechanistically incomplete.",

    "title": "Divergent Electrophysiological Responses in the Human Hippocampus During Verbal Memory Processing",
    "content": "The profile of electrophysiological responses in the human hippocampus (HPC) during verbal memory processing has remained complex and unclear. Here, we studied 26 patients implanted with intracranial electrodes across 187 HPC sites (50% left, 2-18 per patient). During memory encoding and retrieval, a subset of HPC responsive sites demonstrated increased ripple events, along with elevated high-frequency (HFA >50 Hz), and low-frequency (LFA 1-8 Hz) activity. A nearly equal number of sites showed no changes in ripple rate but increased LFA power and a delayed response-locked decrease in HFA power. More importantly, both successful encoding as well as recognition of remembered words were strongly associated with the coordination of the timing of LFA and HFA increases across the two clusters of responsive HPC sites. Using direct cortical electrical stimulations, we confirmed overlapping, but partially distinct, cortical connections to the functionally distinct HPC clusters. Our findings suggest a mesoscale mosaic functional organization within the human HPC where adjacent sites with divergent electrophysiological responses may have specialized roles during verbal memory processing. More importantly, our findings suggest that successful human memory depends on the coordination of the timing of low and high frequency local fields generated across these functionally divergent neuronal population sites.",

    "title": "LSD Reconfigures Cortical Dynamics Through Faster Brain Rhythms and Increased Fractal Dimension",
    "content": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) profoundly alters conscious experience, yet the electrophysiological mechanisms by which it reshapes neural dynamics remain incompletely understood. A hallmark of psychedelic states is widespread cortical desynchronization, typically inferred from reductions in spectral power, but whether such effects reflect genuine weakening of neural oscillations or are confounded by shifts in oscillatory peak frequencies remains unresolved. Here, we address this gap by combining source-resolved magnetoencephalography (MEG), spectral parameterization, temporal complexity metrics, and interpretable machine learning in an LSD versus placebo design, with and without music. We show that LSD induces robust, spatially structured increases in alpha and beta peak frequencies alongside genuine attenuation of oscillatory power, with these effects displaying partly dissociable cortical patterns. Beyond rhythmic activity, LSD is associated with flattening of the aperiodic 1/f spectral slope and increased neural signal complexity and fractality, preferentially affecting sensory, language, emotion, and imagery-related networks while sparing motor cortex. Machine-learning analyses further identify peak-frequency shifts, aperiodic parameters, and complexity measures as key discriminators of the psychedelic state. Music does not robustly amplify these neural signatures and instead shows a trend toward attenuation. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive electrophysiological account of how LSD reorganizes large-scale human brain dynamics and highlight features that may differentiate its neural signature from that of other psychedelics.",

    "title": "Individual Dynamics in Stress-Related Pain Responses",
    "content": "Background: Stress and pain are two adaptive mechanisms, driving human behavior and cognition. They are bidirectionally related, and modulating factors such as sleep or physical activity were identified. However, how stable individual differences in pain-related distress, including individual dispositions for pain catastrophizing, and person-specific pain sensitivities relate to the strength of stress responses remains unclear. This preregistered study closes this gap by investigating how trait pain-related distress and pain sensitivity changes relate to individuals stress response. Methods: Trait pain-related distress was assessed in 148 healthy males with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, and the Fear of Pain Questionnaire. Baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, alpha-amylase, and cortisol were obtained as well as initial heat pain thresholds and tolerances. One participant group underwent the Maastricht Acute Stress Task, while a control group performed the placebo version of this task, and consecutively all stress- and experimental pain indicators were examined again. Results: Individuals with lower kinesiophobia demonstrated higher stress-induced increases in alpha-amylase. Furthermore, stress-induced changes in pain sensitivity showed high individual variability, but were not associated with the stress response. Finally, in individuals with a higher tendency to catastrophize and to fear pain, stronger alpha-amylase increases were associated with larger post-stressor increases in pain threshold, indicating reduced pain sensitivity. Conclusion: Our study suggests that stable individual differences influence the stress-pain link beyond physiology. This underscores the importance of considering trait differences in future research on stress-pain interactions with the goal of better tailoring preventions and treatments for patients with chronic pain.",

    "content": "Mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction are central features of Parkinson's disease (PD) across major genetic forms including PRKN, SNCA, and LRRK2. We applied cell morphomics, a machine-learning-based framework combining high-content imaging with quantitative feature extraction, to analyse mitochondrial and lysosomal morphology at single-cell resolution in iPS cell-derived cortical neurons from PD patients and healthy controls (13 lines total). Supervised machine-learning models distinguished PD neurons from controls with high accuracy (AUC = 0.87) and reliably separated individual genotypes. Feature importance and attribution analysis revealed genotype-specific organelle biases, with mitochondrial features dominating classification in PRKN neurons, balanced mitochondrial and lysosomal contributions in SNCA neurons, and a greater lysosomal contribution in LRRK2 neurons. Multi-class models retained strong performance, and findings were reproduced across two independent laboratories using different dyes and imaging conditions. These results demonstrate that morphomics provides a robust and scalable framework to quantify genotype-specific organelle abnormalities in PD neurons and supports its application for cellular stratification and biomarker discovery.",

    "title": "Proactive visual and motor prioritization differentially scale with cue reliability",
    "content": "Environmental cues enable the brain to anticipate and prepare for upcoming behavior, such as by selectively prioritizing relevant visual representations and associated action plans in working memory in service of an imminent task. While it has been demonstrated that neural dynamics of visual and motor prioritization each scale with cue reliability, studies to date tracked either visual or motor prioritization in isolation. It therefore remains unknown whether visual and motor prioritization scale similarly or differently with cue reliability. To fill this gap, we manipulated cue reliability (100%, 80%, 60%) in a visual-motor working-memory task that uniquely enabled us to isolate the neural dynamics associated with visual and motor prioritization in anticipation of an imminent working-memory task. EEG measurements in male and female human volunteers revealed how cue reliability differentially drives visual and motor prioritization. While the strength and timing of visual prioritization were largely invariant to cue reliability, motor prioritization profoundly scaled with cue reliability and developed more gradually with lower certainty. These findings show that visual and motor prioritization in working memory are differentially susceptible to the certainty conveyed by environmental cues, and suggest that motor prioritization may be more cautious in nature.",

    "title": "Rethinking the IDE: Moving from text files to a graph-based IDE",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>V\u2011NOC(Virtual Node Code) is a graph\u2011based IDE that sits on top of your existing files. Instead of treating code as a long list of text files, it treats the codebase like a map that you can navigate, zoom into, and filter based on what you are working on.</p> <p>The source code stays exactly the same. The graph is an additional structural layer used only for understanding, navigation, debugging, and tooling.</p> <p>The main idea is to reduce the mental effort required to understand large or unfamiliar codebases for both humans and LLMs by making structure explicit and persistent.</p> <h1>The Problem It Tries to Solve</h1> <p>Modern development is built almost entirely around files. Files are not real structures \u2014 they are flat text. They only make sense when a human or an LLM reads them and reconstructs the logic in their head.</p> <p>Because of this, code, logs, and documentation are disorganized by default. There is no real connection being tracked between them.</p> <p>This forces a bottom\u2011up way of working. To understand or change one small thing, you often need to understand many other parts first. You start from low\u2011level details and slowly work your way up, even when your goal is high\u2011level.</p> <p>In practice, this means humans are doing a computer\u2019s job. We repeatedly read files, trace function calls, and rebuild a mental model of the system in our heads. That model is fragile and temporary it disappears when we switch tasks or move to another part of the codebase.</p> <p>As the codebase grows, this problem grows much faster than the code itself. More files, more functions, and more connections create chaos. The number of relationships you need to remember increases rapidly, and the mental energy required to keep everything straight becomes overwhelming. Current file-based systems mix concerns and force you to load unrelated context just to understand one small change.</p> <p>Instead of spending energy on reasoning or design, developers spend it on remembering where things are and how they connect work the computer could track automatically.</p> <h1>How V\u2011NOC Works (High Level)</h1> <h1>Graph\u2011Based Structure</h1> <p>V\u2011NOC builds a graph\u2011based structure on top of your existing files. The physical folder and file hierarchy is converted into a graph, using the existing structure as the top level so it still feels familiar.</p> <p>Every file and folder is assigned a stable ID. Its identity stays the same even if it is renamed or moved. This allows notes, documentation, logs, and history to stay attached to the logic itself instead of breaking when paths change.</p> <h1>Deep Logic Extraction (Static and Dynamic Analysis)</h1> <p>V\u2011NOC goes deeper than files. Using static analysis, every function and class is extracted and treated as a first\u2011class node in the graph.</p> <p>Dynamic analysis is then used to understand how the code actually runs. By combining both, V\u2011NOC builds accurate call graphs and full call chains for each function.</p> <p>This makes it possible to focus only on the functions involved in a specific flow. V\u2011NOC can slice those functions out of their original files and present them together in a single, focused view.</p> <p>Only the functions that participate in the selected call chain are shown. Everything else \u2014 unrelated functions, files, and boilerplate is temporarily hidden. Instead of manually tracing code and rebuilding a mental model, the structure is already there and reflects how the system works in the real world.</p> <h1>Semantic Grouping (Reducing Noise)</h1> <p>Large projects naturally create visual and cognitive noise. To manage this, V\u2011NOC allows semantic grouping.</p> <p>Related nodes can be grouped into virtual categories. For example, if a class contains many functions, the create, update, and delete logic can be grouped into a single node like \u201cCRUD.\u201d</p> <p>These groups are completely non\u2011destructive. They don\u2019t change the source code, file layout, or imports. They only change how the system is viewed, allowing you to work at a higher level and zoom into details only when needed.</p> <h1>Integrated Context (Logs and Documentation)</h1> <p>Because every function has a stable ID, documentation and logs can be attached directly to the function node.</p> <p>Logs are no longer a disconnected stream of text in a separate file. They live where they were produced. When an error occurs, you can see the exact function where it happened, the documentation for that function, and the visual call chain that led to the failure all in one place.</p> <p>Debugging becomes more direct and less about searching.</p> <h1>Context Control and Scaling</h1> <p>One of the core goals of V\u2011NOC is context control.</p> <p>As the codebase grows, the amount of context you need does not grow with it. You can view a single function as if it were the entire project, with everything outside its call graph hidden automatically.</p> <p>This keeps mental load roughly the same whether the project has 10 files or 10,000. The computer keeps track of the complexity so humans don\u2019t have to.</p> <h1>Benefits for LLMs</h1> <p>This structure is especially useful for LLMs.</p> <p>Today, LLMs are fed large amounts of raw text, which wastes tokens on irrelevant files and forces the model to reconstruct structure on its own. In a graph\u2011based system, an LLM can query only the exact neighborhood of a function.</p> <p>It can receive the specific function, its call graph, related documentation, and relevant runtime logs without loading the rest of the codebase. This removes wasted context and allows the model to focus on reasoning instead of structure discovery.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>V\u2011NOC is currently a working prototype. It mostly works as intended, but it is not production\u2011ready yet and still needs improvements in performance and some refinement in the UI and workflow.</p> <p>The project is intended for:</p> <ul> <li>All developers, especially those working with large or long\u2011lived codebases</li> <li>Developers who need to understand, explore, or learn unfamiliar codebases quickly</li> <li>Teams onboarding new contributors to complex systems</li> <li>Anyone interested in alternative IDE concepts and developer\u2011experience tooling</li> <li>LLM\u2011based tools and agents that need structured, precise access to code instead of raw text</li> </ul> <p>The goal is to make complex systems easier to understand and reason about whether the \u201cuser\u201d is a human developer or an AI agent.</p> <h1>Comparison to Existing Tools</h1> <p>Traditional IDEs and editors are primarily file\u2011centric. Understanding a system usually depends on search, jumping between files, and manually tracing logic. The structure of the code exists, but it has to be rebuilt mentally each time by the developer or the tool.</p> <p>V\u2011NOC takes a different approach by making structure the primary interface. Instead of starting from files, it provides a persistent and queryable representation of how the code is actually organized and how it behaves at runtime. The goal is not to replace text editing, but to add a structural layer that makes relationships explicit and always available.</p> <p>Some newer tools focus on chat\u2011based or agent\u2011driven interfaces that try to hide complexity from the user. While this can feel clean and convenient at first, it often works by summarizing or abstracting away important details. Over time, that hidden complexity still exists \u2014 it just becomes harder to see, verify, or reason about. It\u2019s similar to cleaning a room by pushing everything under the bed: things look neat initially, but the mess doesn\u2019t go away and eventually becomes harder to deal with.</p> <p>V\u2011NOC takes the opposite approach. It does not hide complexity; instead it make complex codebases easy to verify, It structures code so context can be controlled: you can work at a high level to understand overall flows, then move down to exact functions and call paths when you need details, without losing focus or trust in what you\u2019re seeing. The same underlying structure is used at every level, which allows both humans and LLMs to inspect real relationships directly, confirm assumptions against the actual code, and update understanding incrementally without pulling in unrelated context as the system grows.<br /> Rather than removing complexity from view, V\u2011NOC aims to make complexity navigable, so both humans and LLMs can work with real systems confidently as they grow.</p> <h1>Project Links</h1> <ul> <li>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/v-noc/IDE\">https://github.com/v-noc/IDE</a></li> <li>Hosted example using a real\u2011world codebase: <a href=\"https://vnoc.vercel.app/project/2dd75e19-5c7b-4fd1-b272-44a1c94dd8eb\">https://vnoc.vercel.app/project/2dd75e19-5c7b-4fd1-b272-44a1c94dd8eb</a></li> <li>Short demo videos: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g_fqTHdC3IRV_CcwuvixTYDHjrXPIfCS/view\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g_fqTHdC3IRV_CcwuvixTYDHjrXPIfCS/view</a> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ouNPtowRVKH7bwFby6VeQ59o_29z4uNW/view\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ouNPtowRVKH7bwFby6VeQ59o_29z4uNW/view</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/yared12qw\"> /u/yared12qw </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqj5vd/rethinking_the_ide_moving_from_text_files_to_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqj5vd/rethinking_the_ide_moving_from_text_files_to_a/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains a leading cause of disability worldwide, and effective treatments are urgently needed beyond reperfusion therapy. Translating preclinical success to clinical impact has been hindered by variability in animal models and the lack of translational biomarkers that predict outcomes across species. To overcome these barriers, we developed a robust rat AIS model optimized for consistency and severity, enabling rigorous therapeutic testing. Additionally, we tested a panel of common clinical serum biomarkers to improve translation from rodents to humans. We demonstrated that serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) -a biomarker widely used in clinical stroke studies- strongly correlated with functional outcomes, establishing a translational link that has not been previously reported in rats. Notably, the predictive capability of NfL outperformed infarct volume, a key prognostic factor in moderate and severe strokes, as well as traditional serum biomarkers intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and S100 calcium binding protein (S100B). Using this platform, we evaluated the therapeutic impact of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC EVs), a novel biologic therapy poised for clinical trials, on stroke outcome in our rat AIS model. A three-dose regimen of NSC EV over 48 hours produced the best outcomes in stroked animals evidenced by smaller infarct volume, improved neurologic score, and reduced serum NfL, although single-dose and two-dose regimens were both effective at some endpoints. These findings not only validate NfL as a cross-species biomarker but also provide critical dosing insights for NSC EV therapy, accelerating the path from bench to bedside for AIS treatment.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>pip-weigh is a command-line tool that tells you exactly how much disk space a Python package and all its dependencies will consume before you install it. I was working with some agentic frameworks and realized that most of them felt too bloated, and i thought i might compare them but when i searched online for a tool to do this, i realized that there is no such tool atm for this. There are some tools that actually check the size of the package itself but they dont calculate the size of dependencies that come with installing those packages. So i made a cli tool for this. Under the hood, it creates a temporary virtual environment using uv, installs the target package, parses the uv.lock file to get the full dependency tree, then calculates the actual size of each package by reading the .dist-info/RECORD files. This gives you the real &quot;logical size&quot; - what you'd actually see in a Docker image. <strong>Example output:</strong> ``` $ pip-weigh pandas \ud83d\udce6 pandas (2.1.4) \u251c\u2500\u2500 Total Size: 138 MB \u251c\u2500\u2500 Self Size: 45 MB \u251c\u2500\u2500 Platform: linux \u251c\u2500\u2500 Python: 3.12 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dependencies (5): \u251c\u2500\u2500 numpy (1.26.2): 85 MB \u251c\u2500\u2500 pytz (2023.3): 5 MB \u251c\u2500\u2500 python-dateutil (2.8.2): 3 MB \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...</p> <p>``<code> **Features:** - Budget checking:</code>pip-weigh pandas --budget 100MB<code>exits with code 1 if exceeded (useful for CI) - JSON output for scripting - Cross-platform: check Linux package sizes from Windows/Mac **Installation:**</code>pip install pip-weigh` (requires uv) <strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/muddassir-lateef/pip-weigh\">https://github.com/muddassir-lateef/pip-weigh</a></p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Developers who need to optimize Python deployments - particularly useful for: - Docker image optimization - AWS Lambda (250MB limit) - CI/CD pipelines to prevent dependency bloat It's a small side project but fully functional and published on PyPI.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>Existing tools only show size of the packages and don't calculate total sizes with dependencies. There's no easy way to check &quot;how big will this be?&quot;. pip-weigh differs by: - Calculating <strong>total size including all transitive dependencies</strong> - Using logical file sizes (what Docker sees) instead of disk usage (which can be misleading due to uv's hardlinks) I'd love feedback or suggestions for features. I am thinking of adding a <code>--compare</code> flag to show size differences between package versions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Character-Being2523\"> /u/Character-Being2523 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpxwk1/pipweigh_a_cli_tool_to_check_the_disk_size_of/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpxwk1/pipweigh_a_cli_tool_to_check_the_disk_size_of/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Circuit-Specific Resting-State fMRI Signatures for Stratifying First-Episode Major Depressive Disorder and Predicting Recurrence Risk",
    "content": "Background: Depression is biologically heterogeneous, and first-episode depression (FED) carries a high risk of recurrence that is poorly captured by symptom-based assessment. Early identification of patients likely to relapse, as well as reliable identification of those unlikely to relapse, is needed to support personalized intervention and efficient allocation of care. Methods: We developed a neurocomputational framework to infer recurrence risk from resting-state fMRI functional connectivity. The framework combines a Convolutional Filtering Autoencoder (CFAE) with a k-medoids clustering algorithm (FED-kMC) to derive neurofunctional FED subtypes, followed by a Manifold Sheaves-based Ensemble Support Vector Machine (MST-LVSVM) to estimate individual-level recurrence risk and define an interpretable decision boundary. Circuit-level analyses were then used to localize connectivity pathways associated with high relapse risk. Results: The framework identified two neurofunctionally distinct FED subtypes with divergent recurrence trajectories and achieved an external validation accuracy of 82.61% for recurrence risk prediction. Circuit analyses highlighted dysfunction within the Medial Superior Frontal Gyrus--Hippocampus and Angular Gyrus--Precuneus pathways as neural correlates of high relapse risk, together with a decision boundary enabling early-stage risk stratification. Conclusions: Integrating connectome-derived, circuit-level information with subtype-aware machine learning may support proactive identification of FED patients at elevated recurrence risk and facilitate targeted early interventions, bridging connectome-level analysis and clinical decision-making.",

    "title": "Dynamical A\u03b2-Tau-Neurodegeneration Model Predicts Alzheimer's Disease Mechanisms and Biomarker Progression",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease is characterised by the pathological interaction of two proteins, amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau, which collectively drive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The progression of A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers is captured by the ATN framework, which is a powerful tool for disease classification. However, since the ATN framework is mainly descriptive, it cannot quantify or predict relationships between biomarkers over time. We address this limitation by introducing a dynamical ATN (dATN) model that mechanistically simulates the spatiotemporal progression of A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration. The dATN model integrates mechanisms of prion-like protein aggregation of A{beta} and tau, network-based tau propagation, A{beta}-driven catalysis of tau progression, and tau-driven neurodegeneration. We calibrated the model using multimodal longitudinal imaging data from both the ADNI and BioFINDER-2 cohorts and show that it accurately fits longitudinal regional A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration data. Using the dATN model, we show that A{beta}-induced effects predict Braak-like cortical tau progression, that the spatial colocalisation of A{beta} and tau is a crucial biomarker of disease acceleration, and that tau-driven atrophy strongly correlates with observed neurodegeneration. Furthermore, by integrating the disease progression model with pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic simulations, we present a powerful tool that facilitates regional evaluation of therapeutic strategies targeting A{beta}, identification of critical intervention windows, and prediction of heterogeneous treatment effects across brain regions. This framework unifies mechanistic understanding with clinical imaging biomarkers, offering a quantitative approach for forecasting disease progression, testing mechanistic hypotheses, and optimising personalised treatment strategies in AD.",

    "content": "Cognitive flexibility is an executive function that enables adapting behaviour to a changing environment and is thus critical for daily life. The degree of its preservation upon healthy aging and the neural mechanisms underlying it are still a matter of debate. To investigate the electrophysiological correlates of cognitive flexibility in older age, we measured cognitive flexibility in 99 young (24.75 {+/-} 4.45 years) and 83 older adults (69.19 {+/-} 6.25) using electroencephalography (EEG). Compared to young adults, older adults showed a more conservative response pattern with longer reaction times, but lower error rates (speed-accuracy tradeoff). In the EEG, both age groups exhibited increased theta-power during set-shifting, with a fronto-central peak in the young, but a more fronto-lateral topography in older adults. Importantly, both groups displayed increases in theta coherence and global efficiency during set-shifting, but coherence modulations were restricted in frontocentral areas in the young but were diminished and distributed across the scalp in the older. Better set-shifting performance was most strongly associated with high coherence and global efficiency irrespective of age group. These results point to an age-related change of cortical processing underlying cognitive flexibility which involves the employment of more distributed neural resources for successful task completion.",

    "content": "<p>Hey HN, we're Haakam, Michael, and Adi. We're building AgentMail (<a href=\"https://agentmail.to\">https://agentmail.to</a>), the email inbox API for agents. We\u2019re not talking about AI for your email, this is email for your AI.<p>Email is an optimal interface for long-running agents. It\u2019s multithreaded and asynchronous with full support for rich text and files. It\u2019s a universal protocol with identity and authentication built in. Moreover, a lot of workflow critical context already lives in email.<p>We wanted to build email agents that you can forward your work to and get back a completed task. The agents could act entirely autonomously as you wouldn't need to delegate your identity. If they did get stuck they could just send you, or anyone else, an email.<p>Using Gmail, we kept getting stuck on the limitations of their API. No way to create inboxes programmatically. Rate and sending limits. OAuth for every single inbox. Keyword search that doesn't understand context. Per-seat pricing that doesn't work for agents.<p>So we built what we wished existed: an email provider for developers. APIs for creating inboxes and configuring domains. Email parsing and threading. Text extraction from attachments. Realtime webhooks and websockets. Semantic search across inboxes. Usage-based pricing that works for agents.<p>Developers, startups, and enterprises are already deploying email agents with AgentMail. Agents that convert conversations and documents into structured data. Agents that source quotes, negotiate prices, and get the best deals. Agents that emulate internet users for training models on end-to-end tasks.<p>Here's demo of Clawdbots communicating using AgentMail: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Y0MfUWS3LKQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/Y0MfUWS3LKQ</a><p>You can get started with AgentMail for free at <a href=\"https://agentmail.to\">https://agentmail.to</a><p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46812608\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46812608</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Differential isoform-specific control of KCC2 function in developing cortical neurons",
    "content": "The K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 is essential for fast synaptic inhibition in the mature brain. It is encoded by a single gene and expressed as two isoforms: KCC2a and KCC2b, which differ in their N-terminal domains. While KCC2b is predominant, the function of the weakly expressed KCC2a isoform remains unclear. Here, we reveal that KCC2a is a potent, bidirectional regulator of KCC2b membrane stability and function in cortical neurons. In immature neurons, where WNK-SPAK kinase activity is high, KCC2a promotes SPAK-dependent phosphorylation of KCC2b at Thr1007, which likely contributes to hindering its membrane expression and function. Conversely, in mature neurons with low basal WNK-SPAK activity, KCC2a promotes KCC2b expression, clustering, and function. At this stage, although accounting for less than 5% of total KCC2 mRNA, KCC2a is enriched in dendrites and within KCC2 clusters, where it prevents clathrin-mediated KCC2b endocytosis, as well as polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus, KCC2a acts as a developmental switch that first inhibits KCC2b during early development and then ensures its membrane stability to support effective synaptic inhibition in the adult brain.",

    "content": "The MNI152 template is widely regarded as a representative average brain in neuroimaging, computational modeling, and neuromodulation research; however, its fidelity as a true population mean has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we compared the MNI152 6th generation nonlinear template to 436 individual MRI from a publicly available dataset, including Asian, Black, and White participants. We quantified the gross brain dimensions and extracted the mean scaling, shear, and voxel-wise Jacobian determinants from the linear and nonlinear registrations between the template and each subject. Across all racial groups, the MNI152 brain exhibited substantially larger radii than the population means, with z-scores frequently exceeding 1.0. The linear scaling factors indicated consistent contraction of the template, and voxel-wise Jacobian fields revealed spatially heterogeneous deformations, demonstrating that the template differs from real brains in both size and shape. These findings suggest that the MNI152 template does not reflect the average morphology of contemporary population samples and that linear registration alone cannot resolve these discrepancies. Therefore, more robust and unbiased template-generation pipelines may be necessary for applications requiring anatomically accurate head models.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study investigated the distinct mechanistic pathways linking depression, sleep disturbances, and cognitive decline in Parkinson\u2019s disease, with emphasis on differential roles of daytime sleepiness versus rapid eye movement sleep disorder.ParticipantsThe study included 450 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients enrolled in the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) between 2010 and 2024, leveraging longitudinal clinical and biomarker data.MeasurementsDepressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS), sleep disturbances (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS for daytime sleepiness; REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire, RBDSQ), and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) were analyzed using mixed-effects models and structural equation modeling (SEM) with bootstrapped mediation.ResultsStructural equation modeling demonstrated excellent model fit (CFI/TLI\u202f>\u202f0.94; RMSEA < 0.08). Analyses revealed distinct pathological pathways: (1) Excessive daytime sleepiness impaired cognition fully through depression mediation (indirect effect \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.084, 95%CI [\u22120.097,-0.028], 66.1% mediated), while (2) REM sleep behavior disorder showed both direct negative effects on cognition (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.116, p\u202f=\u202f0.035) and depression-mediated effects (indirect effect \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.071, 95%CI [\u22120.110,-0.029], 38.2% mediated). These results highlight different intervention targets - treating depressive symptoms may fully mitigate cognitive impacts of daytime hypersomnia, while RBD may require both antidepressant and direct neuroprotective approaches.ConclusionDivergent neurobehavioral mechanisms underlie sleep-related cognitive decline in PD: daytime sleepiness operates through mood dysregulation, while rapid eye movement sleep disorder involves additional direct neural insult. Interventions targeting these pathways may require distinct strategies.",

    "title": "Hormonal control of postmitotic neuronal identity",
    "content": "The Drosophila central complex is a brain region that coordinates complex behaviors through precisely wired circuits composed of diverse neuronal subtypes. Dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) neurons integrate internal-state signals to regulate sleep, feeding, and energy homeostasis, yet how dFB subtypes are specified and maintained remains unclear. More importantly, how a developmental transcription factor regulates neuronal identity remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the developmental origin and post-mitotic regulation of neuronal identity in dFB subtypes labeled by the 84C10 driver, which innervates layers 6-7 of the fan-shaped body and contributes to nutrient sensing and metabolic adaptation. Using lineage tracing, clonal analysis, and birth-dating, we show that 84C10 dFB neurons derive primarily from the DL1 type II neural stem cell lineage, with a minor contribution from DM4, and are generated during a late larval temporal window after ~48 h after larval hatching (ALH). These late-born neurons maintain expression of ecdysone-responsive transcription factor E93 into adulthood. Selective postmitotic knockdown of E93 in mature 84C10 neurons causes progressive neuronal loss, ectopic expansion of axonal arborizations across fan-shaped body layers, and downregulation of the vesicular glutamate transporter vGLUT. These circuit defects are accompanied by a failure to mount normal triglyceride accumulation in response to high-sugar feeding. Together, our results demonstrate that a late temporal transcription factor, E93, is retained post-mitotically to preserve neuronal survival, layer-specific connectivity, and neurotransmitter identity in a behaviorally relevant dFB population, revealing how developmental programs are repurposed to sustain the long-term function of adult behavioral circuits.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

    "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "CTSSP: A temporal\u2013spectral-spatial joint optimization algorithm for motor imagery EEG decoding",
    "content": "Objective. Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interfaces hold significant promise for neurorehabilitation, yet their performance is often compromised by electroencephalography (EEG) non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and severe cross-session variability. Current decoding methods typically suffer from fragmented optimization, treating temporal, spectral, and spatial features in isolation. Approach. We propose common temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns (CTSSP), a unified framework that jointly optimizes filters across all three domains. The algorithm integrates: (1) multi-scale temporal segmentation to capture dynamic neural evolution, (2) channel-adaptive finite impulse response filters to enhance task-relevant rhythms, and (3) low-rank regularization to improve generalization. Main results. Evaluated across five public datasets, CTSSP achieves state-of-the-art performance. It yielded mean accuracies of 76.9% (within-subject), 68.8% (cross-session), and 69.8% (cross-subject). In within-subject and cross-session scenarios, CTSSP significantly outperformed competing baselines by margins of 2.6%\u201314.6% (p < 0.001) and 2.3%\u201313.8% (p < 0.05), respectively. In cross-subject tasks, it achieved the highest average accuracy, proving competitive against deep learning models. Neurophysiological visualization confirms that the learned filters align closely with motor cortex activation mechanisms. Significance. CTSSP effectively overcomes the limitations of decoupled feature extraction by extracting robust, interpretable, and coupled temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns. It offers a powerful, data-efficient solution for decoding MI EEG in noisy, non-stationary environments. The code is available at https://github.com/PLC-TJU/CTSSP.",

    "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "title": "Automated 3D segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from micro-computed tomography images using anatomy-aware neural networks",
    "content": "Objective. Precise segmentation and quantification of nerve morphology from imaging data are critical for designing effective and selective peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapies. However, prior studies on nerve morphology segmentation suffer from important limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. This study introduces a deep learning approach for robust and automated three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) images. Methods. We developed a multi-class 3D U-Net to segment fascicles and epineurium that incorporates a novel anatomy-aware loss function to ensure that predictions respect nerve topology. We trained and tested the network using subject-level five-fold cross-validation with 100 microCT volumes (11.4 \u03bcm isotropic resolution) from cervical and thoracic vagus nerves stained with phosphotungstic acid from five subjects. We benchmarked the 3D U-Net\u2019s performance against a two-dimensional (2D) U-Net using both standard and anatomy-specific segmentation metrics. Results. Our 3D U-Net generated high-quality segmentations (average Dice similarity coefficient: 0.93). Compared to a 2D U-Net, our 3D U-Net yielded significantly better volumetric overlap, boundary delineation, and fascicle instance detection. The 3D approach reduced anatomical errors (topological and morphological implausibility) by 2.5-fold, provided more consistent inter-slice boundaries, and improved detection of fascicle splits/merges by nearly 6-fold. Significance. Our automated 3D segmentation pipeline provides anatomically accurate 3D maps of peripheral neural morphology from microCT data. The automation allows for high throughput, and the substantial improvement in segmentation quality and anatomical fidelity enhances the reliability of morphological analysis, vagal pathway mapping, and the implementation of realistic computational models. These advancements provide a foundation for understanding the functional organization of the vagus and other peripheral nerves and optimizing PNS therapies.",

    "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Seventeen participants spent three consecutive nights at a sleep laboratory, where awakenings were scheduled to collect dream reports from both REM and NREM sleep. Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

    "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

    "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "title": "Intuitive knowledge of object acoustics enables perceptual separation of physical variables from impact sounds",
    "content": "Upon hearing objects collide, humans can estimate physical attributes such as material and mass. Although the physics of sound generation is well established, the inverse problem that listeners solve - of inferring physical parameters from sound - remains poorly understood. Classical accounts posit the use of acoustic cues that correlate with physical variables, but do not explain how humans might distinguish multiple concurrent physical causes. To study this problem, we built a probabilistic generative model of impact sounds, combining theoretical acoustics with statistics of object resonances measured from hundreds of everyday objects, and used it to synthesize and manipulate experimental stimuli. Humans accurately judged object properties from collision sounds. However, when both of the colliding objects varied, performance was impaired if the distribution of object resonances deviated from those measured in real-world objects. The results suggest that listeners use internal physical models to separate the acoustic contributions of objects in the world.",

    "title": "A Key Regulator of Dendritic Morphology in Supragranular Neocortex Impacts Mismatch Negativity",
    "content": "Background: Cytoskeletal structure and neuronal function are heavily intertwined, and altered pyramidal neuron morphology (e.g., reduced dendritic arbors) has been consistently identified in the neocortex of individuals with psychiatric disorders. A missense mutation in Kalrn (Kalrn-PT) enhances activation of RhoA, a cytoskeletal regulator, and leads to adolescent-onset dendritic regression in supragranular auditory cortex. To investigate the relationship between this spatiotemporally altered cytoskeletal structure and psychiatric-relevant dysfunction, we examine the functional impacts of this genetic mutation, focusing on mismatch negativity -- a common biomarker of altered sensory integration that matures across adolescence. Methods: In Kalrn-PT and littermate wild-type mice, pyramidal dendritic morphology was assessed across primary visual cortex (V1) layers using Golgi staining (n=172 neurons/26 mice). Local field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal spiking were recorded during a visual oddball sequence (n=25 mice). Deviance detection -- the rodent neural analogue of mismatch negativity -- was analyzed across V1 layers. Results: Kalrn-PT mice exhibit reductions in V1 dendritic length specific to layer 2/3, mirroring observations in post-mortem samples from people with psychiatric disorders. Deviance detection was reduced in LFPs from Kalrn-PT mice and absent in layer 2/3 neurons, despite typical feature selectivity and firing rates. These deficits were accompanied by reduced functional connectivity between visual and frontal areas. Conclusions: These results highlight alterations in higher-level sensory cortical integration in Kalrn-PT mice and demonstrate that adolescent-onset, disease-relevant structural and functional phenotypes can be linked by a common upstream effector. Further, these alterations appear restricted to supragranular layers, demonstrating an outsized role for Kalrn, particularly longer isoforms, in superficial neocortex.",

    "title": "Subthreshold Kir and Ih currents modulate excitability of Layer 1 VIP interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex",
    "content": "Cortical layer 1 (L1) is a key site for integrating top-down and bottom-up information and is populated by inhibitory interneurons, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing cells. These interneurons regulate information flow across the cortical column by disinhibiting pyramidal neurons, yet the subthreshold ionic mechanisms that shape their excitability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the electrophysiological properties of L1b VIP interneurons in mouse mPFC, focusing on the role of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) and inward-rectifying potassium current (Kir). Using whole-cell recordings in acute slices, we find that L1b VIP interneurons exhibit constitutively active Ih and Kir conductances. Inhibition of Ih with ZD-7288 hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP), increased input resistance (Rin), and prolonged action potential (AP) duration without altering rheobase or firing frequency, while increasing EPSP-spike coupling probability. Blocking Kir with BaCl2 depolarized the RMP, increased Rin and membrane time constant, reduced rheobase, increased firing frequency, and similarly enhanced EPSP-spike probability and AP duration. Voltage-clamp experiments confirmed the presence of ZD-7288-sensitive Ih and BaCl2-sensitive Kir currents of small amplitude but operating on a high-resistance membrane, consistent with a strong impact on excitability. In contrast, neither Ih nor Kir inhibition affected the amplitude or frequency of spontaneous or miniature EPSCs, indicating that these currents do not measurably alter basal excitatory synaptic transmission. Immunofluorescence revealed weak somatic HCN1 and no detectable HCN2 expression in L1b VIP interneurons. Notably, Kir inhibition unmasked an Ih-dependent voltage sag during hyperpolarizing steps, suggesting that constitutive Kir activity normally masks Ih recruitment at subthreshold potentials. Together, these results indicate that Ih and Kir are active near RMP in L1b VIP interneurons and jointly regulate their passive properties, intrinsic excitability, and EPSP-spike coupling, therefore shaping how L1 VIP cells filter incoming signals and influence information flow within the prefrontal cortical column.",

    "title": "Semantic axes in the brain support analogical representations",
    "content": "In vectorial embeddings of word meaning, semantic features often reflect consistent directions, or axes, within a representational space. A classic example is gender: the vector spanning boy to girl can be added to the embedding for king to predict queen. Here we show that the same principle governs semantically driven neural responses in the human brain. We recorded single-neuron activity in three brain regions while participants listened to podcasts. Across fifteen analogical categories, including gender, number, and antonymy, we observed consistent vectorial directions, resulting in parallelogram structure within the neural manifold. Among pronouns, vectors corresponding to grammatical case, number, person, and possession obeyed the principle of commutativity, resulting in a prismatic structure, demonstrating that semantic axes can be factorized. We found parallelogram structure in all three regions, with some regional specialization: noun pluralization was more robust in the hippocampus than in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or orbitofrontal cortex, whereas verbal conjugation effects were more robust in the ACC. Finally, we found evidence for partial functional specialization at the neuron level: neurons most strongly involved in one analogy type were less involved in others. These principles parallel representational structure observed in large language models. Together, these findings support a geometric basis for analogical reasoning.",

    "content": "Congenital and early-life Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can result in neurologic deficits. Precise mechanisms of injury, especially in the more subtle presentation of postnatal infection, are not fully elucidated. Here, we defined the effects of ZIKV on the developing brain using single cell transcriptomics, histopathology and design-based stereology, diffusion MRI, and neurobehavioral assessments in infant rhesus macaques. ZIKV upregulated interferon-stimulated genes in activated microglia and cell death pathways in neurons and downregulated metabolism and differentiation genes in mature oligodendrocytes. Abnormal micro-organization of the corpus collosum and limbic white matter tracts was seen on diffusion weighted imaging. A curated gene set associated with autism spectrum disorder risk was negatively enriched in inhibitory and excitatory neurons from ZIKV-infected infants, with increased emotional reactivity already evident two weeks following infection. From single cells to organism-level behaviors, these results define the pathways and processes disrupted by early-life ZIKV infection.",

    "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "title": "MS-DASPNet: Multiple Sclerosis lesion segmentation from brain MRI using dual attention and spatial pyramid pooling with transfer learning",
    "content": "Accurate detection and segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a challenging task due to their small size, irregular shape, and variability in different imaging modalities. Precise segmentation of MS lesions from brain MRI is vital for early diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and treatment planning. We introduce MS-DASPNet, a Dual Attention Guided Deep Neural Network specifically designed to address the challenges of MS lesion detection, including small lesion sizes, low contrast, and heterogeneous appearance. MS-DASPNet employs a VGG-16-based encoder, an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) bottleneck for multi-scale context learning, and dual attention modules in each skip connection to simultaneously refine spatial details and enhance channel-wise feature representation. Evaluations on four publicly available datasets, namely ISBI-2015, Mendeley, MICCAI-2016, and MICCAI-2021, demonstrate that MS-DASPNet achieves superior Precision, Dice, Sensitivity, and Jaccard scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. MS-DASPNet attains a Dice score of 0.8736 on the MICCAI-2016 dataset and 0.8706 on the MICCAI-2021 dataset, both outperforming existing segmentation techniques, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in accurate MS lesion segmentation.",

    "content": "Modularity is as a key characteristic of structural and functional brain networks across species and spatial scales. We investigate the stochastic Wilson\u2013Cowan model on a modular network in which synaptic strengths differ between intra-module and inter-module connections. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram comprising symmetric (with low and high activity) and \u201cbroken symmetry\u201d phases. Symmetric phases are characterized by the same low or high activity in all the modules, while the broken symmetry phases are characterized by a high activity in a subset of the modules and low activity in the remaining ones. There are two lines of critical points, the first between the low activity symmetric phase and the high activity symmetric phase, and the second between the low activity symmetric phase and a broken symmetry phase with one active module. At those lines the system shows a critical behavior, with power law distributions in the avalanches. Avalanche shapes differ systematically along the two lines: they are symmetric or right-skewed at the transition with the symmetric phase, but become left-skewed over intermediate durations along critical line with the broken symmetry phase. These results provide a theoretical framework that accounts for both symmetric and left-skewed neural avalanche shapes observed experimentally, linking modular organization to critical brain dynamics.",

    "content": "This study investigates the characteristics and underlying patterns of sports media audiences from a human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) perspective using artificial intelligence\u2013based deep learning analysis, with the aim of providing foundational data for the sports media industry. To this end, a novel unsupervised clustering framework, the Column-conditioned Prototype-Enhanced Deep Embedded Clustering (CoPE-DEC) technique, was employed to model and analyze multidimensional viewer experience data derived from sports media consumption contexts. The analysis identified three distinct audience clusters with differentiated behavioral, attitudinal, and value-oriented characteristics. The first cluster, labeled \u201cSports Value Orientation,\u201d was characterized by enhanced concentration during sports viewing, promotion of cooperative skills, motivation for health and exercise, vicarious satisfaction, aesthetic appreciation of sports movements, and admiration for athletes\u2019 professional and economic success. The second cluster, termed \u201cSports Consumption Culture Orientation,\u201d exhibited a strong preference for sports broadcasts over entertainment content, frequent consumption of online sports media, active engagement with preferred sports, participation in sports-related tourism and activities, acquisition of sports skills through media, and consumption of sports-related products. The third cluster, identified as \u201cSports Attitude Orientation,\u201d reflected predominantly social and emotional dimensions of sports viewing, including improved social adaptation, relationship formation, group cohesion, stress relief, psychological stabilization, healthy competitive attitudes, and enhanced overall wellbeing. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven deep learning approaches, particularly the CoPE-DEC framework, are effective in uncovering latent audience typologies and preference structures in sports media consumption environments. By integrating HCI principles with advanced clustering techniques, this study offers a methodological contribution to audience analysis research and provides practical implications for audience segmentation, personalized content design, and strategic decision-making in the sports media industry. Future research is encouraged to extend this approach by incorporating diverse AI methodologies and multimodal data sources to further advance interdisciplinary insights at the intersection of HCI, artificial intelligence, and sports media studies.",

    "content": "IntroductionPrevious corpus-based study first established an annotated dataset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) discourse, and subsequent modeling of lexicogrammatical patterns distinguished ASD from non-ASD discourse with high performance (accuracy 80%, precision 82%, sensitivity 73%, specificity 87%). That line of research further identified 46 statistically significant discriminators, of which 20 were analyzed in detail. The present study examines 18 additional discriminators and situates them within cognitive-functional domains to clarify their diagnostic relevance. Findings refine the language\u2013cognition interface in ASD and extend the utility of lexicogrammatical profiling for assessment.MethodsThe Tag Linear Model was employed to identify lexicogrammatical features that distinguish ASD and non-ASD discourse. Logistic regression with 10,000 bootstrap iterations was applied to establish statistical significance. Although DNN models yielded higher predictive accuracy, the linear model provided transparent identification of discriminators.ResultsOf the 135 items analyzed, 46 were confirmed as statistically significant discriminators (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Eighteen of these, not previously examined, were analyzed in the present study. The discriminators were mapped onto 12 cognitive-functional domains, including working memory, executive functioning, joint attention, predictive processing, and weak central coherence. The results reveal distinctive patterns across multiple domains, including reduced use of benefactive auxiliaries, relational attributive clauses, obligation modality, evaluative and gradational resources, and mimetic onomatopoeia, reflecting systematic constraints in abstraction, perspective-taking, and pragmatic orientation.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that choice patterns of lexicogrammar in ASD reflect domain-specific cognitive constraints. Interpreting the 18 discriminators within 12 cognitive-functional domains provides a linguistically grounded perspective on the neurocognitive profile of ASD and offers implications for future diagnostic and intervention research.",

    "title": "Motion feature extraction based on semi-supervised learning and long short-term memory network in digital dance",
    "content": "Digital-image technology has broadened the creative space of dance, yet accurately capturing the semantic correspondence between low-level motion data and high-level dance key-points remains challenging, especially when labeled data are scarce. We aim to establish a lightweight, semi-supervised pipeline that can extract discriminative motion features from depth sequences and map them to 3-D key-points of dancers in real time. To achieve pixel-level alignment between dance movement targets and high-dimensional sensory data, we propose a novel LSTM-CNN (Long Short Term Memory-Convolutional Neural Network) framework. Temporal-context features are first extracted by LSTM, after which multi-dimensional spatial features are captured by three convolutional layers and one max-pooling layer; the fused representation is finally regressed to 3-D body key-points. To relieve class imbalance caused by complex postures, an online hard-example mining (OHEM) strategy together with a Dice-cross-entropy weighted loss (3:1) is embedded into semi-supervised learning, enabling the network to converge with only 20% labeled samples. Experiments on the public MSR-Action3D dataset (567 sequences, 20 actions) yielded an average recognition rate of 96.9%, surpassing the best comparison method (MSST) by 1.1%. On our self-established dataset (99 sequences, 11 actions) the accuracy reached 97.99% while training time was reduced by 35% compared with the previous best Multi_perspective_MHPCs approach. Both datasets show low RMSE (\u2264 0.032) between predicted and ground-truth key-points, confirming spatial precision. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can reliably track subtle dance gestures under limited annotation, offering an efficient, low-cost solution for digital choreography, motion-style transfer and interactive stage performance.",

    "content": "The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, known for its governance of the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, has attracted newfound interest due to its role in maintaining bodily homeostasis in various tissue types. Sympathetic activity in the skin is often perturbed in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, aberrant changes in the sympathetic skin response can be detected before clinical manifestations of diabetic neuropathy. Furthermore, sympathetic signaling at neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscle has now been demonstrated to be critical for synapse integrity and proper functioning. Insufficient sympathetic signaling in skeletal muscle underlies the pathogenesis of muscle weakness in several disease states, such as myasthenia syndromes and sarcopenia. Additionally, surgical sympathectomies, a treatment method for conditions that involve heightened sympathetic activity, can give rise to other unwanted side effects, prompting the need for sympathetic trunk reconstruction. Therefore, the sympathetic nervous system, with renewed appreciation of its known functions and developing excitement for its recently discovered functions, remains a source for a wealth of potential discoveries that can further enable us to improve human health.",

    "title": "Sleep regulation in Drosophila: a review of neural circuits and genetics",
    "content": "Sleep in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by a complex and distributed network of neural circuits that are influenced by factors such as internal state, circadian timing, and prior experiences. While no single \u201csleep center\u201d has been identified, key brain regions\u2014including the central complex, the mushroom bodies, and other associative structures\u2014such as ventral nerve cord (VNC) contribute to the modulation of sleep and wakefulness. The roles of these regions appear to be dynamic, context-dependent, and often overlapping, reflecting the multifaceted nature of sleep regulation. At the circuit level, mechanisms such as changes in neuronal firing patterns, neurotransmitter systems (e.g., octopamine, dopamine, GABA), and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity have been shown to regulate sleep-wake cycles. On a molecular scale, a variety of genes\u2014including shaker, fruitless, and GAT\u2014influence sleep regulation through distinct pathways, with perturbations in these genes resulting in significant alterations in sleep duration, architecture, and homeostatic regulation. Recent studies, particularly those utilizing Drosophila sleep mutants, have provided valuable insights into the genetic and circuit-level interactions that govern sleep homeostasis and its coordination with the circadian system. These findings underscore sleep as an emergent property of interacting neural and genetic networks, providing a robust model for understanding the mechanisms of sleep in more complex organisms. This review synthesizes the latest advancements in Drosophila sleep research, with a focus on neural structures and the genetic basis of sleep regulation.",

    "content": "IntroductionSubthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is a standard-of-care (SoC) treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD); however, how therapeutic DBS influences motor output is incompletely understood. Specifically, the extent of electromyographic (EMG) modulation during DBS at therapeutic (or SoC) amplitude and its relationship to activity state could be better characterized.MethodsWe studied the effects of DBS on muscle activity in sixteen participants receiving STN-DBS (in 17 stimulated hemispheres) by recording EMG activity in bilateral biceps, triceps, flexor carpi radialis, and extensor digitorum communis muscles. Data was acquired in the resting state and while participants alternated between isometric contraction and brief relaxation. We recorded EMG activity during low-frequency stimulation at participant-specific therapeutic amplitude and during stimulation using pulse amplitudes slightly above (125%) and below (75%) this level. Stimulus-locked responses from each condition were evaluated for the presence of a myogenic evoked potential.ResultsDBS at therapeutic amplitude elicited a myogenic response almost exclusively in the contralateral upper extremity (CUE), with at least one response occurring in 16 out of 17 hemispheres. Myogenic responses, which typically started between 10-30 milliseconds and often lasted until ~70-150 milliseconds post-stimulation, were more common in biceps/triceps. Responses were more prevalent during active contraction compared to relax/rest states as stimulation amplitude increased.DiscussionThese findings support that STN-DBS-induced myogenic activity is commonplace at therapeutic stimulation amplitudes used clinically; thus, studies evaluating the degree to which myogenic effects during SoC STN DBS are associated with the clinical and side effects of STN DBS therapy are warranted.",

    "content": "IntroductionPrion diseases (PrD) are a group of rapidly progressive dementias. Among its subtypes, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is the most common, affecting around 1\u20132 individuals per million inhabitants yearly. In 2005, Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Health (MH) initiated a surveillance program for CJD, creating a protocol to report the cases. Despite advances, the MH still struggles to make a reliable database to determine PrD profile in Brazil. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to understand the Brazilian PrD surveillance system.MethodsThis is a retrospective and descriptive study based on the epidemiological records of CJD surveillance from 2005 to 2021 in the Ministry of Health\u2019s Epidemiological Bulletin published in 2022.Results1,576 suspected cases of CJD were reported, concentrated in the Southeast, South and Northeast regions of Brazil. Among the notifications, the following age groups predominated: 55\u201374 years (60.2%), 45\u201354 years (15%), and 75\u201385 years (11.8%). Suspected cases were mainly represented by women (53.6%), white individuals (61.4%), and residents of urban areas (90%). 547 cases (34.7%) were confirmed based on the following confirmation criteria: laboratory (65.6%), clinical-epidemiological (29.4%), and not informed (4.9%).ConclusionIn this period, the expected number of cases for the Brazilian population would be 3,200. Additionally to underreporting, the data shared by MH is limited due to the use of a database destined to mainly observe epidemic outbreaks and mismatches between official documents. Despite some progress since 2005, PrD surveillance in Brazil faces significant problems, due to the inaccurate treatment of these data and the lack of a specific database for CJD.",

    "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "content": "arXiv:2601.20402v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful learning tools, but they lack awareness of learners' cognitive and physiological states, limiting their adaptability to the user's learning style. Contemporary learning techniques primarily focus on structured learning paths, knowledge tracing, and generic adaptive testing but fail to address real-time learning challenges driven by cognitive load, attention fluctuations, and engagement levels. Building on findings from a formative user study (N=66), we introduce GuideAI, a multi-modal framework that enhances LLM-driven learning by integrating real-time biosensory feedback including eye gaze tracking, heart rate variability, posture detection, and digital note-taking behavior. GuideAI dynamically adapts learning content and pacing through cognitive optimizations (adjusting complexity based on learning progress markers), physiological interventions (breathing guidance and posture correction), and attention-aware strategies (redirecting focus using gaze analysis). Additionally, GuideAI supports diverse learning modalities, including text-based, image-based, audio-based, and video-based instruction, across varied knowledge domains. A preliminary study (N = 25) assessed GuideAI's impact on knowledge retention and cognitive load through standardized assessments. The results show statistically significant improvements in both problem-solving capability and recall-based knowledge assessments. Participants also experienced notable reductions in key NASA-TLX measures including mental demand, frustration levels, and effort, while simultaneously reporting enhanced perceived performance. These findings demonstrate GuideAI's potential to bridge the gap between current LLM-based learning systems and individualized learner needs, paving the way for adaptive, cognition-aware education at scale.",

While existing intelligent diagnostic system have shown promise, most struggle with dual-user interaction, and dynamic knowledge integration -- limiting their real-world applicability. In this study, we present DiagLink, a dual-user diagnostic assistance system that synergizes large language models (LLMs), knowledge graphs (KGs), and medical experts to support both patients and physicians. DiagLink uses guided dialogues to elicit patient histories, leverages LLMs and KGs for collaborative reasoning, and incorporates physician oversight for continuous knowledge validation and evolution. The system provides a role-adaptive interface, dynamically visualized history, and unified multi-source evidence to improve both trust and usability. We evaluate DiagLink through user study, use cases and expert interviews, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user satisfaction and diagnostic efficiency, while offering insights for the design of future AI-assisted diagnostic systems.",

    "title": "An Autonomous Agent Framework for Feature-Label Extraction from Device Dialogues and Automatic Multi-Dimensional Device Hosting Planning Based on Large Language Models",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.20194v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and smart home technologies, the intelligent transformation of traditional household appliances has become an inevitable trend. This paper presents AirAgent--an LLM-driven autonomous agent framework designed for home air systems. Leveraging a voice-based dialogue interface, AirAgent autonomously and personally manages indoor air quality through comprehensive perception, reasoning, and control. The framework innovatively adopts a two-layer cooperative architecture: Memory-Based Tag Extraction and Reasoning-Driven Planning. First, a dynamic memory tag extraction module continuously updates personalized user profiles. Second, a reasoning-planning model integrates real-time environmental sensor data, user states, and domain-specific prior knowledge (e.g., public health guidelines) to generate context-aware decisions. To support both interpretability and execution, we design a semi-streaming output mechanism that uses special tokens to segment the model's output stream in real time, simultaneously producing human-readable Chain-of-Thought explanations and structured, device-executable control commands. The system handles planning across 25 distinct complex dimensions while satisfying more than 20 customized constraints. As a result, AirAgent endows home air systems with proactive perception, service, and orchestration capabilities, enabling seamless, precise, and personalized air management responsive to dynamic indoor and outdoor conditions. Experimental results demonstrate up to 94.9 percent accuracy and more than 20 percent improvement in user experience metrics compared to competing commercial solutions.",

Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) afford an unprecedented opportunity to present users with quantified disclosure-based re-identification risk (i.e., \"population risk estimates\", PREs). How can PREs be presented to users in a way that promotes informed decision-making, mitigating risk without encouraging unnecessary self-censorship? Using design fictions and comic-boarding, we story-boarded five design concepts for presenting PREs to users and evaluated them through an online survey with N = 44 Reddit users. We found participants had detailed conceptions of how PREs may impact risk awareness and motivation, but envisioned needing additional context and support to effectively interpret and act on risks. We distill our findings into four key design recommendations for how best to present users with quantified privacy risks to support informed disclosure decision-making.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.20100v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI chatbots have proven surprisingly effective at persuading people to change their beliefs and attitudes in lab settings. However, the practical implications of these findings are not yet clear. In this work, we explore the impact of rehabilitative conversations with generative AI chatbots on users who share toxic content online. Toxic behaviors -- like insults or threats of violence, are widespread in online communities. Strategies to deal with toxic behavior are typically punitive, such as removing content or banning users. Rehabilitative approaches are rarely attempted, in part due to the emotional and psychological cost of engaging with aggressive users. In collaboration with seven large Reddit communities, we conducted a large-scale field experiment (N=893) to invite people who had recently posted toxic content to participate in conversations with AI chatbots. A qualitative analysis of the conversations shows that many participants engaged in good faith and even expressed remorse or a desire to change. However, we did not observe a significant change in toxic behavior in the following month compared to a control group. We discuss possible explanations for our findings, as well as theoretical and practical implications based on our results.",

Prior work, however, does not clearly connect the information provided in explanations to user actions to evaluate effectiveness. In this paper, we articulate this connection. We conducted a formative study through 14 interviews with end users in education and medicine. We contribute a catalog of information and associated actions. Our catalog maps 12 categories of information that participants described relying on to take 60 different actions. We show how AI Creators can use the catalog's specificity and breadth to articulate how they expect information in their explanations to lead to user actions and test their assumptions. We use an exemplar XAI system to illustrate this approach. We conclude by discussing how our catalog expands the design space for XAI systems to support actionability.",

Some encourage students to use AI, while others restrict or forbid it. Regardless of their approach, all instructors benefit from understanding how their students actually use AI while writing code. Such insight helps instructors assess whether AI use aligns with their pedagogical goals, enables timely intervention when they find unproductive usage patterns, and establishes effective policies for AI use. However, our survey with programming instructors found that many instructors lack visibility into how students use AI in their code-writing processes. To address this challenge, we introduce Editrail, an interactive system that enables instructors to track students' AI usage, create personalized assessments, and provide timely interventions, all within the workflow of monitoring coding histories. We found that Editrail enables instructors to detect AI use that conflicts with pedagogical goals accurately and to determine when and which students require intervention.",

This can be enabled by making the target object different in one of the visual variables that determine the object's appearance; for example, by changing its color or size. Certain interpretations of the visual search literature have promoted the view that using visual variables such as hue-often labeled as preattentive-would make the target object automatically \"popout,\" implying that an object can be located almost instantly, regardless of the number of objects in the display. In this paper we present a study that serves as a bridge between the extensive visual search literature and visualization, establishing empirical base measurements for the localization task. By testing displays with up to hundreds of objects, we are able to show that none of the common visual variables is immune to the increase in the number of objects. We also provide the first empirically informed comparisons between visual variables for this task in the context of visualization, and show how different visual variables have varying robustness with respect to two additional dimensions: the location of the target and the overall visual arrangement (layout).

    "title": "Treating symptoms or root causes: How does information about causal mechanisms affect interventions?",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.20010v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When deciding how to solve complex problems, it seems important not only to know whether an intervention is helpful but also to understand why. Therefore, the present study investigated whether explicit information about causal mechanisms enables people to distinguish between multiple interventions. It was hypothesised that mechanism information helps them appreciate indirect interventions that treat the root causes of a problem instead of just fixing its symptoms. This was investigated in an experimental hoof trimming scenario in which participants evaluated various interventions. To do so, they received causal diagrams with different types of causal information and levels of mechanistic detail. While detailed mechanism information and its embedding in the context of other influences made participants less sceptical towards indirect interventions, the effects were quite small. Moreover, it did not mitigate participants' robust preference for interventions that only fix a problem's symptoms. Taken together, the findings suggest that in order to help people choose sustainable interventions, it is not sufficient to make information about causal mechanisms available.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.20480v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging data presents challenges for assessing neurodegenerative diseases due to complex non-linear relationships. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks. The remaining latent variables encode affine transformations and intensity variations, capturing confounds such as inter-subject variability and site effects. Our framework effectively extracts disease-related patterns aligned with established Alzheimer's biomarkers, offering an interpretable and adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative progression.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.20236v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Significance: Voltage imaging microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate neural activity both in vivo and in vitro. Various imaging approaches have been developed, including point-scanning, line-scanning and wide-field microscopes, however the effects of their different temporal sampling methods on signal fidelity have not yet been fully investigated. Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.20447v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Enabling natural communication through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains one of the most profound challenges in neuroscience and neurotechnology. While existing frameworks offer partial solutions, they are constrained by oversimplified semantic representations and a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semantic Intent Decoding (SID), a novel framework that translates neural activity into natural language by modeling meaning as a flexible set of compositional semantic units. SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm. Extensive experiments on multilingual EEG and clinical SEEG datasets demonstrate that SID and BrainMosaic offer substantial advantages over existing frameworks, paving the way for natural and effective BCI-mediated communication.",

    "title": "Protein folding stress shapes microglial phenotype in progressive supranuclear palsy",
    "content": "Microglia play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration, yet their response to tau pathology remains incompletely understood. Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing of Amyloid beta plaque-free frontal cortex from 4R tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) brains, we reveal a distinct transcriptional reprogramming of homeostatic microglia. PSP microglia exhibit pronounced protein-folding and ER-stress signatures, elevated homeostatic and MHC class II gene expression, and attenuated cytoskeletal, motility, and interferon-related programs, accompanied by reduced inferred intercellular communication. Neuropathological analysis corroborates a shift toward highly ramified morphologies and increased MHC class II positivity in PSP cortex. In HMC3 cells, pharmacological induction of protein-folding stress recapitulates this phenotype, driving homeostatic gene upregulation and morphological transition to process-bearing forms. We define this protein-folding-stress-associated microglial (PSAM) state as a PSP-linked phenotype mechanistically distinct from disease-associated microglia (DAM), highlighting ER stress as a key driver of microglial remodeling in tauopathies.",

    "title": "Cell-Type Specific Molecular and Functional Consequences of TDP-43 Loss-of-Function in Human Induced Neurons",
    "content": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the cytoplasmic aggregation and nuclear depletion of the TDP-43 protein. The latter impairs TDP-43 function as an RNA-binding protein and compromises the repression of cryptic splicing events, affecting both glutamatergic upper motor neurons and cholinergic lower motor neurons. This study systematically investigated the molecular and functional consequences of TDP-43 knockdown in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons (iGNs) and cholinergic motor neurons (iMNs) using antisense oligonucleotides. The results demonstrated that TDP-43 loss elicits widespread, cell-type-specific changes in gene expression and alternative splicing. Notably, a shared subset of ALS-associated targets, including STMN2 and UNC13A, were consistently downregulated and mis-spliced across both neuronal subtypes. Functionally, Microelectrode Array (MEA) electrophysiology recordings revealed that TDP-43 knockdown induces a hyperexcitable phenotype in both neuronal populations, though they exhibited distinct network patterns: iGNs displayed synchronized bursting and significant shifts in overall electrophysiological profiles, while iMNs showed asynchronous firing. Furthermore, the inclusion of astrocytes in co-culture models expanded the repertoire of detectable cryptic splicing, including an event in HDGFL2 previously identified in patient cerebrospinal fluid. Despite these profound molecular and functional deficits, TDP-43 depletion did not impact neuronal viability or increase susceptibility to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. These findings validate hiPSC-derived iGNs and iMNs as relevant models for ALS and highlight the critical necessity of considering cell-type specificity when elucidating pathogenesis and developing targeted therapies.",

    "title": "Flexible perception of face attributes under naturalistic visual constraints",
    "content": "How does human brain adapt face perception to naturalistic visual constraints? While faces are typically perceived under dynamic and uncertain conditions, most studies use static presentation and enough temporal exposure, leaving the neural mechanisms of adaptive face processing poorly understood. Here, we employed steady-state evoked potential electroencephalography (EEG) to track how perception of multiple face attributes (age, emotion, gender, and race) adjusts to two ecologically relevant scenarios: (1) faces gradually sharpening from blur to clear (mimicking approaching from a distance), and (2) faces presented with incrementally increasing exposure times (mimicking brief, flashed encounters). By progressively increasing sensory input (via spatial frequency content in Experiment 1 and exposure time in Experiment 2) in a stepwise manner, we show that emotion and race categorization emerge early, even under high blur (e.g., 4.89 cycles/image) or brief exposures (e.g., 41.7-50 ms), reflecting coarse visual processing. In contrast, age discrimination requires higher clarity (e.g., 7.31 cycles/image) but shorter exposure (e.g., 41.7 ms) if clear images are presented. In both scenarios, gender processing exhibits the strongest dependence on clarity (e.g., 10.94 cycles/image) and time (e.g., 66.7 ms). Representational similarity analyses further show that reliable response patterns for emotion and race emerge earlier in the posterior brain region relative to those for gender in both experiments. Together, these results identify a flexible temporal order for face perception that adapts to naturalistic visual constraints, bridging the gap between controlled laboratory paradigms and naturalistic social vision.",

Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve released <a href=\"https://github.com/jmg049/Spectrograms\">Spectrograms</a>, a library designed to provide an all-in-one pipeline for spectral analysis. It was originally built to handle the spectrogram logic for my <a href=\"https://github.com/jmg049/audio_samples\">audio_samples</a> project and was abstracted into its own toolkit to provide a more complete set of features than what is currently available in the Python ecosystem.</p> <h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p><strong>Spectrograms</strong> provides a high-performance pipeline for computing spectrograms and performing FFT-based operations on 1D signals (audio) and 2D signals (images). It supports various frequency scales (Linear, Mel, ERB, LogHz) and amplitude scales (Power, Magnitude, Decibels), alongside general-purpose 2D FFT operations for image processing like spatial filtering and convolution.</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>This library is designed for developers and researchers requiring production-ready DSP tools. It is particularly useful for those needing batch processing efficiency, low-latency streaming support, or a Python API where metadata (like frequency/time axes) remains unified with the computation.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p>Unlike standard alternatives such as SciPy or Librosa which return raw <code>ndarrays</code>, <strong>Spectrograms</strong> returns context-aware objects that bundle metadata with the data. It uses a plan-based architecture implemented in Rust that releases the GIL, offering significant performance advantages in batch processing and parallel execution compared to naive NumPy-based implementations.</p> <hr /> <h3>Key Features:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Integrated Metadata</strong>: Results are returned as <code>Spectrogram</code> objects rather than raw <code>ndarrays</code>. This ensures the frequency and time axes are always bundled with the data. The object maintains the parameters used for its creation and provides direct access to its <code>duration()</code>, <code>frequencies</code>, and <code>times</code>. These objects can act as drop-in replacements for <code>ndarrays</code> in most scenarios since they implement the <code>__array__</code> interface.</li> <li><strong>Unified API</strong>: The library handles the full process from raw samples to scaled results. It supports <code>Linear</code>, <code>Mel</code>, <code>ERB</code>, and <code>LogHz</code> frequency scales, with amplitude scaling in <code>Power</code>, <code>Magnitude</code>, or <code>Decibels</code>. It also includes support for chromagrams, MFCCs, and general-purpose 1D and 2D FFT functions.</li> <li><strong>Performance via Plan Reuse</strong>: For batch processing, the <code>SpectrogramPlanner</code> caches FFT plans and pre-computes filterbanks to avoid re-calculating constants in a loop. <strong>Benchmarks included in the repository show this approach to be faster across tested configurations compared to standard SciPy or Librosa implementations.</strong> The repo includes detailed benchmarks for various configurations.</li> <li><strong>GIL-free Execution</strong>: The core compute is implemented in Rust and releases the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This allows for actual parallel processing of audio batches using standard Python threading.</li> <li><strong>2D FFT Support</strong>: The library includes support for 2D signals and spatial filtering for image processing using the same design philosophy as the audio tools.</li> </ul> <h3>Quick Example: Linear Spectrogram</h3> <p>```python import numpy as np import spectrograms as sg</p> <h1>Generate a 440 Hz test signal</h1> <p>sr = 16000 t = np.linspace(0, 1.0, sr) samples = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 440.0 * t)</p> <h1>Configure parameters</h1> <p>stft = sg.StftParams(n_fft=512, hop_size=256, window=&quot;hanning&quot;) params = sg.SpectrogramParams(stft, sample_rate=sr)</p> <h1>Compute linear power spectrogram</h1> <p>spec = sg.compute_linear_power_spectrogram(samples, params)</p> <p>print(f&quot;Frequency range: {spec.frequency_range()} Hz&quot;) print(f&quot;Total duration: {spec.duration():.3f} s&quot;) print(f&quot;Data shape: {spec.data.shape}&quot;)</p> <p>```</p> <h3>Batch Processing with Plan Reuse</h3> <p>```python planner = sg.SpectrogramPlanner()</p> <h1>Pre-computes filterbanks and FFT plans once</h1> <p>plan = planner.mel_db_plan(params, mel_params, db_params)</p> <h1>Process signals efficiently</h1> <p>results = [plan.compute(s) for s in signal_batch]</p> <p>```</p> <h3>Benchmark Overview</h3> <p>The following table summarizes average execution times for various spectrogram operators using the Spectrograms library in Rust compared to NumPy and SciPy implementations.Comparisons to librosa are contained in the repo benchmarks since they target mel spectrograms specifically.</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Operator</th> <th>Rust (ms)</th> <th>Rust Std</th> <th>Numpy (ms)</th> <th>Numpy Std</th> <th>Scipy (ms)</th> <th>Scipy Std</th> <th>Avg Speedup vs NumPy</th> <th>Avg Speedup vs SciPy</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>db</td> <td>0.257</td> <td>0.165</td> <td>0.350</td> <td>0.251</td> <td>0.451</td> <td>0.366</td> <td>1.363</td> <td>1.755</td> </tr> <tr> <td>erb</td> <td>0.601</td> <td>0.437</td> <td>3.713</td> <td>2.703</td> <td>3.714</td> <td>2.723</td> <td>6.178</td> <td>6.181</td> </tr> <tr> <td>loghz</td> <td>0.178</td> <td>0.149</td> <td>0.547</td> <td>0.998</td> <td>0.534</td> <td>0.965</td> <td>3.068</td> <td>2.996</td> </tr> <tr> <td>magnitude</td> <td>0.140</td> <td>0.089</td> <td>0.198</td> <td>0.133</td> <td>0.319</td> <td>0.277</td> <td>1.419</td> <td>2.287</td> </tr> <tr> <td>mel</td> <td>0.180</td> <td>0.139</td> <td>0.630</td> <td>0.851</td> <td>0.612</td> <td>0.801</td> <td>3.506</td> <td>3.406</td> </tr> <tr> <td>power</td> <td>0.126</td> <td>0.082</td> <td>0.205</td> <td>0.141</td> <td>0.327</td> <td>0.288</td> <td>1.630</td> <td>2.603</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <hr /> <p>Want to learn more about computational audio and image analysis?

    "title": "Spatial memory performance is associated with region-specific coordination of hippocampo-cortical sleep oscillations",
    "content": "Sleep plays a critical role in memory consolidation, yet how coordination among sleep oscillations across hippocampo-cortical circuits relates to behavioral performance remains incompletely understood. Here, we examined how cross-regional coordination of cardinal sleep oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (nREM) sleep relates to spatial memory performance. Adult rats were trained in an object-place recognition task and allowed to sleep while local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from dorsal and ventral hippocampus (CA1d and CA1v) and retrosplenial, prefrontal, and lateral entorhinal cortices. We first confirm that nREM sleep duration, but not REM sleep, is positively associated with spatial memory performance. We then characterized the temporal relationships between hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and cortical spindles and slow oscillations, revealing region- and oscillation-specific coordination patterns that depend on the dorso-ventral origin of hippocampal ripple events. Finally, by comparing task-related changes in ripple-triggered cortical activity between low- and high-performing sessions, we identify selective, performance-dependent modulation of hippocampo-cortical coupling during task-related sleep. Spatial memory performance was consistently associated with enhanced ripple-spindle and ripple-slow oscillation coupling driven by dorsal hippocampal ripples, particularly in interactions with entorhinal and prefrontal cortices, whereas ventral hippocampal interactions failed to show behavioural association. Together, these results reveal that spatial memory performance is linked to region- and timing-specific coordination of sleep oscillations across hippocampo-cortical networks during nREM sleep, highlighting a functional differentiation of dorsal and ventral hippocampal contributions to sleep-dependent memory consolidation.",

    "content": "We present an isotropic 7.72 microns/voxel post-mortem human brain dataset acquired using Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) at the ESRF Extremely Brilliant Source, beamline BM18. This fills a critical gap between whole-brain MRI at 100-micron resolution and serial-section histological reconstructions at 20 microns or finer. HiP-CT contrast, derived from X-ray phase shifts, enables rich 3D visualisation of complex neuroanatomy including white-matter bundles, microvasculature, and sub-nuclei. We provide open-source workflows for online data exploration, subvolume download, segmentation, and reintegration of analyses into the full dataset. We demonstrate the potential of this resource by tracing vasculature over long distances, segmenting nuclei, and extracting white-matter orientations with 3D structure-tensor analysis. High-resolution human brain datasets are transformative for quantitative neuroanatomy, circuit mapping, and validation of clinical imaging; this openly available resource is a critical step for global access to next-generation multiscale brain imaging.",

    "content": "In natural environments, animals must detect behaviorally relevant odors despite variability in both odor mixture composition and stimulus intensity. Although mice can identify salient odors embedded in complex mixtures, how target concentration and background complexity jointly constrain discrimination remains unclear. We trained mice in a two-alternative forced choice task to identify target odors embedded in mixtures containing up to 16 background components. After performance stabilized, we systematically varied target odor concentration. Discrimination accuracy declined with decreasing target concentration but showed little additional dependence on background complexity. Using a biophysically grounded model of olfactory bulb glomerular responses, we show that linear decoding reproduces behavioral performance when intrinsic neural noise dominates over background-driven variability. Manifold capacity analysis revealed that neural representations remain efficiently structured for odor discrimination despite variation in background complexity. These results define a noise-limited regime of olfactory discrimination in which target detectability is primarily constrained by neural sensitivity rather than background interference.",

    "title": "Large-Scale Control of Neuronal Networks In Vitro Using Perforated Microfluidic Devices",
    "content": "Neurons in the brain are organized and connected into complex networks in which electrochemical signaling forms the basis for all brain function. Cortical neuronal networks are arranged in distinct modular, layered, and hierarchical structures, underlying its diverse functions such as learning, memory, or vision. Modern biotechnology has enabled an array of techniques to culture human neural cells, ranging from discreet co-cultures to complex developmental organoids, but all of which almost exclusively form unstructured and hypersynchronous networks. Overcoming this and capturing the functional and anatomical properties of the brain textit{in vitro} has proven to be a great challenge. Current techniques for guiding neuronal connectivity textit{in vitro} is often limited to a small fraction of the total population of neural cells, leaving most of the culture effectively unguided. To provide large-scale guidance of neurons in culture, we developed a microtunnel device which allows large-scale cell entry through an array of perforations, and guides neuronal network formation through a series of tunnels. Human neural stem cells capable of forming extensive neuronal projections were used to investigate several different microtunnel designs. One particularity noteworthy design which produced predominantly unidirectional growth was used to successfully validate its effect on propagation of neural activity on microelectrode arrays. Serendipitously, we found that our microtunnels had an extraordinary effect on signal-to-noise ratio and the quality of electrophysiological recordings with regards to number of active channels and detected spikes. Since we often found the neuronal growth surprising, we developed a simple computer model which could reproduce neuronal growth in the various tunnels, allowing computer aided design (CAD) of future projects.",

    "content": "Despite the widespread use of EEG decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA), the extent of the impact of electrode density on these multivariate approaches has not been systematically evaluated, particularly across different cognitive domains. Here, we systematically compared four electrode configurations (19, 32, 64, and 128 channels) across three EEG datasets encompassing visual perception, visual search, and emotional processing. All datasets were recorded at 128 channels and subsequently reduced to 64, 32, and 19 channels via electrode subset selection based on the international 10-20 system. Time-resolved decoding and spatial RSA were computed for each configuration with paired statistical evaluation. Decoding sensitivity demonstrated clear task dependence: in the color-harmony paradigm, performance improved markedly with higher densities, consistent with spatially distributed perceptual representations, whereas decoding in the icon-search and dot-probe tasks remained stable across densities, indicating diminishing returns of additional electrodes although all configuration yielded robust decoding accuracies that above chance level. RSA results were comparatively robust, with relative representational similarity structures largely preserved even for 16 channel counts. These findings demonstrate that low-density setups can be sufficient, offering practical guidance for EEG channel selection and supporting the use of low-density EEG in real-world applications, including wearable systems, mobile EEG recordings, and clinical or rehabilitation settings.",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "content": "Klein et al. (2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

    "title": "Peripheral phoneme encoding and discrimination in aging and hearing impairment",
    "content": "Speech perception difficulties in noise are common among older adults and individuals with hearing impairment, even when audiometric thresholds appear normal. We examined how aging, cochlear synaptopathy (CS), and outer hair cell (OHC) damage affect speech encoding and phoneme discrimination. Envelope-following responses (EFRs) to rectangular amplitude-modulated (RAM) tones and speech-like phoneme pairs were recorded in quiet using EEG, and behavioral discrimination was assessed in quiet, ipsilateral, and contralateral noise. Stimuli were designed to target temporal envelope (TENV) or temporal fine structure (TFS) encoding. Results showed that RAM-EFR amplitudes decreased gradually with age, consistent with emerging CS, while magnitudes of high-frequency TENV-based EFRs in quiet were most reduced in older hearing-impaired listeners with combined CS and OHC damage. In contrast, EFRs targeting low-frequency TENV encoding in quiet remained preserved. Behaviorally, phoneme discrimination of TFS contrasts worsened with OHC loss and age in quiet and contralateral noise, respectively, while there was no significant effect of age on the discrimination of TENV contrasts. Considering that high-frequency contrasts are discriminated via place-based spectral cues, low-frequency contrasts rely on TFS, and the EFR reflects primarily TENV, this framework explains why EFRs decline for high-frequency cues without perceptual loss, while EFRs remain stable for low-frequency cues even as TFS-based discrimination deteriorates. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into how neural coding deficits relate to perceptual outcomes. Combining electrophysiological and behavioral measures might provide a sensitive framework for detecting subclinical auditory deficits to earlier diagnose age-related and hidden hearing loss.",

    "content": "Diurnal rhythms in brain transcription align neural, immune, and metabolic processes with the light-dark cycle and are profoundly disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the regional organization of diurnal transcription in the healthy and diseased brain remains poorly defined. Using large-scale spatial transcriptomics, we mapped 24-hour rhythmic transcription across cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. We identified marked regional differences in rhythmicity, including distinct oscillatory signatures across cortical areas and along the rostro-caudal axis. In the APP23 mouse model of AD, pathology-vulnerable brain regions exhibited early, region-specific disruption of diurnal transcription prior to substantial amyloid plaque deposition. These findings reveal a spatially organized architecture of brain diurnal rhythms and identify early rhythmic dysregulation as a feature of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Tunable Tau Expression in C. elegans Neurons Reveals that Early-AD Tau Phosphorylation Selectively Impacts Behavior and Mitochondrial Quality Control",
    "content": "Tau protein accumulates myriad post-translational modifications as Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses, and early-disease tau modifications such as phosphorylation at threonine 231 (T231) likely play a key role in AD pathogenesis. Here, a series of \"tunable tau\" strains was developed in C. elegans to test the relative impact of tau pseudo-phosphorylation of T231 (T231E) compared to protein expression level as a driver of phenotypic penetrance and severity. Multiple copies of a cassette coding for pan-neuronal wildtype tau or T231E were inserted at a genomic safe harbor loci to create a repertoire of strains expressing tau from low to high levels. In stereotypical behavioral assays of locomotory activity, T231E selectively impacted phenotypic severity compared to wild-type human tau controls, which further tracked with age and tau expression level. However, deficits in associative memory were non-selective between tau and T231E. Moreover, genetic, pharmacologic, and molecular approaches indicated that mitophagy modulation could suppress T231E phenotypes. Additionally, a robust mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) occurred in T231E, and loss of atfs-1, a transcription factor central to the UPRmt suppressed T231E toxicity. These results demonstrate that phenotypic severity is invariably associated with tau dosage, while early-AD relevant modifications can be causative drivers of selective deficits. Consistent with recent findings, enhancing mitophagy or suppressing potentially maladaptive consequences of persistent UPRmt induction can be beneficial. This provides a solid foundation for further interrogation into mitochondrial quality control disruption as a potential root cause for AD pathogenesis.",

An error in this visual perception could prove fatal. How object information is untangled to avoid errors remains unclear. Here we show that LC10d visual projection neurons in Drosophila melanogaster mediate avoidance of visual objects devoid of a chemosensory profile. LC10d neurons are broadly tuned to objects and project to same retinorecipient brain region that receives inputs from LC10a neurons, which are required for tracking. The descending neurons DNa10 are directly downstream of the anterior-looking LC10d sub-population and mediate LC10d-dependent avoidance. Our work demonstrates the use of two similar neuron types and chunking of the visual field as strategies to disentangle similar sets of visual cues. Discrete objects are avoided until chemosensory information is gathered to enable decision making on whether to engage in social interactions or rather to avoid them.",

    "content": "Systemic hypertension is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, yet the mechanistic basis connecting the two conditions remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that hypertensive rats develop accelerated retinal degeneration characterized by retinal thinning, functional impairment, reduced perfusion, and progressive neuroinflammation. Critically, these changes occur despite persistently lower intraocular pressure (IOP), indicating an IOP-independent mechanism of pathology. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses identified a robust activation of the retinal endothelin system, with endothelin-2 (EDN2) being the earliest and most significantly upregulated component. AAV-delivered retinal Edn2 knockdown completely restored retinal function, ameliorated neuroinflammation, and enhanced retinal blood flow in hypertensive rats. Pharmacological blockade of endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), but not type B, replicated these protective effects without altering IOP. Our findings establish EDN2 as a central, IOP-independent driver of hypertension-associated retinal neurodegeneration and identify the endothelin-EDNRA axis as a potential therapeutic target to prevent vision loss in hypertensive patients.",

    "content": "Modern digital environments expose the brain to a dense stream of personally meaningful cues that differ markedly from the conditions under which sensory systems evolved. Understanding how the brain responds and adapts to such environments is increasingly relevant for cognitive and mental well-being. In this study, we used auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during a task-irrelevant auditory oddball paradigm to obtain a time-resolved account of neural responses to smartphone notifications. We dissociated the effects of generic notification sounds from the learning-related effects of personalized notification sounds, and examined how these responses varied across levels of smartphone use. Among early stages of processing, generic tones exhibited experience-dependent strengthening of auditory representations, whereas personalized tones engaged stable, pre-learned representations, as reflected in P2 dynamics. The strongest stimulus-dependent modulation was observed in pre-attentive salience detection, reflected in the mismatch negativity (MMN), which was earlier and larger for personalized tones compared to generic ones. At later stages, attentional orienting and extended evaluative processing showed distinct patterns that were differentially sensitive to stimulus identity and smartphone use. Notably, smartphone usage levels modulated later attentional and evaluative stages (P3a and LPP) without altering early pre-attentive prediction-error signaling. Overall, our findings demonstrate that personalized smartphone notifications do not uniformly increase neural distraction. Instead, they engage robust and rapid pre-attentive prediction-error signaling that is largely independent of usage, while habitual smartphone use selectively shapes later attentional orienting and evaluative dynamics.",

The same improvement now landing both in psutil and CPython itself.</p> <p><a href=\"https://gmpy.dev/blog/2026/event-driven-process-waiting\">https://gmpy.dev/blog/2026/event-driven-process-waiting</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/grodola\"> /u/grodola </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpp42k/from_python_33_to_today_ending_15_years_of/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpp42k/from_python_33_to_today_ending_15_years_of/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "First In Vivo Demonstration of Nose-to-Brain Drug Delivery of Memantine Using NosaPlugs Nasal Inserts",
    "content": "Treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease remains a challenge due to ineffective drug delivery to the brain. In recent years, intranasal administration has emerged as a promising non-invasive approach for nose-to-brain delivery. Compared to other routes of administration, nose-to-brain delivery provides a possibility of bypassing both the blood-brain-barrier and the first-pass metabolism in the liver, allowing for a decrease in the delivered dose and thereby a reduced risk of systemic side-effects. While the most common nasal devices, spray pumps, ensure a wide distribution in the nasal cavity and a fast onset of action, a slower release and increased retention time is desired for treatment of many neurological disorders. In this study, we tested the feasibility of a novel nasal insert, NosaPlugs, for prolonged release and delivery of memantine. Using an in vitro anatomically realistic nasal model, we demonstrated cumulative release of memantine from the nasal inserts up to eight hours. Additionally, the therapeutic substance was distributed to all parts of the nasal cavity, with higher amounts accumulating in the middle part. In vivo, an acute dose of memantine in the gas phase released from the nasal device reached pharmacologically relevant levels in both plasma and the brains of the mice. Future research should investigate the release and delivery of alternative substances interesting for brain diseases, and larger animal models are required to determine the efficacy of nose-to-brain delivery using NosaPlugs nasal inserts. Importantly, our study provides the first proof-of-concept that NosaPlugs can serve as an effective intranasal device for targeted drug delivery to the brain.",

    "title": "Calcium-binding protein expression alone is insufficient to identify and classify GABAergic neurons in macaque cortex",
    "content": "Understanding neuron subclasses and their functional consequences can contribute to understanding brain circuits. A scheme long used to classify GABAergic neurons in the neocortex is based on expression of three calcium-binding proteins (CBPs): parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR). Because CB and CR are frequently co-expressed by individual neurons in rodents, this scheme has been replaced by one based on PV and two signaling peptides: somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In macaques, however, CBPs are generally not co-expressed, and so their use has persisted despite suggestions that the underlying populations are not, in fact, entirely GABAergic. We set out to quantitatively evaluate CBPs as a classification scheme for GABAergic neurons in early and mid-level visual regions in macaque cortex. Combining immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we find that up to half of neurons expressing CBPs are likely not GABAergic. Furthermore, contrary to what has been previously suggested, the GABAergic subpopulations cannot be distinguished based on staining intensity. Thus, the CBP-based classification scheme is not valid, at least as it has traditionally been used. Instead, we find support for co-labeling CB and CR neurons with SST and VIP, an approach that can identify GABAergic subpopulations within the CBP classes; or simply adopting the PV/SST/VIP scheme. We discuss the functional implications of expressing these various cell type markers, and how consideration of marker functions can support proper selection of a classification scheme for a given experimental purpose.",

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

It provides Django-style query API (<code>Model.objects.filter()</code>), supports PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite, and offers significant performance improvements through Rust-powered SQL generation and connection pooling via PyO3.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>This is a library for Python developers who: - Use FastAPI or other async frameworks - Want Pydantic models without ORM wrappers - Need high-performance database operations - Prefer Django-style query syntax</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>Unlike existing ORMs: - <strong>Django/SQLAlchemy/Tortoise</strong>: Have their own model systems; Oxyde uses native Pydantic v2 - <strong>SQLModel</strong>: Uses Pydantic as a wrapper; Oxyde treats Pydantic as the primary model layer - <strong>No magic</strong>: No lazy loading or descriptors \u2014 explicit <code>.join()</code> for relations</p> <hr /> <h2>Architecture</h2> <p><code> \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 Python Layer \u2502 \u2502 OxydeModel (Pydantic v2) \u2502 \u2502 Query DSL (Django-like) \u2502 \u2502 AsyncDatabase \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2502 MessagePack \u25bc \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 Rust Core (PyO3) \u2502 \u2502 IR parsing \u2502 \u2502 SQL generation (sea-query) \u2502 \u2502 Connection pools (sqlx) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u25bc PostgreSQL / SQLite / MySQL </code></p> <h3>How it works</h3> <ol> <li>Python builds a query via DSL, producing a dict (Intermediate Representation)</li> <li>Dict is serialized to MessagePack and passed to Rust</li> <li>Rust deserializes IR, generates SQL via sea-query</li> <li>sqlx executes the query, result comes back via MessagePack</li> <li>Pydantic validates and creates model instances</li> </ol> <hr /> <h2>Code example</h2> <p>```python from oxyde import OxydeModel, Field, db</p> <p>class User(OxydeModel): id: int | None = Field(default=None, db_pk=True) name: str email: str = Field(db_unique=True) age: int | None = None</p> <pre><code>class Meta: is_table = True </code></pre> <p>async def main(): await db.init(default=&quot;postgresql://localhost/mydb&quot;)</p> <pre><code># Create user = await User.objects.create(name=&quot;Alice&quot;, email=&quot;alice@example.com&quot;, age=30) # Read with filtering (Django-style lookups) adults = await User.objects.filter(age__gte=18).order_by(&quot;-name&quot;).all() # Update await User.objects.filter(id=1).update(age=31) # Transactions from oxyde.db import transaction async with transaction.atomic(): user = await User.objects.create(name=&quot;Bob&quot;, email=&quot;bob@example.com&quot;) # rollback on exception await db.close() </code></pre> <p>```</p> <p>FastAPI integration:</p> <p>```python from fastapi import FastAPI from oxyde import db</p> <p>app = FastAPI( lifespan=db.lifespan(default=&quot;postgresql://localhost/mydb&quot;) )</p> <p>@app.get(&quot;/users&quot;) async def get_users(): return await User.objects.filter(is_active=True).all() ```</p> <hr /> <h2>Benchmarks</h2> <p>Tested against popular ORMs: 7 ORMs x 3 databases x 24 tests.

Rather than just editing DOM via JS in console the agent is treating the page, and the DOM as a file.<p>The models are often trained in RL sandboxes with full access to the filesystem and bash, so they are really good at using it. So to make the agent behave well, I've simulated this environment.<p>The whole state of a page and scripts is implemented as a virtual filesystem hacked on top of browser.local storage. URL is mapped to directories, and the agent starts inside this directory. It has the tools to read/edit files, grep around and a fake bash command that is just used for running scripts and executing JS code.<p>I've tested only with Opus 4.5 so far, and it works pretty reliably.\nThe state of the file system can be synced to the real filesystem, although because Firefox doesn't support Filesystem API, you need to manually import the fs contents first.<p>This agent is <i>really</i> useful for extracting things to CSV, but it's also can be used for fun.<p>Demo: <a href=\"https://x.com/ichebykin/status/2015686974439608607\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://x.com/ichebykin/status/2015686974439608607</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46800484\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46800484</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just published the first alpha version of my new project: a minimal, highly consistent, portable and fast library for (contrast limited) (adaptive) histogram equalization of image arrays in Python. The heavily lifting is done in Rust. If you find this useful, please star it ! If you need some feature currently missing, or if you find a bug, please drop by the issue tracker. I want this to be as useful as possible to as many people as possible !</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/neutrinoceros/ahe\">https://github.com/neutrinoceros/ahe</a></p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Histogram Equalization is a common data-processing trick to improve visual contrast in an image. ahe supports 3 different algorithms: simple histogram equalization (HE), together with 2 variants of Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE), namely sliding-tile and tile-interpolation. Contrast limitation is supported for all three.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Data analysts, researchers dealing with images, including (but not restricted to) biologists, geologists, astronomers... as well as generative artists and photographers.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p><code>ahe</code> is designed as an alternative to <code>scikit-image</code> for the 2 functions it replaces: <code>skimage.exposure.equalize_(adapt)hist</code> Compared to its direct competition, <code>ahe</code> has better performance, portability, much smaller and portable binaries, and a much more consistent interface, all algorithms are exposed through a single function, making the feature set intrinsically cohesive. See the <code>README</code> for a much closer look at the differences.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chromium52\"> /u/chromium52 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qp94or/ahe_a_minimalist_imageprocessing_library_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qp94or/ahe_a_minimalist_imageprocessing_library_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I found myself writing this code every time I start a new project, so I made it a template.</p> <p>I wrote a pretty-descriptive guide on how it's structured in the README, it's basically <code>project.lib</code> for application support code, <code>project.db</code> for the ORM models and migrations, and <code>project.api</code> for the FastAPI code, route handlers, and Pydantic schemas.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>It's a starter template for writing FastAPI + Tortoise ORM code. Some key notes:</p> <ul> <li>Redoc by default, no swagger.</li> <li>Automatic markdown-based OpenAPI tag and API documentation from files in a directory.</li> <li>NanoID-based, includes some little types to help with that.</li> <li>The usual FastAPI.</li> <li>Error types and handlers bundled-in.</li> <li>Simple architecture. API, DB, and lib.</li> <li>Bundled-in .env settings support.</li> <li>A template not a framework, so it's all easily customizable.</li> </ul> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>It can be used anywhere. It's a template so you work on it and change everything as you like. It only lacks API versioning by default, which can always be added by creating <code>project.api.vX.*</code> modules, that's on you. I mean the template to be easy and simple for small-to-mid-sized projects, though again, it's a template so you work on it as you wish. Certainly beginner-friendly if you know ORM and FastAPI.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>I don't know about alternatives, this is what I came up with after a few times of making projects with this stack. There's different templates out there and you have your taste, so it depends on what you like your projects to look and feel like best.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Nekidev/uv-fastapi-tortoise\">https://github.com/Nekidev/uv-fastapi-tortoise</a></p> <p>My own Git: <a href=\"https://git.nyeki.dev/templates/uv-fastapi-tortoise\">https://git.nyeki.dev/templates/uv-fastapi-tortoise</a></p> <p>All suggestions are appreciated, issues and PRs too as always.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nekogi1\"> /u/Nekogi1 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpdnxn/uv_fastapi_tortoise_orm_template/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpdnxn/uv_fastapi_tortoise_orm_template/\">[comments]</a></span>",

After each solve, the solution x is tested for some properties and based on that <strong>c</strong> is updated using a few other transforms. <strong>A</strong> is updated and solved for <strong>x</strong> again. This goes for many iterations.</p> <p>While comparing the solution of <strong>x</strong> for different python versions, OSes, I noticed that the final solution <strong>x</strong> shows small differences which are not very problematic for the final goal of the library but makes testing quite challenging.</p> <p>For example, I use numpy's testing module : <a href=\"https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.testing.assert_allclose.html#numpy.testing.assert_allclose\">np.testing.assert_allclose</a> and it becomes fairly hard to judge the absolute and relative tolerances as expected deviation from the desired seems to fluctuate based on the python version. </p> <p>What is a good strategy while writing tests for such a library where I need to test if it converges to the correct solution? I am currently checking the norm of the solution, and using fairly generous tolerances for testing but I am open to better ideas.</p> <p>My second question is about benchmarking the library. To reduce the impact of other programs affecting the performance of the libray during the benchmark, is it advisable to to install the library in container using docker and do the benchmarking there, are there better strategies or am I missing something crucial?</p> <p>Thanks for any advice!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BawliTaread\"> /u/BawliTaread </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpb1ln/best_practices_while_testing_benchmarking_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpb1ln/best_practices_while_testing_benchmarking_a/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
    "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

Besides, has some good features as well:</p> <p>- Supports regular code editor + ipynb notebooks (you can upload your notebook and start working as well)</p> <p>- Works with Data science packages like pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn etc.</p> <p>- Can install PyPI packages on the fly with a button click.</p> <p>- Multiple files/tabs support</p> <p>- Export your notebooks to nicely formatted PDF or HTML (this is very handy personally).</p> <p>- Super fast and saves your work every 2 seconds, so your work wont be lost even if you refresh the page.</p> <p>Why I built it:</p> <p>People use python use online IDEs a lot but they are way too simple. Been using it myself for quick tests and teaching. Figured I'd share in case it's useful to anyone else. All client-side, so your code stays private.</p> <p>Would love any feedback or suggestions! Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Regular-Entrance-205\"> /u/Regular-Entrance-205 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qp6smf/i_built_a_python_ide_that_runs_completely_in_your/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qp6smf/i_built_a_python_ide_that_runs_completely_in_your/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Left-right asymmetry of the brain is well recognized in various animals including C. elegans, drosophila and zebrafish. In primates, most of the brain studies describe side of the brain. However, in spite of huge amounts of accumulating rodent studies on neuroscience, most of rodent studies do not distinguish the brain side. The pig brain is considered to occupy an intermediate position between primates and rodents in terms of structural complexity and brain function. Moreover, the numbers of studies using genetic manipulation of pigs are drastically increasing. So, we investigated microminipig (MMP) brain mesoscopic anatomy focusing on left-right differences of its morphology. Here, we show anterior cingulate cortex, perirhinal cortex, and cerebellum of MMP, are structurally asymmetrical. Anterior cingulate gurus exhibited protrusion and invagination toward the midline on the right and left side, respectively. The left perirhinal cortex has extra gyrus which are not observed on the right side. The cerebellar vermis, paravermis is tilted from the midline and the consequently the cerebellar cortex exhibits asymmetrical morphology. These data demonstrate that MMPs are one of the suitable model animals for investigating cerebral and cerebellar asymmetry.",

    "title": "Noninvasive and Objective Near Real-Time Detection of Pain Changes in Fluctuating Pain",
    "content": "Chronic pain involves natural intensity fluctuations that patients cannot control, contributing to learned helplessness and functional impairment. Detecting spontaneous pain decreases could enable precisely timed interventions that enhance perceived control. However, existing research on objective pain assessment has focused primarily on estimating static intensity from short, predictable stimuli rather than detecting moment-to-moment changes in ongoing pain. This study investigated whether pain decreases can be detected objectively using easily obtainable physiological signals during fluctuating pain. We recorded multiple physiological signals (8-channel EEG, electrodermal activity, heart rate, pupil diameter, facial expressions) from 42 healthy participants (M_age = 26.2 years, SD = 5.1) during calibrated tonic heat pain stimulation on the left forearm with unpredictable intensity fluctuations (0-70 on visual analogue scale; twelve 3-minute trials). Temperature changes lasted 5-20 seconds. Using minimal preprocessing suitable for real-time applications, we trained state-of-the-art deep learning models to classify pain decreases versus non-decreases from brief temporal windows on a held-out test set (9 participants). Combining electrodermal activity, heart rate, and pupil diameter yielded optimal classification performance using a transformer-based architecture (AUROC = 0.854, accuracy = 76.8%). Electrodermal activity emerged as the most informative single predictor. Continuous stream analysis demonstrated median detection latency of 5.75 seconds with 70.4% sensitivity, reducible to 4.25 seconds at the cost of increased false positives. Results indicate that electrodermal activity and heart rate enable straightforward practical deployment, while highly variable signals such as EEG and facial expressions require personalized fine-tuned models. These findings establish a basis for closed-loop interventions targeting spontaneous pain changes.",

    "title": "Neurogranin enhances spontaneous activity and neuronal survival of hippocampal neurons",
    "content": "Neurogranin (Ng) is a postsynaptic protein highly enriched in forebrain neurons and implicated in synaptic plasticity through its ability to bind calmodulin. However, its impact on neuronal development, network dynamics, and cellular homeostasis remains incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the effects of manipulating Ng expression in primary hippocampal neurons using viral gene delivery, with emphasis on structural, functional, and molecular outcomes. Restoring Ng expression to adult physiological levels enhanced dendritic growth, increased synaptic number, and induced a proximal shift of the axon initial segment, consistent with adaptive responses to increased connectivity. Functionally, Ng markedly increased spontaneous neuronal activity and network synchronization, even under culture conditions that normally show minimal baseline activity. Electrophysiological recordings revealed enhanced burst firing and spike synchrony, indicating strengthened functional coupling rather than increased membrane excitability. Ng-dependent activity required action potential firing and glutamatergic transmission. At the molecular level, Ng increased total calmodulin levels in a binding-dependent manner, reduced overall calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II abundance while enhancing its relative autophosphorylation, and selectively decreased both total and surface levels of ionotropic glutamate receptors. These changes are consistent with a coordinated homeostatic reorganization of calcium-dependent signaling. Despite robust increases in activity, Ng expression improved neuronal viability, reduced cellular stress markers, and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Active caspase-3 was selectively elevated without triggering apoptosis, suggesting a non-apoptotic role in activity-dependent structural remodeling. Together, these findings identify Ng as a homeostatic regulator that promotes coordinated network activity, adaptive synaptic remodeling, and neuronal survival.",

    "title": "Attention-like regulation of theta sweeps in the brain's spatial navigation circuit",
    "content": "Spatial attention supports navigation by prioritizing information from selected locations. A candidate neural mechanism is provided by theta-paced sweeps in grid- and place-cell population activity, which sample nearby space in a left-right-alternating pattern coordinated by parasubicular direction signals. During exploration, this alternation promotes uniform spatial coverage, but whether sweeps can be flexibly tuned to locations of particular interest remains unclear. Using large-scale Neuropixels recordings in freely-behaving rats, we show that sweeps and direction signals are rapidly and dynamically modulated: they track moving targets during pursuit, precede orienting responses during immobility, and reverse during backward locomotion -- without prior spatial learning. Similar modulation occurs during REM sleep. Canonical head-direction signals remain head-aligned. These findings identify sweeps as a flexible, attention-like mechanism for selectively sampling allocentric cognitive maps.",

    "title": "Heterogeneity in neural network engagement supports individual differences in top-down attention",
    "content": "Top-down attention enables selective prioritisation of goal-relevant information, yet how attentional control varies across individuals remains unclear, particularly in relation to sensory processing. Here, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometry--in older adults performing a spatial cueing task--to examine both shared and subject-specific aspects of top-down attention. Informative spatial cues elicited sustained activity in fronto-parietal and sensory regions, alpha lateralisation, and increased pupil dilation, replicating established neural and physiological markers. Crucially, these group-level patterns were accompanied by systematic intersubject variability: individuals with greater hearing loss showed increased preparatory engagement of precentral and postcentral gyri, and variation in pupil dilation predicted activity in frontal regions. These results reveal that top-down attention arises from heterogeneous network configurations shaped by sensory processing and strategic resource allocation. Overall, our findings underscore the need to move beyond group averages to capture the neural architecture underlying individual differences in top-down attention.",

    "title": "Reduced Pupil-Linked Arousal Marks Implicit Memory for Complex Auditory Sequences",
    "content": "Observers rapidly form long-lasting implicit memories for recurring sensory patterns, supporting adaptive behaviour through learning of environmental contingencies. Here we tested how such memories interact with neuromodulatory systems that regulate arousal - whether implicit familiarity increases arousal through retrieval-related processes or instead decreases arousal via more efficient sensory processing. We examined these competing accounts using complex auditory tone-pip sequences in which a subset of patterns recurred approximately every three minutes. One group of participants (N=30) actively detected transitions from random to regular structure, whereas a second group (N=40) heard the same sequences while performing a decoy task. Consistent with prior work, recurring regular sequences elicited faster reaction times in the active group, confirming the formation of implicit memory. Subsequently, both groups listened to previously encountered regular patterns (REGr) and matched novel regular patterns (REGn) while pupil diameter was recorded. Across groups, REGr sequences evoked significantly smaller pupil dilations than REGn sequences, indicating attenuated arousal for familiar patterns. This reduction was sustained until sequence offset in the active group but was transient in the exposure group, suggesting that task demands during exposure shape the stability of pupil-linked memory expression. Importantly, the REGr-REGn pupil difference did not correlate with explicit post-session recognition, demonstrating that the effect was not driven by conscious awareness. Together, these findings identify pupil dynamics as a robust physiological marker of learned auditory structure and show that implicit auditory sequence memory attenuates arousal. The results support predictive processing accounts in which familiarity reduces uncertainty and, consequently, neuromodulatory drive.",

    "title": "Parental state dynamically reshapes auditory processing of offspring vocalizations in zebra finches",
    "content": "Parental care is critical for offspring survival. For many species, including humans, auditory cues unique to dependent offspring, such as baby cries, elicit the necessary behavior from parents to care for young. Despite this, we know little about how the brain encodes auditory cues specific to offspring. Zebra finches are an excellent model to study this. Zebra finches are biparental, meaning both male and female parents raise the young and rely on auditory cues (begging calls) to elicit chick feeding responses (parental behavior). Begging calls also become individually identifiable by the parents, necessitating higher-order learning/ association neural processes. It is well established that the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), a higher-order region of secondary pallial cortex (analogous to the mammalian secondary auditory cortex), is involved in the perception of complex auditory signals in birds. It is unknown, however, if/how NCM responds to offspring begging calls. To begin testing this, we used high density silicon probes to record single-unit in vivo electrophysiology activity in the NCM of adult parenting and non-parenting zebra finches exposed to playbacks of their own chicks begging calls (parents only), novel age-matched begging calls (parents and non-parents), as well as novel adult male song and pure tone controls. Our results show that NCM neurons in parents respond more strongly (i.e., higher evoked firing rates) to both their own and novel chick begging calls and have higher baseline (spontaneous) firing rates in narrow spiking units relative to non-parents. Furthermore, NCM neurons in parenting females tend to show more selective responses towards their own chick begging calls, whereas those in males do not show similar levels of selectivity. These studies lay essential groundwork for future studies on how auditory responses can elicit parental behavior and how these responses may change over the chick-rearing period.",

    "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

    "title": "What are the virtual reality solutions for dual-task intervention to promote health in aging? A scoping review",
    "content": "IntroductionCognitive-motor dual-task (CMDT) performance is crucial for everyday activities, particularly in older adults who commonly experience deficiencies in cognitive and motor domains. These impairments compromise daily functioning, causing a decrease in quality of life. However, traditional assessment and training methods face significant limitations. Conventional protocols often exhibit limited ecological validity, as they fail to replicate real-world performance demands adequately. Moreover, they are characterized by substantial methodological heterogeneity and offer restricted capacity for real-time performance monitoring and the delivery of personalized feedback. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a promising approach by creating controlled, real-life environments that enable precise assessment and personalized training. However, VR-based CMDT remains largely unexplored. This review evaluates current VR solutions for CMDT, examining assessment, and intervention designs.MethodsA scoping review was conducted on April 17, 2023 (and updated on January 21, 2025), following the PRISMA for Scoping Review guidelines, on three databases: Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed. We included original articles, based on the following criteria: English-language; original research articles reporting empirical data from experimental, quasi-experimental, or observational studies; articles employing CMDT assessment or training; use of VR-based applications during a CMDT; older population participants (\u226565 years). Reviews, meta-analyses, editorials, conceptual articles, case studies, and short papers were excluded.ResultsOf 2,649 papers, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria: 17 assessment and four training studies. Research focused on healthy older adults and individuals with early cognitive decline, sensory deficits, and those at fall risk. Assessment studies mainly employed immersive and semi-immersive systems simulating realistic scenarios in virtual environments, primarily using \u201cwalking while\u201d paradigms with cognitive tasks. Training studies frequently utilized non-immersive or semi-immersive solutions with less naturalistic environments, demonstrating improvements in gait parameters, dual-task performance, motor functions, and cognitive abilities. Substantial methodological heterogeneity was observed in intervention duration, frequency, and DT cost calculations, with limited attention to user experience evaluation.DiscussionVR-based CMDT applications show promise for assessment and intervention in aging. However, significant gaps exist regarding the lack of standardized methodological approaches, ecological validity, and user-centered design considerations. Future research should address these limitations to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of VR-based CMDT interventions.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo compare demographics, comorbidities, neurologic symptoms, quality of life, and cognitive outcomes among adult individuals with neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) across countries with varying income levels: the United States (U.S.), Colombia, Nigeria, and India.MethodsIn this multi-country observational study, participants were evaluated in hospital clinics and recruited from institutional databases between 2020 and 2025. Patients were categorized as post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) or non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP). Cognitive assessments were performed using the NIH Toolbox (U.S. and Colombia), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Nigeria), or the Mini-Mental State Examination (India).ResultsA total of 3,157 participants were enrolled (652 PNP; 2,505 NNP). PNP patients were predominantly male except in the US, while NNP patients were predominantly female, except in India. The most frequent neurologic symptoms were brain fog, myalgia, dizziness, headache, and sensory disturbances, with frequency highest in the U.S. and lowest in India. There were significant differences for most neurologic and non-neurologic symptoms of PASC, driven by higher frequencies in U.S. and Colombia in both PNP and NNP cohorts. In addition, cognitive impairment measured with different instruments varied across countries for both PNP and NNP groups. Multiple correspondence analysis showed clustering of symptom burden between U.S./Colombia and Nigeria/India.ConclusionNeuro-PASC presents globally but symptom burden, and psychological distress vary across regions, likely influenced by sociocultural factors, healthcare access, and diagnostic tools. These findings highlight the need for culturally-adapted screening and post-COVID care worldwide.",

    "content": "Auditory perception and localization are fundamental tasks for many species, allowing them to detect, identify, and spatially localize sound sources in their environment. While biological systems have evolved sophisticated neural mechanisms for auditory adaptation, artificial auditory systems still struggle to match their performance, particularly in dynamic and noisy environments. Our research focuses on whether sensor adaptation, driven by efferent feedback from the processing stage to the sensory stage, can improve localization performance. Inspired by human sound source localization based on interaural level differences (ILD) and efferent feedback, the proposed neuromorphic system architecture is composed of two bio-inspired acoustic sensors connected to a neural processing stage, represented by two neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and two neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO). The LSO neuron response was analyzed in the following ways: (i) using measured sensor responses at different ILD without efferent feedback and with a fixed local feedback for each sensor measurement; (ii) simulated with synthetically generated sounds with varying ILDs for four different feedback configurations from the LSO neuron to the acoustic sensors. Results from (i) showed how the feedback tuning can be used to overcome mismatches due to fabrication tolerances between different MEMS sensors, and (ii) showed the influence of different feedback configurations and simulation parameters on the LSO neuron response with respect to different ILDs.",

    "title": "Altered static and dynamic functional network connectivity between subcortical nuclei and cortical regions of the default mode network in type 2 diabetes mellitus",
    "content": "IntroductionDisruptions in functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) are well established as a key neuropathology underlying cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Subcortical nuclei, including the basal forebrain (BF) and mediodorsal thalamus, play critical roles in regulating DMN-associated cognitive processes and are particularly vulnerable to hyperglycemia and brain insulin resistance. However, the specific FC patterns between these subcortical nuclei and DMN cortical regions in patients with T2DM, as well as their potential associations with cognitive impairment, remain incompletely elucidated.MethodsEighty-two patients with T2DM and 79 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were collected from all participants. Resting-state (rs-FNC) and dynamic (dFNC) functional network connectivity analyses were performed to characterize connectivity between subcortical nuclei and DMN cortical regions. Correlation analyses explored associations between FNC metrics showing significant intergroup differences and participants\u2019 clinical and cognitive parameters.Resultsrs-FNC analysis revealed decreased FC between the BF and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC), the BF and the temporal pole, and the dMPFC and the anteromedial prefrontal cortex in patients with T2DM (network-based statistic correction; edge p\u202f<\u202f0.001, component p\u202f<\u202f0.05). dFNC analyses indicated increased frequency and prolonged mean dwell time (MDT) of State 1 (high-frequency low-connectivity), as well as decreased frequency and shortened MDT of State 2 (high-frequency high-connectivity) compared with HCs (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Reduced FC between the dMPFC and BF was positively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r\u202f=\u202f0.353, p\u202f=\u202f0.001), whereas frequency (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.434, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and MDT (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.376, p\u202f=\u202f0.001) of State 2 were negatively correlated with T2DM disease duration after Bonferroni correction.ConclusionThese findings indicate that T2DM duration correlates with reduced highly efficient DMN connectivity, and that the BF may regulate cognitive function via the dMPFC subsystem. The results reveal temporal and functional specificity in abnormal DMN connectivity in patients with T2DM and enrich the neural atlas of DMN dysfunction in this population.",

    "title": "Dynamic mode decomposition of resting-state fMRI revealing abnormal brain region features in schizophrenia",
    "content": "Extracting features from abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia patients\u2019 brain images holds significant importance for aiding diagnosis. However, existing methods remained limited in simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal information. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from dynamic systems, making it suitable for time-series signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). This study utilized resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy subjects and 68 schizophrenia patients. The DMD method was employed to extract the mean amplitude of dynamic patterns as features, with feature selection conducted via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. A support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to validate the predictive capability of the selected features across subject groups. Based on the LASSO screening, we identified brain regions exhibiting significant inter-group differences in mean amplitude, designated these as abnormal regions, and subsequently analyzed their functional deviations. The DMD method not only provided explicit temporal dynamic representations of brain activity but also supported signal reconstruction and prediction, thereby enhancing feature interpretability. Results demonstrated that DMD effectively extracted mean amplitude features from fMRI data. Combined with LASSO and SVM, it enabled the identification of abnormal brain regions and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, this method captured frequency-dependent signal patterns, with extracted features correlating with both regional activation intensity and functional connectivity. This approach provides novel insights for exploring potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.",

    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder.

Prior olfactory interfaces rely on designer triggers and fixed event-to-odor mappings that do not scale to unconstrained content. This work examines whether semantic planning for smell is intelligible to people before physical scent delivery. We present a video-to-scent planning pipeline that separates visual semantic extraction using a vision-language model from semantic-to-olfactory inference using a large language model. Two survey studies compare system-generated scent plans with over-inclusive and naive baselines. Results show consistent preference for plans that prioritize perceptually salient cues and align scent changes with visible actions, supporting semantic planning as a foundation for future olfactory media systems.",

To understand the information needed for UI generation, we conducted a thematic analysis of UI prompting guidelines, identifying key design semantics and discovering that they are hierarchical and interdependent. Leveraging these findings, we developed a system that enables users to specify semantics, visualize relationships, and extract how semantics are reflected in generated UIs. By making semantics serve as an intermediate representation between human intent and AI output, our system bridges both gulfs by making requirements explicit and outcomes interpretable. A comparative user study suggests that our approach enhances users' perceived control over intent expression, outcome interpretation, and facilitates more predictable, iterative refinement. Our work demonstrates how explicit semantic representation enables systematic and explainable exploration of design possibilities in AI-driven UI design.",

More accessible alternatives often do not scale in complexity, cost to produce, or both. Motivated by a recent shift to tools for creating visual diagrams from code, we propose a solution that automatically creates accessible representations from structural information about diagrams. Based on a Wizard-of-Oz study, we derive design requirements for an automated system, Arboretum, that compiles text-based diagram specifications into three synchronized nonvisual formats$\\unicode{x2013}$tabular, navigable, and tactile. Our evaluation with BVI users highlights the strength of tactile graphics for complex tasks such as binary search; the benefits of offering multiple, complementary nonvisual representations; and limitations of existing digital navigation patterns for structural reasoning. This work reframes access to data structures by preserving their structural properties. The solution is a practical system to advance accessible CS education.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can support design work, but often provide generic, one-off suggestions that limit reflective engagement. We investigate how to guide LLMs to act as design mentors by applying the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model, which emphasizes demonstrating reasoning through six methods: modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration. We operationalize these instructional methods through structured prompting and evaluate them in a within-subjects study with data visualization practitioners. Participants interacted with both a baseline LLM and an instructional LLM designed with cognitive apprenticeship prompts. Surveys, interviews, and conversational log analyses compared experiences across conditions. Our findings show that cognitively informed prompts elicit deeper design reasoning and more reflective feedback exchanges, though the baseline is sometimes preferred depending on task types or experience levels. We distill design considerations for AI-assisted feedback systems that foster reflective practice.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.19021v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Research with dementia caregivers poses persistent methodological and ethical challenges, particularly when interview-based studies are designed without sufficient grounding in lived caregiving realities. Questions framed through clinical or deficit-oriented assumptions risk alienating participants, undermining rapport, and producing shallow or ethically fraught data. While human-computer interaction (HCI) research increasingly adopts participatory approaches in technology design, participation rarely extends to the design of research methods themselves. This paper examines the role of lived-experience advisors as methodological partners in caregiver interview research. We report on a qualitative study in which two advisors with extensive dementia caregiving experience were engaged prior to fieldwork as methodological partners, extending participatory principles beyond technology design into the design of research methods themselves. Drawing on transcripts of advisor consultations and subsequent interviews with ten caregivers and one person living with dementia, we identify two key methodological contributions of advisor involvement. First, advisors enabled anticipatory validity by surfacing caregiving challenges, ethical sensitivities, and interpretive concerns that later appeared in caregiver interviews, allowing the researcher to enter the field with grounded awareness under constrained recruitment and fieldwork conditions. Second, advisors provided cultural, emotional, and systemic context that improved interpretive sensitivity and helped avoid misreadings. We argue that lived experience functions as methodological infrastructure, extending participatory principles into the design and conduct of research itself, and constituting a generalizable methodological pattern for HCI research with caregivers and other vulnerable or marginalized populations.",

A pilot study involving six participants compared two synthesis methods, leading us to adopt a filter-based approach for smoother and more realistic feedback. A subsequent study with sixteen participants evaluated four conditions: no-feedback, controller, humanoid+controller, and human+controller. Results showed that humanoid feedback enhanced immersion, realism, and enjoyment, while introducing moderate costs in terms of comfort and simulation sickness. Interviews further highlighted the robot's consistency and predictability in contrast to the adaptability of human feedback.

    "content": "arXiv:2601.18966v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Users trust algorithms more when they can predict the algorithms' behavior. Simple algorithms trivially yield predictively accurate mental models, but modern AI algorithms have often been assumed too complex for people to build predictive mental models, especially in the social media domain. In this paper, we describe conditions under which even complex algorithms can yield predictive mental models, opening up opportunities for a broader set of human-centered algorithms. We theorize that users will form an accurate predictive mental model of an algorithm's behavior if and only if the algorithm simultaneously satisfies three criteria: (1) cognitive availability of the underlying concepts being modeled, (2) concept compactness (does it form a single cognitive construct?), and (3) high alignment between the person's and algorithm's execution of the concept. We evaluate this theory through a pre-registered experiment (N=1250) where users predict behavior of 25 social media feed ranking algorithms that vary on these criteria. We find that even complex (e.g., LLM-based) algorithms enjoy accurate prediction rates when they meet all criteria, and even simple (e.g., basic term count) algorithms fail to be predictable when a single criterion fails. We also find that these criteria determine outcomes beyond prediction accuracy, such as which mental models users deploy to make their predictions.",

Participants confess secrets to a water surface, triggering a four-phase ritual: confession, contemplation, response, and release. The user's speech sentiment is directly transmitted into the water to prime its state, while semantic content enters a multi-agent system, initiating ripples of conversation where agent identities are situated through discourse and voice profiles are chosen based on what they say. We propose a novel algorithm that decomposes speech into component waves and reconstructs them in water, establishing a translation between speech and the physics of material form. By rendering machine reasoning as emergent physical phenomena, the installation explores possibilities for emotional self-exploration through ambiguous, sensory-rich interfaces.",

    "content": "arXiv:2507.14056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the stability gap -- a temporary performance drop on previously learned tasks when new ones are introduced. This phenomenon reflects a mismatch between rapid adaptation and strong retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need for optimization mechanisms that balance plasticity and stability over abrupt distribution changes. While optimizers such as momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit multi-timescale behavior, they still exhibit pronounced stability gaps. Importantly, these gaps persist even under ideal joint training, making it crucial to study them in this setting to isolate their causes from other sources of forgetting. Motivated by how noradrenergic (neuromodulatory) bursts transiently increase neuronal gain under uncertainty, we introduce a dynamic gain scaling mechanism as a two-timescale optimization technique that balances adaptation and retention by modulating effective learning rates and flattening the local landscape through an effective reparameterization. Across domain- and class-incremental MNIST, CIFAR, and mini-ImageNet benchmarks under task-agnostic joint training, dynamic gain scaling effectively attenuates stability gaps while maintaining competitive accuracy, improving robustness at task transitions.",

The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario.

Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.",

Otherwise, we humans would be inexplicably, implausibly lucky to have consciousness, while similarly behaviorally sophisticated entities elsewhere would be mere shells, devoid of consciousness. However, this Copernican default assumption is canceled in the case of behaviorally sophisticated entities designed to mimic superficial features associated with consciousness (\"consciousness mimics\"), and in particular a broad class of current, near-future, and hypothetical robots. These considerations, which we formulate, respectively, as the Copernican and Mimicry Arguments, jointly defeat an otherwise potentially attractive parity principle, according to which we should apply the same types of behavioral or cognitive tests to aliens and robots, attributing or denying consciousness similarly to the extent they perform similarly. Our approach is unusual in the following respect: Instead of grounding speculations about alien and robot consciousness in a particular metaphysical or scientific theory about the physical or functional bases of consciousness, we appeal directly to the epistemic principles of Copernican mediocrity and inference to the best explanation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.19125v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visual illusions provide a window into the mechanisms underlying visual processing, and dynamical neural circuit models offer a natural framework for proposing and testing theories of their emergence. We propose and analyze a delay-coupled neural field model that explains stroboscopic percepts arising from the subsampling of a moving, often rotating, stimulus, such as the wagon-wheel illusion. Motivated by the role of activity propagation delays in shaping visual percepts, we study neural fields with both uniform and spatially dependent delays, representing the finite time required for signals to travel along axonal projections. Each module is organized as a ring of neurons encoding angular preference, with instantaneous local coupling and delayed long-range coupling strongest between neurons with similar preference. We show that delays generate a family of coexisting traveling bump solutions with distinct, quantized propagation speeds. Using interface-based asymptotic methods, we reduce the neural field dynamics to a low-dimensional system of coupled delay differential equations, enabling a detailed analysis of speed selection, stability, entrainment, and state transitions. Regularly pulsed inputs induce transitions between distinct speed states, including motion opposite to the forcing direction, capturing key features of visual aliasing and stroboscopic motion reversal. These results demonstrate how delayed neural interactions organize perception into discrete dynamical states and provide a mechanistic explanation for stroboscopic visual illusions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2601.19019v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recurrent neural networks trained for time-series prediction often develop latent trajectories that preserve qualitative structure of the dynamical systems generating their inputs. Recent empirical work has documented topology-preserving latent organization in trained recurrent models, and recent theoretical results in reservoir computing establish conditions under which the synchronization map is an embedding. Here we synthesize these threads into a unified account of when contracting recurrent networks yield smooth, topology-preserving internal representations for a broad and biologically relevant class of inputs: regular dynamics on invariant circles and tori.\n  Our contribution is an integrated framework that assembles (i) generalized synchronization and embedding guarantees for contracting reservoirs, (ii) regularity mechanisms ensuring differentiability of the synchronization map under mild constraints, and (iii) a base-system viewpoint in which the invariant manifold generating the input stream is treated as the driving system. In this regular setting, the conditions commonly viewed as restrictive in chaotic-attractor analyses become mild and readily satisfied by standard contractive architectures. The framework clarifies how representational content in recurrent circuits is inherently historical: the network state encodes finite windows of input history rather than instantaneous stimuli.\n  By consolidating disparate empirical and theoretical results under common assumptions, the synthesis yields concrete, testable expectations about when prediction-trained recurrent circuits should (or should not) form smooth latent embeddings and how required state dimension scales with the intrinsic dimension of the driving dynamics.",

    "title": "Schema-based active inference supports rapid generalization of experience and frontal cortical coding of abstract structure",
    "content": "arXiv:2601.18946v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Schemas -- abstract relational structures that capture the commonalities across experiences -- are thought to underlie humans' and animals' ability to rapidly generalize knowledge, rebind new experiences to existing structures, and flexibly adapt behavior across contexts. Despite their central role in cognition, the computational principles and neural mechanisms supporting schema formation and use remain elusive. Here, we introduce schema-based hierarchical active inference (S-HAI), a novel computational framework that combines predictive processing and active inference with schema-based mechanisms. In S-HAI, a higher-level generative model encodes abstract task structure, while a lower-level model encodes spatial navigation, with the two levels linked by a grounding likelihood that maps abstract goals to physical locations. Through a series of simulations, we show that S-HAI reproduces key behavioral signatures of rapid schema-based generalization in spatial navigation tasks, including the ability to flexibly remap abstract schemas onto novel contexts, resolve goal ambiguity, and balance reuse versus accommodation of novel mappings. Crucially, S-HAI also reproduces prominent neural codes reported in rodent medial prefrontal cortex during a schema-dependent navigation and decision task, including task-invariant goal-progress cells, goal-identity cells, and goal-and-spatially conjunctive cells, as well as place-like codes at the lower level. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic account of schema-based learning and inference that bridges behavior, neural data, and theory. More broadly, our findings suggest that schema formation and generalization may arise from predictive processing principles implemented hierarchically across cortical and hippocampal circuits, enabling the generalization of experience.",

The convergence of these properties across the datasets hints at universal neural behavior. Yet, it is unknown how differences in temporal resolution and measurement details affect pRG scaling. Here, we use a network model known to produce scaling under pRG analysis as a testbed to assess how recording and analysis choices shape inferred scaling exponents. We show that scaling properties depend on the choices of temporal binning, measurement nonlinearities, and deconvolution, and that the quality of scaling for cluster covariance eigenvalues is particularly sensitive to measurement effects. Moreover, all scaling exponents shift substantially with these transformations, even when the underlying neural dynamics are identical. Together, these results show how experimental choices can change pRG scaling and provide a framework for separating scaling driven by neural dynamics from that introduced by the recording method.",

    "title": "The cortical contribution to the speech-FFR is not modulated by visual information",
    "content": "Seeing a speaker's face can significantly aid understanding, particularly in challenging acoustic environments. An early neural response implicated in audiovisual speech processing is the frequency-following response (speech-FFR), which occurs at the fundamental frequency of the speech signal. This response arises from both subcortical areas and the auditory cortex. Previous studies have shown that subcortical responses are reduced when bimodal stimulation includes visual input from the talker's face. Here, we examined the cortical contribution to the speech-FFR and its potential modulation by visual information. We recorded MEG responses to four types of audiovisual signals: a still image, an artificially generated avatar, a degraded video, and a natural video. The audio stimuli were presented in a substantial level of background noise to make behavioral audiovisual effects stand out. Speech-in-noise comprehension increased significantly from the audio-only condition to the avatar and the degraded video, and further to the natural video. Moreover, we found that all types of audiovisual stimuli yielded robust speech-FFRs in the auditory cortex at an early latency of around 30ms. However, the magnitude of this neural response was neither enhanced nor attenuated by the videos, nor could the cortical contribution of the speech-FFR explain a significant portion of the variance in the behavioral comprehension scores. Our results suggest that visual modulation of the speech-FFR in the auditory cortex is, if existent, too small to be measurable in scenarios where speech occurs in considerable background noise.",

    "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "content": "IntroductionMaternal and child undernutrition are linked to atypical brain development in children. Provision of pre- and post-natal small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) has been shown to positively impact children\u2019s growth and development. It is unknown, however, whether SQ-LNS affects child brain morphology.MethodsThe present study used data from the International Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements randomized controlled trial in Ghana. Participants were 231 children (Mage = 10.6 years; 49.4% female) exposed to maternal iron and folic acid supplements prenatally (n = 113, control group) or maternal SQ-LNS prenatally until 6 mo postpartum and child SQ-LNS from age 6 to 18 months (n = 118, SQ-LNS group). Children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain anatomy. Primary outcomes were total gray matter volume, cortical gray matter thickness, and cortical gray matter volume assessed with whole-brain analyses. Secondary outcomes were thickness and volume of a priori specified cortical and subcortical regions assessed with region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. Basic and full covariate models were tested and corrected for multiple comparisons.ResultsWhole-brain analyses revealed no significant differences between groups in total gray matter volume or cortical gray matter thickness or volume. Cortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater right caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) thickness [mean (95%CI): 2.78 (2.73, 2.84) vs. 2.72 (2.67, 2.77); effect size = 0.21] and reduced left rostral ACC volume [2575.1 (2477.3, 2672.8) vs. 2678.74 (2568.7, 2788.8); effect size = 0.18]. Subcortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater volume of the left pallidus [1794.45 (1759.10, 1829.80) vs. 1726.13 (1685.05, 1767.21); effect size = 0.33] and right nucleus accumbens [751.54 (729.83, 773.24) vs. 705.73 (684.21, 727.24); effect size = 0.39]. Significant group differences did not hold after correction for multiple comparisons.DiscussionIn this cohort, pre- and post-natal SQ-LNS supplementation did not significantly alter total or cortical gray matter thickness and volume at 10 years, though secondary ROI analyses indicated subtle, non-robust differences in selected regions.",

    "content": "Unlike most adult mammals, regenerative vertebrates can awaken dormant neural stem cells in response to injury. Understanding how this process is regulated could guide strategies to activate stem cells for tissue repair and limit aberrant proliferation in cancers of the CNS. Here, using zebrafish injury models and high-speed live imaging, we identify hydrodynamically-activated Ca2+; signalling as a key driver of neural stem cell activation. Local injury-associated changes in CSF flow activate mechanoreceptors at the site of spinal cord lesions, triggering pulsatile Ca2+ activity and progenitor proliferation. We identify Ca2+-regulated peptidylarginine deiminase enzymes (PADs) as key downstream effectors that citrullinate intracellular targets in a Ca2+-dependent manner to drive progenitor activation. Finally, we show that PAD inhibitors suppress the growth of aggressive medulloblastoma cells in preclinical laboratory models. Together, these findings uncover a novel mechanism of proliferation control in the vertebrate CNS and highlight the value of regenerative studies for identifying therapeutic targets.",

    "title": "Precision in Motion: Reactive and Anticipatory Control of Mouse Tongue Movement for Interception",
    "content": "The ability to perform high precision motor actions to intercept moving objects is fundamental to animal motor behavior, whereby organisms must constantly adapt to a dynamic environment. Such interception tasks rely on tightly integrating predictive internal models and moment-to-moment sensory feedback, a hallmark of complex sensorimotor transformations. Studying interception behavior thus offers a unique window into how the brain flexibly coordinates perception and action in real time. However, traditional behavioral paradigms to study sensorimotor control in head fixed mice, often rooted in classical conditioning, simplify these complex processes into predictable, rigid stimulus response routines. Consequently, these paradigms fail to capture key ethological features of interception, such as the continuous dynamic nature of sensory input and direct physical interaction with moving objects. Our task bridges this gap by integrating naturalistic elements of interceptive behavior with precise experimental control. We introduce a behavioral task in which head fixed mice use their tongue to intercept a food pellet moving at constant speeds, randomly changing from trial to trial. We describe details of the 3D kinematics of discrete tongue reaching movements, their distinctive motor phases, and their learning dependent changes in onset and kinematics. We show that mice adjust their tongue kinematics and movement onset relative to varying pellet speeds, using distinctive reactive and anticipatory strategies. We demonstrate that the anticipatory strategy depends partially on vision and on intact lateral cerebellar circuits. Our novel behavioral paradigm is a valuable tool for exploring the neural basis of sensory motor transformation during object interception in head-fixed mice.",

    "title": "Data-Driven Retrieval of Effective Point Spread Functions for Super-Resolution Optoacoustic Imaging",
    "content": "Localization-based super-resolution techniques have revolutionized biomedical imaging by surpassing classical diffraction limits. However, their performance is fundamentally constrained by distortions of the point spread function (PSF) induced by the system and the sample, which are particularly prominent in the case of spatially under-sampling. Here we introduce a data-driven effective point spread function retrieval (DEPR) method that directly learns continuous, field-dependent system responses from experimental point source datasets. Through statistical aggregation of thousands of targets and iterative self-supervised refinement, DEPR captures spatially variant imaging characteristics in situ without prior assumptions or external calibrations.When integrated into the localization optoacoustic tomography (LOT) pipeline, DEPR achieves accurate sub-pixel localization despite under-sampled conditions, thus enhancing resolution while reducing computational burden. We demonstrate its efficacy by in vivo imaging of the murine brain microvasculature using microparticle contrast agents in the first (NIR-I) and second (NIR-II) near-infrared windows, achieving significant improvement in data utilization efficiency and substantial reduction of gridded artifacts compared to conventional approaches. The method resolves vascular structures with ~41 m separation across a ~3 mm imaging depth range. This framework addresses fundamental challenges shared across diverse localization-based imaging modalities, offering a robust and generalizable strategy for high-precision imaging in complex biological systems.",

    "title": "A brain dynamic model based on graph neural network reflect the inter-region interaction of cortical areas",
    "content": "A central objective in neuroscience is to elucidate how the brain generates complex dynamic activity through the interactions of brain areas. In this study, we utilized Interaction Network, a graph neural network model, to develop a computational framework for predicting whole-brain cortical blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals. We derived an Inter-Regional Interaction (IRI) metric to quantify information exchange among brain areas probing the underlying dynamical mechanisms. In addition, the total IRI emitted from each brain region was calculated and defined as the IRI sent by region (RS-IRI). Our model predicted the following 10 time points BOLD activity from initial BOLD signals, and achieved a mean absolute error of 0.04. The predicted functional connectivity (FC) achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.97 compared to the empirical FC. The fluctuation amplitude of the IRI increases with the length of the connection and the largest RS-IRI oscillation amplitude is observed in visual areas. The RS-IRI demonstrates a hierarchical organization, characterized by more concentrated distributions in association regions and larger fluctuation amplitudes in unimodal regions. Applying our approach to Alzheimers disease (AD), we demonstrate that the frequency-specific amplitudes of IRI oscillations discriminate AD patients from healthy controls and correlate with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Together, this work presents a deep learning-based framework for modeling brain dynamics as well a quantitative index of inter-areal interactions, and offers a new perspective for disease characterization.",

    "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
    "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

    "title": "Electro-Calcium uncoupling precedes neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease",
    "content": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is categorized as a neurodegenerative disease, but there is a growing recognition of the vascular components in AD pathophysiology. Reduction in cerebral perfusion is routinely observed in AD patients and preclinical models prior to overt clinical symptoms. However, there is a limited mechanistic understanding of the early neurovascular deficits in AD, and how these may ultimately contribute to pathology. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of early neurovascular dysfunction in AD by using 3-month-old 5xFAD mice, a familial mouse model of AD. Functional hyperemia-the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to neuronal activity-is driven by inward rectifier K+ (Kir2.1)-mediated hyperpolarizing (electrical) signals and Ca2+-dependent nitric oxide production within the capillary endothelial cells (cECs). Electrical and Ca2+ signals are tightly coupled through cECs membrane potential, referred to as Electro-Calcium (E- Ca) coupling. We hypothesize that E-Ca uncoupling contributes to impaired functional hyperemia in 5xFAD mice and that these neurovascular deficits precede the neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. At three months of age, 5xFAD mice did not exhibit any impairment in spatial learning and memory, or neuronal density. However, whisker stimulation-induced functional hyperemia was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice compared to controls. Functional hyperemia exhibited a bimodal response in controls-consisting of fast and slow phases-with the slow phase being significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice. To identify mechanisms underlying these deficits, we measured cortical neuronal and endothelial Ca2+ activity using in-vivo imaging. Neuronal Ca2+ activity was comparable between controls and 5xFAD mice, while cECs Ca2+ activity was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, Kir2.1 channel blocker, barium (100 M) significantly suppressed cECs Ca2+ activity in controls, but not in 5xFAD mice, consistent with crippled E-Ca coupling. Despite these vascular functional impairments, capillary density was preserved in 5xFAD mice. TRPV4 channels are one of the major Ca2+ entry pathways in cECs and potentiate E-Ca coupling. cECs TRPV4 current density was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice while Kir2.1 current density was unchanged, indicating that impaired TRPV4 function underlies the E-Ca uncoupling. In summary, early E-Ca uncoupling leads to impaired functional hyperemia in 5xFAD mice and may contribute to later neuronal and cognitive decline.",

    "title": "Translational regulation of GAD1 identified by circadian and light-responsive ribosome-bound transcriptome analysis in the mouse hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus",
    "content": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the master circadian pacemaker, integrating photic information to synchronize daily rhythms throughout the body. While transcriptional regulation of clock genes in the SCN has been extensively studied, whether gene expression in the SCN is regulated at the level of mRNA translation has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the first ribosome-profiling (Ribo-seq) dataset generated from the mouse SCN, enabling a genome-wide assessment of translational regulation in this central circadian clock. Combined time-series Ribo-seq and RNA-seq analyses identified 385 genes that exhibit rhythmic ribosome binding without corresponding oscillations in mRNA abundance, revealing widespread translational regulation in the SCN. Among these, light stimulation induced an approximately twofold increase in ribosome binding of Gad1, which encodes the major GABA-synthetic enzyme Gad67, despite only marginal changes in Gad1 mRNA levels. Importantly, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated light-dependent accumulation of Gad67 protein selectively in light-activated SCN neurons, establishing that translational regulation of Gad1 gives rise to overt protein-level changes. In contrast, canonical clock genes were regulated predominantly at the transcriptional level and showed little evidence of translational modulation. Our data allow a systematic comparison between transcriptionally and translationally regulated genes, including their relative rhythm-amplitudes and phases, and thereby revealed translational control as a distinct modulatory layer shaping time-of-day-dependent and light-dependent gene expression in the SCN.",

    "title": "The impact of dynamic reversal potential on the evolution of action potential attributes during spike trains",
    "content": "Action potentials (AP) are the basic elements of information processing in the nervous system. Understanding AP generation mechanisms is a critical step to understand how neurons encode information. However, an individual neuron might fire APs with various shapes even in response to the same stimulus, and the mechanisms responsible for this variability remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed four AP attributes including AP rapidity and threshold during consecutive bursts from three neuron types using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. In response to consecutive current steps, the AP attributes in evoked spike trains show two distinctive patterns across different neurons: (1) The first APs from each train always have comparable properties regardless of the stimulus strength; (2) The attributes of the subsequent APs during each pulse monotonically change during the burst, where the magnitude of AP attribute change during each pulse increases with increasing stimulation strength. Various conductance-based models were explored to determine if they replicated the observed AP bursts. The observed patterns could not be replicated using the classical HH-type models, or modified HH model with cooperative Na+ gating. However, adding ion concentration dynamics to the model reproduced the AP attribute variation, and the magnitude of change during a pulse correlated with change in dynamic reversal potential (DRP), but failed to replicate the first AP attributes pattern. Then, the role of cooperative Na+ gating on neuronal firing dynamics was investigated. Inclusion of cooperative gating restored the first APs\u2019 attributes and enhanced the magnitude of modeled variation of some AP attributes to better agree with observed data. We conclude that changes in local ion concentrations could be responsible for the monotonic change in APs attributes during neuronal bursts, and cooperative gating of Na+ channels can enhance the effect. Thus, the two mechanisms could contribute to the observed variability in neuronal response.",

    "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
    "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

    "title": "AMANet: a data-augmented multi-scale temporal attention convolutional network for motor imagery classification",
    "content": "Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interface (MI-BCI) has garnered considerable attention due to its potential for neural plasticity. However, the limited number of MI-EEG samples per subject and the susceptibility of features to noise and artifacts posed significant challenges for achieving high decoding performance. To address this problem, a Data-Augmented Multi-Scale Temporal Attention Convolutional Network (AMANet) was proposed. The network mainly consisted of four modules. First, the data augmentation module comprises three steps: sliding-window segmentation to increase sample size, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) extraction of discriminative spatial features, and linear scaling to enhance network robustness. Then, multi-scale temporal convolution was incorporated to dynamically extract temporal and spatial features. Subsequently, the ECA attention mechanism was integrated to realize the adaptive adjustment of the weights of different channels. Finally, depthwise separable convolution was utilized to fully integrate and classify the deep extraction of temporal and spatial features. In 10-fold cross-validation, the results show that AMANet achieves classification accuracies of 84.06 and 85.09% on the BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b, respectively, significantly outperforming baseline models such as Incep-EEGNet. On the High-Gamma dataset, AMANet attains a classification accuracy of 95.48%. These results demonstrate the excellent performance of AMANet in motor imagery decoding tasks.",

    "content": "Objective. Single-trial measurement of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting its use in real-time neurorehabilitation applications. We describe and evaluate methodological optimizations for eliciting reliable median nerve SEPs measurable in real time, with reduced reliance on post-processing. Methods. In twelve healthy participants, two sessions each, SEPs were assessed at three pulse widths (0.1, 0.5, 1 ms), at a low-frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz \u00b1 10%), and at an intensity sufficient to evoke consistent and robust sensory nerve action potentials and compound muscle action potentials. The evoked potential operant conditioning system platform was used to monitor responses in real time. Feasibility was also evaluated in a participant with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Results. SEP P50 and N70 were reliably elicited in healthy participants, and in individual with iSCI, across all tested pulse widths with minimal discomfort. N70 amplitude increased significantly with pulse width ( = 17.64, p = 0.0001, w = 0.80), while P50 amplitude remained unchanged. SNR showed a significant pulse width-dependent increase ( = 7.82, p = 0.02, w = 0.35) with improvements of 40% and 52% at 0.5 and 1 ms, respectively. N70 single-trial separability significantly improved at 1 ms (AUC of 0.83, = 8.17, p= 0.017), including the iSCI participant (0.84\u2013less impaired hand, 0.79\u2013more impaired hand). Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70\u20130.84, p < 0.05) was highest at 0.5 ms, indicating more consistent N70 and P50 measurements across sessions at a longer pulse width. Significance. Robust median nerve SEPs can be measured at single trials with methodological optimizations such as a longer pulse width (0.5\u20131 ms), low frequency (0.5 Hz), a consistent afferent excitation guided by nerve and muscle responses, and a robust EEG acquisition system. This setup can be useful for real time SEP-based brain computer interface applications for rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Objective: This article aimed to examine the psychometric properties of a measure of youth fear-avoidance of concussive symptoms. Method: Fear-avoidance is thought to be a risk factor for prolonged concussion recovery; however, current measures of fear-avoidance focus on pain rather than broader symptoms. We adapted the Fear of Pain Questionnaire to be relevant to concussion symptoms with a new version called the Fear of Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire (FOCSQ). We assessed the psychometrics of this scale with a sample of <em>N</em> = 115 youth with persistent postconcussive symptoms (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 15.1 years, 58% female, 70% non-Hispanic White, 15% Hispanic, <em>M</em> = 79.2 days since injury), including reliability, construct validity, and cross-informant reliability. Results: Exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor model was a good fit for youth report (fear and avoidance) and a three-factor model for parent proxy (fear, school/social avoidance, and movement avoidance). Reliability was excellent, with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for both youth report and parent proxy of 0.93 (95% CI [0.91, 0.95]). Construct validity indicated moderate correlation between youth-report FOCSQ and concussive symptoms 0.55 (95% CI [0.41, 0.66]), headache severity 0.37 (95% CI [0.19, 0.53]), depression 0.62 (95% CI [0.49, 0.72]), and anxiety 0.64 (95% CI [0.51, 0.73]). Criterion-related validity was supported by an inverse correlation between FOCSQ and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory: \u22120.64 (95% CI [\u22120.74, \u22120.52]). Youth report and parent proxy were moderately correlated, with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient <em>r</em> = 0.60 (95% CI [0.47, 0.71]). Conclusions: The FOCSQ is a reliable and valid measure of fear-avoidance in youth with concussion, and future research might explore whether this measure could be used to identify youth at risk for prolonged recovery.

    "title": "Phonological networks remain intact in multiple sclerosis.",
    "content": "Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition characterized by white and gray matter decline that leads to slower motor function and cognitive impairment. Although language remains relatively intact, individuals with MS often have word retrieval difficulties. Previous research suggests that these difficulties may be related to vocabulary, the number of words an individual knows, and other semantic aspects of language. However, few studies have examined phonological aspects of speech. Method: We examined speech in 89 individuals with MS and 88 age-matched neurotypical adults using a phonemic verbal fluency task. We took a network science approach, building a phonological network from participants\u2019 responses and their close phonological neighbors. We then examined the local network characteristics (degree, clustering coefficient) of participants\u2019 responses to assess whether responses differed between the groups. Results: Although individuals with MS produced fewer responses during the task, the network characteristics of their responses were similar to neurotypical adults, the control group. Moreover, lexical characteristics such as word length and lexical frequency were also similar between groups (model <em>R</em>\u00b2 values < 1%). Finally, a forward flow analysis, which quantifies the phonological similarity between adjacent responses and provides a metric of how people search phonemic space, did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that phonological aspects of speech remain stable in individuals with MS. Word retrieval difficulties in MS may arise from neurological changes in semantic processes, in combination with other cognitive abilities such as speed of processing and executive function, which are common in MS.

    "title": "Pathological TDP-43 filaments accumulate at synapses and cause synaptic dysfunction",
    "content": "The assembly of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) into amyloid filaments within neurons is a hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including motor neuron diseases (MND), frontotemporal dementias (FTD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). These diseases result from the deterioration and loss of neurons, with synaptic dysfunction and neuronal hyperexcitability being prominent early events. Pathogenic mutations in the TDP-43 gene, TARDBP, that promote filament formation have established a causal role for TDP-43 assembly in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying filament accumulation and their contribution to neurodegeneration are poorly understood. TDP-43 filaments can propagate between neurons in a prion-like manner, which may underlie the progressive spread and accumulation of TDP-43 pathology in disease. Here, we studied early stages of TDP-43 filament accumulation following internalisation of patient-derived TDP-43 filaments by mouse and human cortical neurons. Using proximity labelling, we identified molecular environments and putative interactions of TDP-43 filaments. We found that TDP-43 filaments accumulated at synapses, particularly in proximity to the presynaptic active zone, which we confirmed in FTD patient brain sections. Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) directly visualised abundant TDP-43 filaments spanning the presynaptic cytoplasm in situ, which contacted synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane. Functional measurements revealed that the accumulation of TDP-43 filaments led to presynaptic dysfunction and subsequent neuronal hyperexcitability. These findings suggest that synapses are a major early site of TDP-43 filament accumulation, relevant to their propagation, and directly link TDP-43 filament gain of function to synaptic dysfunction.",

    "content": "The cerebellum undergoes substantial maturation with regionally distinct developmental trajectories. This study examined cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) in healthy children, adolescents, and adults, using voxel-based morphometry, the ACAPULCO algorithm, and the SUIT toolbox for cerebellum-optimized analyses. A total of 104 typically developing children (n=31, 6-9 years), adolescents (n=35, 13-17 years), and adults (n=38, 30-40 years) were included. We hypothesized age group differences in cerebellar GMV, with adolescents showing the greatest volume, specifically in posterolateral regions. Results revealed significant group differences in GMV. We observed region-specific volumetric patterns, with some areas (e.g., Crus II, lobule X) increasing from childhood to adolescence followed by stabilization, whereas other areas (e.g., lobules I-IV and VI, Crus I, vermis VI and VIIb) exhibited peak GMV during adolescence, with lower volumes in both children and adults. These patterns were partly consistent with our hypothesis. Notably, no regions had greater GMV in adults than adolescents, suggesting that cerebellar growth peaks in adolescence before stabilizing. Our findings indicate differential developmental patterns both between and within lobules of the cerebellum, and highlight adolescence as a peak period of cerebellar growth, with potential implications for the development of cerebellar-supported cognitive and emotional functions that undergo significant changes during this period.",

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Moral decision making and moral judgment in multiple sclerosis.",
    "content": "Objective: Moral cognition has been insufficiently studied in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). This study investigated moral decision making and judgment using ecologically valid moral dilemmas in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive MS phenotypes, exploring associations with clinical and psychological variables. Method: Twenty-one individuals with relapsing-remitting MS and 21 with progressive MS completed a battery of moral dilemmas (instrumental, incidental, and ecological) and questionnaires assessing quality of life, mood, alexithymia, and empathy. Data from pwMS were compared to those of 56 age- and education-matched healthy controls. Group differences were analyzed using Mann\u2013Whitney U tests, and effect sizes (<em>r</em>) were reported. Results: Compared to healthy controls, pwMS showed significantly higher moral acceptability in instrumental (<em>U</em> = 633.0, <em>p</em> = .001, <em>r</em> = 0.39), incidental (<em>U</em> = 745.5, <em>p</em> = .035, <em>r</em> = 0.23), and ecological dilemmas (<em>U</em> = 563.0, <em>p</em>< .001, \n<em>r</em> = 0.44). Moral permissiveness was positively correlated with disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale: \u03c1 = 0.36, <em>p</em> = .019) and negatively with physical quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life\u2013Physical: \u03c1 = \u22120.33, <em>p</em> = .034) and inhibitory control (Stroop Test: \u03c1 = 0.47, <em>p</em> = .002). Empathy scores were inversely correlated with moral acceptability across all dilemmas (<em>p</em> < .05). Conclusions: PwMS exhibit increased moral permissiveness, particularly in relation to clinical disability, physical functioning, and executive control. These findings contribute to characterizing the sociocognitive profile of MS and support the inclusion of moral cognition in future research, though implications for patient care remain preliminary.

    "title": "Moderating effects of limbic white matter on verbal memory in older adults with multiple sclerosis.",
    "content": "Objective: Literature concerning the structural brain correlates of verbal memory in aging with multiple sclerosis (MS) is scarce. This study addressed this gap by examining the impact of white matter microstructure and macrostructure on verbal memory in older adults with and without MS. Method: Participants were 64 older adults with MS (OAMS; age <em>M</em> [<em>SD</em>] = 64.19 [3.82]) and 72 controls (age <em>M</em> [<em>SD</em>] = 69.78 [6.99]). Verbal memory was measured using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test\u2013Revised (HVLT-R), and white matter fractional anisotropy and lesion volume were extracted from diffusion tensor and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery magnetic resonance imaging. Statistical models examined whether white matter measures moderated the association between the presence of MS and HVLT-R performance. Results: Adjusted moderation models revealed that OAMS showed lower HVLT-R total immediate recall compared to controls in the presence of higher lesion volume in the bilateral fornices, left uncinate fasciculus, and right ventral cingulum, and lower HVLT-R delayed recall in the presence of lower fractional anisotropy in the right ventral cingulum and higher lesion volume in the left uncinate fasciculus and right ventral cingulum, with small effect sizes (interaction term \u0394<em>R</em>\u00b2s = .03\u2013.06,<em> p</em>s < .05). Conclusions: Recall was lower in OAMS when limbic tract white matter had lower integrity and higher lesion load. Findings suggest that the influence of MS on verbal memory in older adults is related, in part, to underlying white matter disruptions in tracts implicated in memory. While the sample was generally representative of the U.S. MS population (majority White women), generalizability is limited and warrants further research.

    "content": "Objective: Previous research suggested that Recognition Memory Test\u2013Words (RMT-W) scores may be confounded by gender and handedness. This study was designed to examine its classification accuracy as a performance validity test (PVT) and susceptibility to demographic characteristics. Method: Archival data were collected from a consecutive sequence of 310 diagnostically heterogeneous examinees (181 men; <em>M</em><sub>Age</sub> = 41.4; <em>M</em><sub>Education</sub> = 12.9). The RMT-W\u2019s classification accuracy was computed against psychometrically operationalized criterion groups. Results: Optimal RMT-W cutoffs (\u2264 42 to \u2264 40) produced a good combination of sensitivity (.62\u2013.70) and specificity (.90\u2013.96), correctly classifying 85.6%\u201387.7% of the sample. Women scored 1.5 points higher. RMT-W scores were unrelated to handedness but were correlated with education. A linear relationship emerged between level of education and the cutoff needed to achieve \u2265 .90 specificity: \u2264 43 for \u2265 13 years of education, \u2264 41 for 12 years of education, and \u2264 39 for \u2264 11 years of education. RMT-W \u2264 45 had .91 specificity in women with postsecondary education. Conclusions: Results suggest that overall, the RMT-W remains an effective free-standing PVT. Gender, age, and handedness in isolation had minimal impact on RMT-W scores. However, education had a clinically significant effect. The combined effect of gender and education produced a marked shift in classification accuracy. Systematic research is needed on the relationship between demographics and PVT outcomes to ensure that cutoffs have the same clinical interpretation regardless of patient variables.

    "title": "Exploring the link between National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery performance and everyday functioning in mild cognitive impairment.",
    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychologists routinely use scores on traditional paper-and-pencil tests to assess capacity for independent functioning, with these assessments accounting for a moderate amount (20%\u201337%) of the variance in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) performance. The field is shifting toward incorporation of computerized neuropsychological assessments such as the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB). There have been no studies examining how the NIHTB-CB relates to IADL performance or whether it better predicts IADL performance compared to traditional methods. Method: Data from 74 participants in the Lithium as a Treatment to Prevent Impairment of Cognition in Elders were analyzed. Participants completed a neuropsychological assessment battery, the NIHTB-CB, and measures of IADL capacity. Linear regression was used to determine whether NIHTB-CB performance predicted IADL performance. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to determine whether NIHTB-CB added incremental validity to the prediction of IADL performance. Results: Select NIHTB-CB measures predicted IADL functioning as measured by a performance-based assessment of everyday functioning, but not self- or informant-reported everyday functioning. Of these subtests, two were found to add incremental validity to the prediction of IADL performance above and beyond their matched traditional measures, with effect sizes ranging from mild to moderate (<em>F</em>\u0394<em>R</em>\u00b2 = .045\u2013.077). Conclusions: We found performance on individual NIHTB-CB subtests predicted approximately the same amount of variance in IADL functioning as traditional tests, with only subtests assessing processing speed and executive functioning adding a mild to moderate amount of additional variance above matched measures. It remains important for clinicians to consider additional determinants of functioning when using computerized assessments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Familial longevity, educational attainment, and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities are independently protective for cognitive aging, yet little is known about how these factors relate with one another. We explored the interplay between familial longevity, life exposures that confer cognitive resilience, and cognitive function in the Long Life Family Study. Method: A series of Bayesian hierarchical regression models was used to examine the associations among familial longevity, educational attainment, participation in cognitively stimulating activities, and neuropsychological test performance in several cognitive domains in an ancillary observational study of Long Life Family Study family members and a referent cohort (<em>N</em> = 314, <em>M</em> = 75.7, <em>SD</em> = 14.6 years). Models were adjusted by age, sex, and upstream variables along the regression pathway (i.e., cognitive activity, education, and familial longevity), and incorporated a random intercept for family relatedness. Results: Referents had greater engagement in cognitive activities, and in turn, those with higher levels of education and cognitive activity exhibited better neuropsychological performance. Greater cognitive activity was specifically associated with better executive functioning, episodic memory, and language scores. Although Long Life Family Study family members engaged in cognitive activities less often than referents, they performed better on tests of episodic memory, and matched performance on tests of executive function, language, and visuoconstruction. Conclusions: These results suggest that familial longevity and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities represent two distinct pathways that contribute to preserved cognition in older adulthood, though these findings should be replicated in more diverse samples. Furthermore, these unique pathways differ across tests and cognitive domains. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Remote assessment of episodic memory would be a cost-effective alternative to in-person visits for early detection of memory impairment related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), but there is a need for test development and studies in population-based samples. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity and correlates of a novel three-trial administration of 10-word list learning included in the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status in a population-based study of 65- to 96-year-old individuals. Method: A total of 800 participants completed telephone-administered word list learning task that yielded immediate and delayed recall measures. We compared these to corresponding measures from in-person neuropsychological assessment and tested differences between cognitively normal individuals and those with cognitive impairment or neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, we studied the associations of age, sex, education, and genetic risk of AD with telephone-administered memory measures. Results: Telephone-administered three-trial word list learning task yielded normally distributed immediate and delayed recall measures that performed like corresponding measures from in-person assessment. Having cognitive impairment or AD\u2014but not genetic risk of AD\u2014were related to poorer memory performance. Younger age, being female, and having secondary education were related to better memory performance. Conclusion: Our study supports the validity of telephone-administered word list task with multiple learning trials. Remote assessment of memory can be used as an alternative to inviting people to in-person assessment and is also easily accessible for people living in remote areas and for those with physical disabilities or during restrictions related to in-person contact.

Method: Participants (<em>N</em> = 891) from the University of California Davis Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center longitudinal cohort (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 76.1, <em>SD</em><sub>age</sub> = 7.4) were followed for an average of 4.4 years with annual ECog assessments. Multilevel beta regression was used to model ECog scores as a function of time, cognitive domain, diagnosis change, and\u2014in a neuroimaging subsample (<em>N</em> = 264)\u2014cross-sectional and longitudinal total gray matter and hippocampus volume. Results: ECog domains changed at different rates when modeled as a function of diagnosis change; differences in domain were most apparent in the stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-MCI and MCI-to-dementia conversion groups. By contrast, ECog domains changed at the same rate when modeled as a function of baseline gray matter volume and longitudinal gray matter volume change, corresponding to other research suggesting that cognitive domains change at relatively uniform rates over time. In separate models, total gray matter and hippocampus atrophy were salient predictors of ECog score changes. At baseline, hippocampus volume was the strongest predictor of ECog intercepts. Conclusions: Although some caution is warranted interpreting score changes due to floor and ceiling effects, the ECog appears sensitive to underlying gray matter atrophy and change in clinical disease severity when used longitudinally.

They recognize the many serious challenges that today\u2019s scientists are facing in public perception, funding, and policy. Building upon the journal\u2019s strong, 39-year foundation of scientific excellence and outstanding leadership, they aspire to leverage the journal\u2019s rigorous editorial processes, tremendous resources, and international reach for the betterment of society, scientists, and the communities of people with conditions that affect the central nervous system. In this editorial, they provide a brief history of Neuropsychology to help us plot a course for the next 5 years. From their vantage point, Neuropsychology\u2019s future is data-driven, transparent, inclusive, and community-oriented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",

Whats our purpose? <em>Whats the point?</em></p>\n<p>For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth.</p>\n<p>As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress.</p>\n<p>I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings. However I believe its important that we each learn to <em><strong>harness that energy into things that are positive and kind</strong></em>, not negative or evil.</p>\n<p>Remember that a lot of who you are, is your ability to experience things outside of yourself, <em>including other humans.</em> They are a direct and immediate part of your own reality. Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved. As frustrating as the world can be, it is worth protecting, it is worth loving, it is worth healing together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish...

    "content": "Blood pressure (BP) measuring devices are essential tools across all areas of medicine, where BP is used as a vital sign for assessing cardiovascular status, guiding clinical decisions in acute medicine, critical care, and routine monitoring of hospitalized patients. International standards for BP measuring devices establish safety and accuracy criteria to ensure the reliability and usability of these instruments. The standardization of BP device validation protocols is vital to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of readings, which are crucial for effective medical decision-making. However, with the rapid advancements in the field of novel cuffless continuous or intermittent blood pressure monitoring devices, traditional validation standards for cuff-based devices are not applicable to cuffless systems. To address this, various organizations have established specific standards tailored for cuffless continuous blood pressure monitoring devices. Nevertheless, only 67 out of over 3,800 studies on the cuffless continuous BP devices (<2%) adopted the appropriate validation criteria, thereby compromising the accuracy and reliability of their reported results. This work presents a comparative analysis of validation protocols for BP measuring devices and provides guidance on the appropriate standards for different types of BP monitors, aims to highlight areas where standards might be strengthened or harmonized. The findings of this research are intended to contribute to the ongoing efforts to establish globally recognized, scientifically rigorous guidelines for the validation of BP measuring devices, fostering innovation and technological advances in this field over time.",

    "content": "Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that severely impacts mobility and quality of life, particularly among older adults. Its diagnosis often relies on subjective assessments using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, leading to variability in clinical evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a confidence-driven deep learning framework for early KOA detection, focusing on distinguishing KL-0 and KL-2 stages. The Siamese-based framework integrates a novel multi-level feature extraction architecture with a hybrid loss strategy. Specifically, multi-level Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers are employed to extract features from varying network depths, ensuring comprehensive feature representation, while the hybrid loss strategy partitions training samples into high-, medium-, and low-confidence subsets. Tailored loss functions are applied to improve model robustness and effectively handle uncertainty in annotations. Experimental results on the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, comparable to those of expert radiologists. Cohen's kappa values ($\\kappa$ $>$ 0.85)) confirm substantial agreement, while McNemar's test ($p$ $>$ 0.05) indicates no statistically significant differences between the model and radiologists. Additionally, Confidence distribution analysis reveals that the model emulates radiologists' decision-making patterns. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach to serve as an auxiliary diagnostic tool, enhancing early KOA detection and reducing clinical workload.",

    "content": "Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) have emerged as a groundbreaking neural technology for restoring motor function and enabling direct neural communication pathways. Despite their therapeutic potential in neurological rehabilitation, the critical challenge of neural decoder calibration persists, particularly in the context of transfer learning. Traditional calibration approaches assume the availability of extensive neural recordings, which is often impractical in clinical settings due to patient fatigue and neural signal variability. Furthermore, the inherent constraints of implanted neural processors\u2014including limited computational capacity and power consumption requirements\u2014demand streamlined processing algorithms. To address these clinical and technical challenges, we developed DMM-WcycleGAN (Dimensionality Reduction Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning based Wasserstein Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks), a novel neural decoding framework that integrates meta-learning principles with optimal transfer learning strategies. This innovative approach enables efficient decoder calibration using minimal neural data while implementing dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize computational efficiency in implanted devices. In vivo experiments with non-human primates demonstrated DMM-WcycleGAN's superior performance in mitigating neural signal distribution shifts between historical and current recordings, achieving a 3% enhancement in neural decoding accuracy using only ten calibration trials while reducing the calibration duration by over 70%, thus significantly improving the clinical viability of iBMI systems.",

    "content": "Common activities of daily living naturally blend walking on level ground, stairs, and slopes. Predicting human locomotion behavior across these environments is critical for control design in lower-limb assistive devices. One approach to achieving this goal is to use feedforward simulation of conceptual gait models that capture the whole body dynamics of human locomotion. So far, however, these models have mainly been developed to predict human walking and running dynamics on level ground. Objective: To develop a conceptual gait model that can walk on level ground as well as negotiate stairs and ramps of different inclinations (up to $\\pm 42^\\circ$) while producing biomimetic ground reaction forces (GRFs). Methods: We extended the passive bipedal spring mass model by incorporating active elements, introducing seven control parameters. These parameters were then tuned to match the human GRFs for stairs. Results: By optimizing these control parameters, we found that the resultant model's GRF correlates strongly with human data with median Pearson correlation coefficients $R_{x}>0.89$ and $R_{y}>0.96$ for stair walking. Furthermore, we observe its predictive capabilities are not limited to stairs, as it can also mimic the GRFs of human slope walking. Finally, we conducted a parameter analysis to assess how model parameters affect GRFs and identified a reduced, five parameter model that can reproduce human GRFs with a fidelity similar to the seven parameter model. Significance: The model may help to predict human locomotion behavior in more complex terrain, for instance, when planning foot placements in the interactive control of powered lower-limb exoskeletons and prostheses.",

    "content": "Objective: Harmonic Motion Imaging (HMI) is an ultrasound elasticity imaging method that measures the mechanical properties of tissue using amplitude-modulated acoustic radiation force (AM-ARF). Multi-frequency HMI (MF-HMI) excites tissue at various AM frequencies simultaneously, allowing for image optimization without prior knowledge of inclusion size and stiffness. However, challenges remain in size estimation as inconsistent boundary effects result in different perceived sizes across AM frequencies. Herein, we developed an automated assessment method for tumor and focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) induced lesions using a transformer-based multi-modality neural network, HMINet, and further automated neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) response prediction. HMINet was trained on 380 pairs of MF-HMI and B-mode images of phantoms and in vivo orthotopic breast cancer mice (4T1). Test datasets included phantoms (n = 32), in vivo 4T1 mice (n = 24), breast cancer patients (n = 20), FUS-induced lesions in ex vivo animal tissue and in vivo clinical settings with real-time inference, with average segmentation accuracy (Dice) of 0.91, 0.83, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. HMINet outperformed state-of-the-art models; we also demonstrated the enhanced robustness of the multi-modality strategy over B-mode-only, both quantitatively through Dice scores and in terms of interpretation using saliency analysis. The contribution of AM frequency based on the number of salient pixels showed that the most significant AM frequencies are 800 and 200 Hz across clinical cases. Significance: We developed an automated, multimodality ultrasound-based tumor and FUS lesion assessment method, which facilitates the clinical translation of stiffness-based breast cancer treatment response prediction and real-time image-guided FUS therapy.",

    "title": "Electrophysiological Correlates of Reinforcement Learning in the Human Ventral Tegmental Area",
    "content": "The ventral tegmental area is the primary source of dopaminergic input to the human prefrontal cortex and plays a central role in reinforcement learning. Although animal studies have established that dopaminergic neurons encode reward prediction error signals, direct electrophysiological evidence in humans is scarce. Understanding these mechanisms is clinically relevant because of their involvement in disorders of motivation and reward processing. In this cross-sectional study, we recorded local field potentials from the ventral tegmental area in fourteen patients (nine male; mean age 46 years, range 30-62) undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery for chronic cluster headache. During temporary electrode externalisation, participants performed a probabilistic instrumental learning task comprising reward, loss and neutral trials. Behaviour was modelled using a hierarchical Rescorla-Wagner framework with separate learning rates for rewards and losses. Electrophysiological responses were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping and linear mixed-effects models testing sensitivity to outcome, expected value and reward prediction error. Clear evoked responses were observed for stimulus and outcome events in thirteen subjects. Responses reflecting the contrast between outcomes that delivered a gain, a loss or a neutral signal and those delivering no outcome were significantly larger for gains than for losses or neutral signals (paired t-tests: gain versus loss, t(12)=2.60, p=0.023, Cohen's d=0.72; gain versus neutral, t(12)=4.49, p<0.001, d=1.25), while loss and neutral contrasts did not differ (p=0.218). Nine of fourteen subjects developed a clear preference for the high-reward option; two exhibited gradual learning, while others adopted a win-stay strategy. In eight subjects with clear evoked responses, activity around the button press correlated with the expected value of the chosen option (peak at 0.02s, p=0.013, corrected). In a further subset of two subjects who explored the low-value option, single-trial responses peaked closer to the button press during low-value choices. No compelling evidence was found for a distinct reward prediction error signal beyond outcome and value. Clinical covariates and smoking status did not significantly modulate electrophysiological responses. Human ventral tegmental area activity is selectively tuned to rewarding outcomes and, under conditions of effective learning, reflects the expected value of chosen options during decision-making. These findings align with reinforcement learning principles established in animal models and suggest that local field potentials primarily represent inputs to reward prediction error computation rather than its output. This work provides the first direct electrophysiological evidence of reward-related signalling in the human ventral tegmental area, supporting its translational relevance for understanding motivation and guiding neuromodulatory interventions.",

    "title": "Graph-Based EEG Symmetry Features from the Temporal Lobe as Markers of Antidepressant Treatment Response",
    "content": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder that affects millions globally and has highly individualized responses to antidepressant treatment. Identifying objective early markers that can distinguish responders from non-responders remains a critical challenge in personalized psychiatry. In this study, we investigate the role of brain symmetry in EEG-derived functional connectivity as a potential early marker of treatment response. Using resting-state EEG recordings from 176 patients diagnosed with MDD at baseline (Visit~1) and after one week of treatment (Visit~2), we construct graph-based representations of functional connectivity and define region-wise and electrode-wise temporal-lobe symmetry features. We focus on symmetry emph{change scores} (Visit~2$-$Visit~1) across typical EEG frequency bands in both weighted and binary forms. Statistical analyses reveal a consistent group-level pattern in the $alpha$ and $beta$ bands: responders show negative symmetry change scores, whereas non-responders show relative stability or weakly positive change scores. The contrast is strongest in the $beta_1$ band and is more pronounced for binary symmetry metrics, while the $alpha$ band shows the same direction with slightly weaker significance. Physiologically, these opposite trajectories are emph{consistent with} a treatment-related shift toward more lateralized temporal-lobe network organization in responders and a more bilateral coupling pattern in non-responders; however, these neurophysiological interpretations remain hypothesis-generating given the resting-state design and the absence of direct behavioral or task-based validation. To quantify whether temporal symmetry change scores contain reproducible discriminative signal under strict validation, we benchmark the proposed features in a supervised classification pipeline using repeated nested cross-validation. The best-performing configuration achieved a median out-of-sample AUC of 0.690 with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval of [0.611, 0.711], indicating modest but reproducible separability. Overall, temporal-lobe symmetry change features provide interpretable candidate markers of early antidepressant-related neurophysiological change that may complement existing EEG predictors in future multi-marker models, but they are not yet sufficient for standalone clinical decision support and require external validation in independent cohorts.",

    "title": "Population decoding of sound source location by receptive field neurons in the mouse superior colliculus",
    "content": "Identifying the location of a sound source in a complex environment and assessing its importance can be crucial for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure involved in sensorimotor functions, contributes to sound localization and contains auditory responsive neurons that have spatially restricted receptive fields (RFs) that are organized into a topographic map along the azimuth. However, individual auditory SC neurons have large spatial RFs, are noisy, and do not respond to the same stimulus at each trial. Therefore, when an animal is presented with a single trial sound, and it needs to rely on a single neuron to locate the sound source direction, the location measurement may be erroneous, missing, or have poor spatial resolution. It is expected that a more reliable and accurate determination of the sound source location will come from a population of neurons. We therefore built a population pattern Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) decoder to build a model that can accurately predict the location of a stimulus given the population response. We compared three models that use either strict firing rate (FR), weighting based on equal (EW) or mutual information (MIW) and show that the MIW model works best, needing only 92 neurons to localize a stimulus with behaviorally relevant precision. Furthermore, by comparing the model fit using the responses from non-RF and RF auditory neurons, we show that only RF neurons contain the information needed to localize a sound source. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the SC uses a population of RF neurons to determine sound source location.",

    "title": "An integrated platform for simultaneous wide-field voltage/calcium imaging and fMRI (EPI & ZTE) reveals neuronal infraslow dynamics underlying functional connectivity",
    "content": "Wide-field optical imaging acquired simultaneously with functional MRI has the ability to provide unprecedented insight into the neural origins of time-varying whole-brain activity. Simultaneously linking cellular-scale activity to whole-brain fMRI remains challenging due to optical access, RF coil placement, and transmission constraints in the MRI environment. We present an integrated platform that combines a long-distance tube lens optical path (>98% transmission), a chronically stable optically-fused cranial window, and a subject-conformal RF surface coil compatible with both EPI and zero-echo-time (ZTE) fMRI. The system supports concurrent wide-field imaging of genetically encoded voltage or calcium indicators concurrently with intrinsic hemoglobin signals. In individual mice, wide-field optical and fMRI measures yield concordant functional connectivity, and cross-modal timing analyses demonstrate that neuronal infraslow dynamics (<0.1 Hz) underlie the majority of fMRI connectivity, after removing hemodynamic crosstalk. The platform's sensitivity, chronic stability, and sequence flexibility broaden access to cellular-to-whole-brain investigations across basic and translational neuroimaging.",

    "title": "Preventing Data Leakage in Neural Decoding",
    "content": "Neural decoding is a widely-used machine learning technique for investigating how behavior, perception and cognition are represented in neural activity. However without careful application data leakage can occur, where information from the test set contaminates the training set, leading to biased estimates of decoding performance and potentially invalidating biological conclusions. Here we use simulated and biological datasets to demonstrate how both supervised and unsupervised data preprocessing, including dimensionality reduction, can introduce leakage in neural decoding studies. We reveal that in some cases leakage can paradoxically decrease decoding performance relative to unbiased estimates, and we provide theoretical analyses explaining how this occurs. We demonstrate that, for autocorrelated neural time series, standard k-fold cross-validation can dramatically overstate performance. Finally we provide detailed recommendations for avoiding data leakage in neural decoding.",

    "title": "Rendering Affective Touch With an Array of Pneumatic Unit Cell Actuators",
    "content": "Rendering affective touch through haptic interfaces has gathered significant interest due to its ability to elicit emotional responses. Among various forms of affective touch, this study focuses on stroke stimuli. An illusory stroke stimulus is rendered using eight discrete Pneumatic Unit Cell (PUC) actuators on the left forearm. The study systematically investigates how rendering parameters\u2014including the traveling speed of the illusory stroke, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive indentations, and indentation pressure\u2014affect the perceived pleasantness and continuity of the stimulus. Results reveal that higher speeds significantly improved both pleasantness and continuity, with speed emerging as the most influential factor. In contrast, SOA has no significant effect on either perceived pleasantness or continuity. Indentation pressure shows a moderate impact on pleasantness, with high pressures reducing pleasantness but having no significant effect on continuity. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between perceived pleasantness and continuity, underscoring the relevance of the continuity illusion created by sequential indentations with discrete actuators in evoking pleasant sensations. These findings demonstrate the potential of PUC actuators for creating affective touch stimuli and provide preliminary insights into the influence of rendering parameters on affective touch in human-machine and human-robot interactions.",

    "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

    "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

    "title": "The mood stabilizer lithium alters behaviour and physiology via the gut brain axis.",
    "content": "Lithium, introduced 75 years ago by John Cade1, remains the most effective mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder2. Lithium is proposed to modulate an array of cellular pathways, many ubiquitous to all cells, with pleiotropic roles unlinked to bipolar disorder or lithium responsiveness in genome wide association studies3,4. These mechanisms cannot explain lithium's specific effects on mood and behaviour. We demonstrate that lithium's primary action is in the periphery, not in the brain itself. Lithium acts in the gut to trigger behavioural and physiological changes, akin to those associated with a torpor-like state, that protect individuals from ingested toxins. Lithium activates gastrointestinal enterochromaffin (EC) cells via their Trpm2 cation channels to modulate afferent vagal and area postrema inputs to the brain. Eliminating these inputs by focal brain lesions eliminates lithium's effects, as does ablation of EC cells or their Trpm2 expression. Lithium's Trpm2-dependent activation of EC cells also occurs in human gut tissue, providing translational relevance for our discovery. These findings challenge the prevailing perception that lithium acts directly on the brain. Via a previously unsuspected gut-brain pathway, lithium engages brain circuitry that reduces arousal and interaction with the external world, therapeutic goals in the manic phase of bipolar disorder.",

    "title": "Dynamic conformational ensembles of soluble Tau encode neuronal toxicity prior to aggregation",
    "content": "Tau aggregation is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies, yet the conformational states of Tau in neurons prior to aggregation remain poorly understood. Existing structural models are derived largely from fibrillar assemblies and provide limited insight into the dynamic, soluble Tau species that initiate pathology. Here, we combine hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry with super-resolution imaging and neuronal models to define the conformational ensemble of soluble Tau under physiological and disease-relevant conditions. We show that soluble Tau populates distinct, dynamic conformations characterized by regional stabilization and long-range intramolecular interactions that are invisible to fibril-based structures. Disease-associated perturbations selectively remodel these conformational ensembles, exposing aggregation-prone regions and altering Tau subcellular organization in neurons. Notably, these Tau species inhibit axonal transport, which is essential for neuronal health, linking specific ensemble states to neuronal toxicity. These findings establish soluble Tau conformation as a dynamic, regulatable state that precedes aggregation and encodes disease relevance. By defining the structural logic of Tau before fibril formation, this work provides a framework for understanding early tauopathy mechanisms and for targeting Tau pathology at its earliest stages.",

    "title": "Traumatic Brain Injury Associated with Altered Corpus Callosum Microstructure in Females: Exploring the Roles of Menopause Timing and Hormone Therapy in UK Biobank",
    "content": "Abstract Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has lasting effects on white matter, yet sex-specific factors such as menopause timing and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may modulate these outcomes in females. Objectives To investigate how TBI, menopause timing, HRT use, and reproductive history relate to corpus callosum white matter microstructure in female UK Biobank participants. Design Cross-sectional analysis of UK Biobank diffusion MRI data using propensity score matching to compare females with TBI to controls. Methods We analyzed diffusion MRI data from females with and without TBI. Corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF) were assessed. TBI effects were examined across pre- and post-menopausal groups, accounting for HRT use, duration, and reproductive factors. Results Females with TBI (n=363) exhibited widespread corpus callosum alterations compared to propensity-matched controls (n=10,128), with reduced FA across all regions (genu: B=-0.006, FDR p=0.027; body: B =-0.006, FDR p=0.002; splenium: B;=-0.004, FDR p=0.009) and elevated MD in anterior regions (genu: FDR p=0.001; body: FDR p=0.002). TBI sustained before menopause was associated with significantly lower splenium FA (B=-0.010, p=0.031) and higher body MD (B=0.000019, p=0.021) compared with TBI sustained after menopause and controls. HRT use did not modify TBI-related alterations in primary analyses. However, among HRT users (n=3,108), a significant TBIxduration interaction emerged for genu MD (B=2.00 x 10-6; p=0.0295), indicating that the effect of HRT duration on white matter microstructure differed between TBI cases and healthy females. Reproductive factors (parity, reproductive lifespan) independently predicted some white matter measures but did not confound TBI, menopause timing, or HRT associations. Conclusions TBI-related white matter changes in females are influenced by menopause timing and hormonal exposure, with HRT effects dependent on duration and injury context. These findings highlight the importance of sex- and hormone-specific approaches in TBI research and the need for longitudinal studies to clarify mechanisms and potential interventions.",

In this paper, we detail the design and evaluation of three wearable prototypes (Vibration, Skin Drag, and Tapping) capable of administering discrete (individual, separate pulses and stimuli). and continuous (overlapping or uninterrupted stimuli) forms of linear haptic cycles with inspiration from slow, deep guided breathing. Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

    "title": "Haptics of Pulse Palpation: Simulation and Validation Through Novel Sensor-Actuator System",
    "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

    "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
    "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

    "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
    "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

    "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

    "title": "Is torpor a quiescent state? Periodic motility and transient brain activation during daily torpor in Djungarian hamsters",
    "content": "Torpor is a hypometabolic state employed by many mammalian and non-mammalian species to cope with harsh environments. When exposed to a short photoperiod, Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) enter daily torpor with body temperatures dropping as low as 15 degrees Celcius. Despite the widely-held notion that torpor is a form of deep sleep, torpid animals are not completely inactive but exhibit occasional movements reflected in an increase in EMG tone. Little is known about these EMG events during torpor and whether they have a functional role during the torpid state. We here analysed EEG, EMG, and brain temperature data from Djungarian hamsters, and used an automatic detection algorithm to identify periods of EMG activation during spontaneous daily torpor. The hamsters exhibited regular periods of motility that were invariably initiated during a decline in brain temperature and were followed by a brain temperature increase. The frequency of EMG events exhibited a negative correlation with brain temperature, such that lower brain temperature was associated with a higher frequency of EMG events. In addition, EMG events were associated with a pronounced increase in EEG power, especially between 9.5-15.5 Hz, which often started with an EEG pattern similar to an evoked potential preceding the increase in the EMG activity. On the contrary, micro-arousals during normothermic NREM sleep were associated with a decrease in EEG power, a decrease in brain temperature and were of shorter duration than torpor EMG events, indicating that the two phenomena may serve different purposes. We speculate that periodic motility associated with increased brain activity during torpor may play a role in thermoregulation, and help retain vigilance to potentially mitigate predation risk during this hypometabolic state.",

    "content": "People differ remarkably from one another, yet isolating individual differences in their brain activity remains challenging. Non-invasive whole-brain recordings of human brain activity, such as those from resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), are complex and noisy, making it difficult to isolate stable dimensions of individual differences. Ideally, we want to find a few core dimensions that vary across people but have high test-retest reliability, giving the same value each time they are measured in the same person. However, it is still unknown whether any such reliable dimensions exist, and if they do, what could drive this reliability. Here, we show that there is a low-dimensional linear subspace of highly-reliable rs-fMRI activity. These dimensions form personal fingerprints, allowing participants to be identified with high accuracy despite fingerprints explaining only a fraction of the total variance. Many of these dimensions inherit their reliability from a single morphological, demographic, or behavioral property, and most dimensions can be predicted from the anatomical layout of cortical regions. These dimensions were identified using reliability component analysis (RCA), a new dimensionality reduction technique similar to principal component analysis (PCA) but which maximizes reliability instead of explained variance. Together, our findings suggest that stable individual signatures can be isolated from rs-fMRI. These signatures reflect persistent anatomical and physiological differences, and provide a principled low-dimensional basis for biomarker discovery.",

    "title": "Sample size dependence of Occam's razor in human decision-making",
    "content": "To make sense of a noisy world, living beings constantly face decisions between competing interpretations for ambiguous sensory data. This process parallels statistical model selection, where most frameworks, like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), are based on a trade-off between a model's goodness-of-fit and its complexity. The same tradeoff has been observed in humans. However, a core tenet of normative frameworks is that the trade-off should depend on the sample size (N); as more data becomes available, the goodness-of-fit grows faster than the complexity penalty, weakening the overall bias towards simplicity. It is unknown whether humans also conform to this scaling principle, and if so, whether it arises from an optimal computation or a simpler heuristic. Here, we investigate this question using a preregistered visual task where subjects inferred the number of latent Gaussian sources generating clusters of data-points, and where the number of points (N) presented on each trial is varied systematically. We use three kinds of model to describe their behavior: a model with linear scaling of evidence in N (as in BIC and AIC), a model with no scaling, and a model with sub-linear scaling inspired by known biases in numerosity perception. Our results demonstrate that the normative, linear scaling model provides the worst account of human behavior. Instead, we find strong evidence for a sub-linear scaling of sample size. By inferring the shape of this scaling with Gaussian Processes, we reveal a distinct logarithmic trend for smaller N, and a flattening for higher values, both consistent with numerosity perception biases. This finding suggests that, when selecting for competing explanations for sensory data, humans do not perform a principled computation but rather employ a more efficient heuristic that repurposes lower perceptual mechanisms to dynamically weight evidence against model complexity.",

    "title": "Show HN: LemonSlice \u2013 Give your voice agents a face",
    "content": "<p>Hey HN, we're the co-founders of LemonSlice (<a href=\"https://lemonslice.com\">https://lemonslice.com</a>). We train interactive avatar video models. Our API lets you upload a photo and immediately jump into a FaceTime-style call with that character. Here's a demo: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9</a><p>Chatbots are everywhere. Voice AI has recently taken off. But we believe video avatars will be the most common form factor for conversational AI. Most people would rather watch something than read it. The problem is that generating video in real-time is hard, and overcoming the uncanny valley is even harder.<p>We haven\u2019t broken the uncanny valley yet. Nobody has. But we\u2019re getting close and our photorealistic avatars are currently best-in-class (judge for yourself: <a href=\"https://lemonslice.com/try/taylor\">https://lemonslice.com/try/taylor</a>). Plus, we're the only avatar model that can do animals and heavily stylized cartoons. Try it: <a href=\"https://lemonslice.com/try/alien\">https://lemonslice.com/try/alien</a>. Warning! Talking to this little guy may improve your mood.<p>Today we're releasing our new model* - Lemon Slice 2, a 20B-parameter diffusion transformer that generates infinite-length video at 20fps on a single GPU - and opening up our API.<p>How did we get a video diffusion model to run in real-time? There was no single trick, just a lot of them stacked together. The first big change was making our model causal. Standard video diffusion models are bidirectional (they look at frames both before and after the current one), which means you can't stream.<p>From there it was about fitting everything on one GPU. We switched from full to sliding window attention, which killed our memory bottleneck. We distilled from 40 denoising steps down to just a few - quality degraded less than we feared, especially after using GAN-based distillation (though tuning that adversarial loss to avoid mode collapse was its own adventure).<p>And the rest was inference work: modifying RoPE from complex to real (this one was cool!), precision tuning, fusing kernels, a special rolling KV cache, lots of other caching, and more. We kept shaving off milliseconds wherever we could and eventually got to real-time.<p>We set up a guest playground for HN so you can create and talk to characters without logging in: <a href=\"https://lemonslice.com/hn\">https://lemonslice.com/hn</a>. For those who want to build with our API (we have a new LiveKit integration that we\u2019re pumped about!), grab a coupon code in the HN playground for your first Pro month free ($100 value). See the docs: <a href=\"https://lemonslice.com/docs\">https://lemonslice.com/docs</a>. Pricing is usage-based at $0.12-0.20/min for video generation.<p>Looking forward to your feedback! And we\u2019d love to see any cool characters you make - please share their links in the comments<p>*We did a Show HN last year for our V1 model: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785044\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785044</a>.

    "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

    "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

    "content": "While vibrotactile displays continue to gain popularity, it remains that the phenomenon of tactile change blindness negatively impacts the human ability to detect changes between and within tactile signals. This paper surveys the research literature on tactile change detection and blindness under various parameters, including the number of tactors used, the intensity and length of the stimulus, and whether distractors between stimuli (i.e., transients) were used during experimentation, among others. The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",

    "title": "From Restoration to Augmentation: New Approaches to Haptic Feedback for Artificial Limbs",
    "content": "Haptic feedback is essential for precise motor control, making its integration into artificial limbs a critical design challenge. Current approaches to restoring lost tactile input in patients have focused on interfacing with somatosensory pathways at the brain, nerve, or skin level, achieving partial restoration. However, augmentative artificial limbs, devices that provide novel movement capabilities beyond the biological body, pose unique challenges. These limbs lack dedicated sensory pathways, raising fundamental questions about how to deliver tactile feedback for these devices without disrupting existing somatosensory function. A promising direction lies in exploiting intrinsic tactile feedback, which emerges naturally at the interface between wearable devices and the body. When an artificial limb moves or interacts with objects, the skin detects rich tactile cues transmitted through this interface. Amplifying and refining this intrinsic feedback, via materials optimized for transmission of tactile signals and wearable designs, could enable more intuitive and interpretable haptic feedback for augmentative limbs. This approach offers a pathway toward enhancing embodiment and motor control of augmentative artificial limbs.",

    "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
    "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

    "title": "The Interactive Effects of Negative Emotion and Reward Motivation on Visual Perception",
    "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

    "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

I\u2019m an Engineering student and I wanted to share my first real-world Python project. I built an automation tool that uses Computer Vision to handle a fishing mechanic.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>The script monitors a specific screen region in real-time. It uses a dual-check system to ensure accuracy:</p> <p>**Tesseract OCR:** Detects specific text prompts on screen.</p> <p>**OpenCV:** Uses HSV color filtering and contour detection to track movement and reflections.</p> <p>**Automation:** Uses PyAutoGUI for input and 'mss' for fast screen capturing.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This is for educational purposes, specifically for those interested in seeing how OpenCV can be applied to real-time screen monitoring and automation.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Unlike simple pixel-color bots, this implementation uses HSV masks to stay robust during different lighting conditions and weather changes in-game.</p> <p><strong>Source code</strong></p> <p>You can find the core logic here: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Gobenzor/58227b0f12183248d07314cd24ca9947\">https://gist.github.com/Gobenzor/58227b0f12183248d07314cd24ca9947</a></p> <p>Disclaimer: This project was created for educational purposes only to study Computer Vision and Automation. It was tested in a controlled environment and I do not encourage or support its use for gaining an unfair advantage in online multiplayer games. The code is documented in English.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggressive-Buyer267\"> /u/Aggressive-Buyer267 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qnn9o5/project_studentmade_fishing_bot_for_gta_5_using/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qnn9o5/project_studentmade_fishing_bot_for_gta_5_using/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Pre-myelinating oligodendrocyte ADGRG1 is required for axon ensheathment and CNS myelin formation",
    "content": "Myelin is essential for axonal health and rapid propagation of action potentials. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelination is initiated with axon ensheathment by pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes (preOLs), followed by iterative membrane wrapping and longitudinal extension along the axon. The molecular mechanisms that govern preOL development remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 (also called GPR56) as a key, evolutionarily conserved regulator of this process. We show that ADGRG1 is highly expressed in preOLs and that its conditional deletion in mouse preOLs leads to simplified preOL morphology and defective axon ensheathment, resulting in CNS hypomyelination. Live imaging in zebrafish demonstrated conserved function of Adgrg1 in axon ensheathment. Mechanistically, we show that ADGRG1 promotes preOL maturation by RhoA activation. Collectively, these findings reveal an ADGRG1-mediated RhoA signaling pathway that governs axon ensheathment and myelin formation.",

    "title": "Driving theta-gamma oscillations modulates extrasynaptic GABAergic tone: a tACS-TMS study",
    "content": "BACKGROUND: Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupled ({theta}{gamma}-PAC) oscillations in primary motor cortex (M1) have been shown to support motor skill acquisition. Past research has shown that driving gamma activity at the theta peak (TGP), but not the theta trough (TGT) using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) enhances motor learning (Akkad et al., 2021). However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this phase-specific effect remain unclear. METHODS: In a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over study, twenty-two healthy participants received 20 minutes of 75Hz/6Hz TGP-tACS, TGT-tACS, or sham stimulation over M1. We used paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess GABAergic and NMDAR-mediated activity before, during, and after tACS. Outcome measures included short-interval intracortical inhibition at 1ms (SICI1ms; extrasynaptic GABAergic tone) and 2.5ms (SICI2.5ms; synaptic GABAA activity), intracortical facilitation at 12ms (ICF12ms; NMDAR activity), and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude (corticospinal excitability). RESULTS: TGP-tACS selectively decreased SICI1ms, a putative marker of extrasynaptic GABAergic tone (main effect of Stimulation: p=.021), with significant differences between TGP and TGT during late stimulation (p=.047). No significant effects were observed on corticospinal excitability, synaptic GABAergic activity (SICI2.5ms), or NMDAR signalling (ICF12ms). CONCLUSIONS: Driving theta-gamma oscillations at the theta peak using tACS specifically modulates extrasynaptic GABAergic tone in M1 without affecting corticospinal excitability or synaptic inhibition. Given that reductions in GABAergic signalling supports motor learning, these findings provide a neurophysiological mechanism for the phase-specific behavioural effects of {theta}{gamma}-PAC tACS and suggest a potential therapeutic approach for facilitating motor recovery after stroke.",

    "content": "People can dynamically and adaptively update task goals in the face of task uncertainty. In this fMRI study, we aimed to investigate the modulation of neural task representations that subserve such flexible task control. On each trial, we asked people to perform one of nine image categorization tasks. During task preparation, participants had to actively infer varying levels of task uncertainty and dynamically modulate their task preparation accordingly. Multivariate pattern analyses demonstrated dissociable uncertainty-driven modulations of conjunctive and compositional task representations in the right frontoparietal network. Specifically, different sub-regions showed diminished conjunctive task representations when task uncertainty increased during task preparation. At the same time, we observed an active maintenance of compositional task representations, suggesting an adaptive cognitive strategy in facilitating compositional task reconfiguration. These findings suggest a mechanism of parallel control on conjunctive and compositional representations that allows for maximizing the advantages of both representational formats, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms underpinning human flexible task preparation.",

    "content": "Inducing neurogenesis from glia could permit circuit remodeling and neuron replacement in the brain. Indirect evidence suggests that glia-to-neuron reprogramming is feasible, but the dynamics of conversion have not been directly observed, and it remains unclear whether glia-derived cortical neurons can functionally integrate into brain circuits. Here, we use two-photon imaging to visualize the reprogramming of astroglia into induced neurons in the mouse cortex in vivo. We track the emergence of spontaneous neuron-like calcium transients in astrocyte-derived induced neurons, demonstrating their functional activity in vivo. Importantly, these induced neurons exhibit orientation tuned, visually evoked calcium responses, demonstrating their functional integration into cortical circuitry - a prerequisite for their utility in circuit repair. Thus, astrocytes can be recruited to generate functional neurons in the postnatal cortex, enabling circuit remodeling in perinatal injury or neurodevelopmental disorders without relying on external cellular sources.",

    "title": "Astrocyte diversity and aging in the mouse lemur primate brain",
    "content": "Astrocytes play key roles in maintaining brain homeostasis, metabolism, and neurovascular integrity, yet their diversity and age-related modulation remain insufficiently understood, particularly across primate lineages. While rodent studies have generated extensive knowledge, notable species differences highlight the need for comparative analyses in non-human primates. The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a small primate widely used in aging research, offers a valuable but underexplored model for studying astroglial aging. In this study, we characterized astrocyte distribution, morphology, and reactivity in 17 mouse lemurs aged 1.0 to 11.5 years using GFAP and vimentin immunohistochemistry. We identified marked regional and morphological heterogeneity, with dense astrocytic labeling in white matter, hippocampus, and sparse but diverse cortical populations. Distinct astrocyte subtypes (including fibrous, protoplasmic, projection, pial and subpial interlaminar, radial glia-like cells, tanycytes) were documented. Varicosity-bearing processes were common across multiple astroglial subtypes and may indicate altered physiological states. Quantitative analyses revealed pronounced age-related increases in astrocytic reactivity, particularly in white matter and interlaminar astrocytes. Cortical and hippocampal changes were comparatively modest. These findings indicate region-specific astrocytic vulnerability during aging and support the translational value of the mouse lemur for investigating glial aging in primates.",

    "title": "Chronic acoustic degradation via cochlear implants alters predictive processing of audiovisual speech",
    "content": "This study provides the first neurophysiological evidence of how cochlear implant (CI) input affects predictive processing during audiovisual language comprehension in deaf individuals. Using EEG, we compared 18 CI users with 18 normal-hearing (NH) controls during sentence comprehension where final word predictability was determined by high or low semantic constraint (HC vs. LC) of the preceding sentence frame. Between sentence frame and final word, a 800 ms silent gap was introduced. Mouth visibility was manipulated during sentence frames (visible or digitally occluded; V+ vs. V-), while the final words were always presented with the mouth visible. In NH participants, lower-beta power (12-15 Hz) in left frontal and central sensors decreased for HC vs. LC contexts during the pre-target silent gap, but only when the mouths was visible, suggesting active prediction generation. In CI users, this lower beta power decrease was absent. After final word presentation, both groups showed N400 predictability effects, indicating preserved prediction evaluation. However, CI users exhibited extended N400 effects in the V+ condition, suggesting additional processing demands. Across all participants, pre-target beta modulations correlated with language production abilities, supporting prediction-by-production frameworks. Within CI users, poorer audiometric thresholds correlated with larger N400 constraint effects, possibly indicating greater reliance on contextual prediction to compensate for degraded sensory input. These findings demonstrate that CI-mediated perception alters the neural mechanisms of prediction generation. The link between production skills and predictive mechanisms suggests that strengthening expressive language abilities may enhance predictive processing in CI users.",

    "title": "Electroencephalography signatures of motor error and stimulus-driven attention in electrical muscle stimulation-induced wrist movements under motor imagery",
    "content": "This study examines how electroencephalography (EEG) signatures are modulated during passive movements induced by electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). Specifically, we focused on three key factors: (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions (motor imagery and waiting). We tested how error-related neural responses are modulated by the mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs during motor imagery. To this end, we introduced a wrist-movement paradigm combining motor imagery with EMS. Participants either imagined wrist dorsiflexion toward visual targets or passively waited. EMS was then applied to induce passive wrist movements. EMS intensity and presentation rate were manipulated so that the magnitude of stepwise motor error (physical deviation from the target) and stimulation-driven attention varied inversely, allowing us to evaluate their respective neural effects. Event-related potential (ERP) components at approximately 700 ms reflected graded evaluation of motor error. An ERP component at approximately 300 ms was modulated primarily by EMS intensity and presentation rate, consistent with stimulus-driven attention. Mu-band suppression reflected the match between predicted and actual sensory inputs. Theta-band enhancement in the absence of motor imagery suggested increased sensory unpredictability due to the lack of internally generated predictions, whereas beta-band activity may have been related to fluctuations in state prediction. To our knowledge, the proposed motor imagery with the EMS wrist-movement paradigm is the first to investigate how (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions shape EEG signatures during passive, electrically induced movements. Understanding how these neural signals vary with mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of error processing and sensory prediction in the human brain.",

    "title": "Novel devaluation methods to explore habits in humans",
    "content": "Habits in humans are commonly studied through outcome devaluation paradigms, but most existing tasks fail to capture the robustness of habitual behavior seen in animal models. I introduce two novel behavioral tasks designed to overcome these limitations. In the first task, (\"shooting aliens task\", n = 45), I simplified an existing instrumental learning task and implemented a novel intra-block reversal method in which stimulus positions changed unexpectedly within blocks while maintaining the same stimulus-action mappings. Participants also completed a classical devaluation phase with explicit reward changes. In the second task (\"hands-attack task\", n = 44), which relied on real-life avoidance behavior, devaluation was achieved by reversing reward contingencies and allowing participants to inhibit the dominant avoidance response in favor of a more effortful counterattack. Across both tasks, overtrained conditions led to more errors and longer response times after devaluation, confirming increased insensitivity to outcome change. Intra-block reversals in the shooting aliens task produced stronger habitual signatures than standard whole-block devaluation, revealing a greater cost of overriding automatic responses. In the hands-attack task, even without prior training, participants showed clear markers of habitual behavior, suggesting that real-world action patterns can replicate key features of laboratory habits. Interestingly, participants were more accurate in overriding overtrained responses when attacks were highly familiar, possibly due to enhanced perceptual processing, although this came at the cost of longer response times. These findings introduce two complementary tools that address key limitations in current paradigms: the intra-block reversal increases habit sensitivity without inflating working memory demands, while the hands-attack task captures naturalistic habit expression without artificial training, using a single, ecologically valid session. Both are suited for clinical applications, particularly where time constraints or cognitive load limit the feasibility of traditional approaches.",

    "title": "Wing mechanosensory modulation of optic flow-sensitive descending neurons in butterflies",
    "content": "Visual motion processing in flying insects is strongly modulated by behavioural state, yet the mechanisms by which mechanosensory feedback contributes to this modulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that wing mechanosensation alone is sufficient to modulate a subset of optic flow-sensitive descending neurons (WFDNs) in butterflies. Airflow stimulation of the wings, mimicking flight conditions, increased baseline firing rates and reduced response latencies in WFDNs, without altering response gain or temporal frequency tuning. These effects indicate that mechanosensory modulation acts through mechanisms distinct from those governing other state-dependent changes in visual processing. Consistent with this interpretation, previous work has shown that baseline firing and response latency can be rapidly modulated, whereas gain changes arise through slower neuromodulatory pathways. Mechanosensory modulation was cell-type specific: the horizontally tuned WFDNL neuron was consistently affected across individuals, whereas other WFDN types were largely insensitive, likely reflecting the unilateral airflow stimuli used here. Interestingly, WFDNL modulation arose exclusively from mechanosensory input from the proximal area of the wing, not from distal wing deformation. This suggests that descending visual pathways require only coarse gain or excitability modulation rather than detailed information about wing shape or strain, leaving fast reflexive control of distal wing deformation to local ganglionic circuits. Together, our results demonstrate that wing mechanosensation selectively modulates visual descending pathways by altering excitability and timing rather than visual feature encoding, supporting the existence of multiple, parallel mechanisms for state-dependent visual modulation during flight.",

    "content": "Stress exposure early in life is an established risk factor for adult psychiatric illness, yet these disorders -- including anxiety disorders and depression -- show significant sex-dependence in prevalence, symptomatology, and treatment response. The biology underlying these differences remains largely unexplored and may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity in anxiety and depression. Here, we characterize the lasting impact of developmental stress on adulthood neurobiology and behavior in mice by combining analyses of multiple levels of brain function, including whole-brain c-Fos mapping, manganese-enhanced MRI and transcriptomics with advanced behavioral phenotyping. Across levels of investigation, we find distinct and often opposite effects of developmental stress depending on sex. These results together showcase the strong influence of sex on how early life adversity affects the onset of stress-related disorders. This work emphasizes the necessity of considering sex when investigating developmental and neurobiological underpinnings of stress-related disorders and displays a vast range of lasting effects of developmental stress on the brain, which provides a valuable resource for future studies aiming to improve psychiatric treatments.",

    "title": "Inhibition of Slc17a7 expressing neurons in the basolateral amygdala which project to the nucleus accumbens shapes the fidelity of motivated behavior",
    "content": "Adaptive behavior depends on the ability to form predictive associations between environmental cues and biologically relevant outcomes. Classical models posit that projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) promote reward seeking, whereas projections to the central amygdala facilitate defensive responding. However, accumulating evidence indicates that molecular identity and inhibitory dynamics introduce additional layers of functional heterogeneity within these pathways. Genetically defined subsets of BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons can drive either reward-related or aversive behaviors, and single-cell imaging studies show that cue-responsive BLA ensembles undergo an inhibitory shift as conditioning progresses. How these molecular and inhibitory mechanisms interact within defined projections to shape motivated behavior remains unclear. To address this, we examined Vglut1-expressing BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons (Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc), the predominant excitatory population within this pathway. Whole-cell electrophysiology revealed that reward conditioning increases inhibitory synaptic input onto Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons and reduces intrinsic excitability. Using a dual-recombinase chemogenetic strategy, we found that selective inhibition of this projection enhances acquisition of a cued reward task, increases instrumental reward seeking, and elevates reward valuation in a two-choice preference assay. Similar enhancement was observed in a fear-discrimination task, where inhibition of Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons improved differentiation between threat- and safety-associated cues. These findings identify inhibitory regulation of Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons as a key mechanism that strengthens stimulus-outcome associations. By demonstrating that conditioning-associated inhibitory plasticity modulates this major BLA output pathway, the work refines prevailing models of BLA[-&gt;]NAc function and highlights inhibition as an important contributor to the fidelity of motivated behavior.To address this, we examined Vglut1-expressing BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons (Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc), the predominant excitatory population within this pathway.

    "title": "A pathogenic AMPA receptor gating mutation disrupts synapse-mitochondrion axis and stalls synapse maturation",
    "content": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are central regulators of excitatory synaptic transmission and play critical roles in activity dependent synapse maturation and circuit development. De novo missense mutations in AMPAR subunits have been widely linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Despite this, how these variants lead to neuronal dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the consequences of a recurrent pathogenic mutation in the GluA1 subunit (GRIA1 p.A636T), which alters AMPAR gating properties and is associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. We developed a GluA1A636T knock-in mouse model, we show that GluA1A636T mice exhibit impairments in hippocampal dependent learning and working memory accompanied by reduced baseline activity of CA1 neurons in vivo. Mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomic analyses of juvenile and adult hippocampal samples revealed that the A636T mutation significantly alters synaptic protein expression at both ages. Notably, the mutation drives a robust upregulation of mitochondrial proteins specifically in adult mice. Consistent with this, dendritic mitochondria in adult GluA1A636T mice exhibited altered morphology and increased oxidative stress. Electrophysiological analyses further revealed abnormalities in synaptic function, including reduced basal excitatory transmission, persistence of functionally silent synapses in adulthood, and altered synaptic plasticity consistent with impaired synapse maturation. Together, these findings demonstrate that a pathogenic AMPAR gating mutation disrupts the coordinated development of synaptic and metabolic programs in the hippocampus, linking altered excitatory signaling to delayed mitochondrial stress and enduring circuit dysfunction. Our study provides a developmental framework for understanding how disease-associated AMPAR variants impair brain function and highlights synapse mitochondria coupling as a critical axis in glutamate receptor ionotropic (GRI) disorders.",

    "title": "Reconciling contradictory models of subthalamic nucleus contributions to basal ganglia beta oscillations",
    "content": "Recent computational studies of Parkinsons disease have yielded contradictory findings regarding the role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in pathological beta oscillations, with some models implicating STN as essential for beta generation and others suggesting that STN suppresses oscillations. This work addresses these discrepancies by systematically investigating how the specific features of the integrate-and-fire neurons used in these models influence simulated basal ganglia network dynamics. Using both rate models and spiking network simulations incorporating coupled subthalamopallidal and pallidostriatal circuits, we demonstrate that the choice between leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) and quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) models to represent STN neurons fundamentally impacts the phase relationship between STN and external globus pallidus prototypical (Proto) neuron populations. QIF STN neurons establish in-phase coupling with Proto neurons, which enhances beta oscillation amplitude, while LIF STN neurons develop anti-phase relationships, which suppresses beta power. Through intervention experiments and parameter sweeps across physiologically relevant firing rates, we show that these phase-related effects persist robustly across network conditions, and we mathematically establish conditions under which these results are guaranteed to hold. Our findings reveal that the fundamental mathematical structure underlying spike generation, rather than other biophysical details, determines whether the subthalamopallidal loop acts as a beta amplifier or suppressor. This mechanistic insight reconciles contradictory findings in the literature, demonstrates that seemingly minor modeling choices can have profound consequences for understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets, and offers predictions for determining which model framework reflects the biological reality.",

    "title": "Neural modes in motor cortex cycle over fast timescales",
    "content": "The embedding of low-dimensional latent states in the activity of large neuron populations has become a tenet of systems neuroscience. Despite the stability of these latent representations over time, the underlying activity of individual neurons is known to change both within experimental sessions and across days; yet, less attention has been devoted to changes in the coordinated activity of neuron populations on short timescales, particularly under conditions where networks must adapt quickly (e.g., during learning or after injury). To investigate, patterns of individual neuron contributions to population state dimensions in motor cortex were tracked over short blocks of repeated reaching trials. The number of distinct encoding patterns was consistently less than the typical dimensionality reported for motor cortex. Although the neuron population state space and dynamics were effectively conserved, these underlying encoding patterns changed in two ways: fast switches among themselves, as well as slow modifications over time. To explore whether these two drift timescales shared a common physiological mechanism, we analyzed the response of motor cortex to a causal perturbation. Direct electrical current was passed through two recording electrodes to terminate a small number of neurons, which evoked drift over both fast and slow timescales, both together and independently. While changes in fast switch rates were not necessarily associated with behavioral deficits, a significant increase in slow drift was accompanied by a decrease in behavioral performance. Together, these results reveal an additional timescale of drift in correlated population activity that could help guide the discovery of cellular and network mechanisms responsible for the maintenance, (re)learning, and recovery of low-dimensional structure in neuron populations.",

    "title": "The curse of dimensionality in motor cortex",
    "content": "Understanding how motor cortex generates movement is a foundational challenge in neuroscience. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), are widely used to transform high-dimensional neural data into a more interpretable, low-dimensional space. It is broadly assumed that the dimensionality of a particular motor task--that is, the number of principal components needed to explain a fixed fraction of variance--is an intrinsic property of the underlying neural dynamics, potentially modulated by task complexity. Here, we show that unsupervised estimates of dimensionality do not converge but instead scale with the number of recorded neurons. Across four animals, we found that while low-dimensional structure reflects changes in behavioral context, traditional metrics of dimensionality are relatively insensitive to increasingly complex movements. Rather, dimensionality increases with electrode count, exhibiting non-saturating growth as recordings scale to 1000 electrodes. While decoders trained on unsupervised subspaces showed only modest gains with scale, supervised methods leveraged additional electrodes to separate neural states more effectively. Surprisingly, the percentage of variance required for accurate supervised reach decoding became vanishingly small at high electrode counts (<0.1% at 1000 electrodes). Our results challenge current views on cortical dimensionality and highlight the divergent properties of supervised versus unsupervised learning, motivating careful consideration of appropriate computational methods as experimental data volumes scale.",

    "title": "Comprehensive 3D mapping reveals distinct spatial gradients of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen",
    "content": "In addition to spatially organized excitatory forebrain inputs along its mediolateral, dorsoventral, and anteroposterior axes, the striatum relies on cellular diversity to subserve its myriad processing functions. Distinct striatal GABAergic interneuron subtypes, including somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) interneurons likely subserve complementary computational roles. However, a detailed understanding of how these microcircuit components are distributed across striatal territories remains lacking. To address this gap, we generated a comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen using genetic labeling, brain-wide imaging, and voxel-wise quantification. We found that SST and TH interneurons were relatively enriched in the ventral caudoputamen, whereas PV interneurons were enriched dorsally. In addition, PV and TH interneurons exhibited opposing anteroposterior distribution patterns, with PV interneurons enriched posteriorly and TH interneurons showing a marked decline in density towards the striatal tail. Consequently, while the three interneuron subtypes displayed comparable densities in the functionally defined lateral striatum and anterior ventromedial striatum, PV interneurons predominated in the dorsomedial striatum and tail of striatum. We did not observe major sex differences. Together, these findings reinforce the view that the striatum is not a monolithic structure: in addition to structured excitatory inputs, inhibitory microcircuits themselves are differentially distributed across striatal territories, providing region-specific constraints on circuit computation. By integrating interneuron organization into existing anatomical frameworks, this atlas provides a foundation for linking striatal anatomy to function across behavioral domains.",

    "content": "Precise, anticipatory movements depend on the brain ability to generate motor commands in advance of immediate sensory input. Although the cerebellar cortex receives abundant sensory input via the mossy fiber pathway, the mechanisms by which continuous sensory signals are transformed or gated remain poorly understood. Here we show that molecular layer interneurons acquire persistent sensory-related activity in mice that develop anticipatory behavior. Employing a targeted lick interception task, we found that interneurons in lobule Crus I exhibit enhanced activity up to five seconds before movement onset locked to the spatial position of a continuously moving target independent of body movement. In more anticipatory mice, movement onset becomes linked to the dynamics of this persistent activity, whereas less anticipatory mice adjust their movements based on immediate sensory related input. Moreover, chemogenetic inhibition of Crus I, but not Crus II, impairs behavioral performance and delays lick onset without altering overall lick parameters.

    "title": "An entropic explanation of insistence on sameness in autism",
    "content": "PurposeAn information theory-based framework is proposed in attempt to explain insistence on sameness in autism as an instance of a general behavior pattern in which an individual tries to reduce surprise and uncertainty. It offers a new definition of autism as an impairment in which cognitive functions are restricted to discrimination, memorization and prediction of tangible properties of the environment.MethodsAn analogy between insistence on sameness and constrained minimization of the entropy metric is observed and examined for a set of assumptions that describe cognitive limitations of a person with autism. The metric is given by the formula DH(R, M) = H(R|M)+H(M|R), where R represents sequences of random stimuli, M is a memory that stores and retrieves them, and where H(\u00b7|\u00b7) denotes their conditional entropies interpreted as surprise and uncertainty, respectively.ResultsIt is first inferred that to minimize the metric an individual can learn about R (and store that knowledge in M) or can restrict R to the already known M. Then, it is concluded that insistence on sameness is a manifestation of the latter. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed framework: (1) Helps to quantify the concepts of surprise, uncertainty, sensory overload and deprivation, anxiety, comfort zone, disappointment, disorientation, pedantry, rigidness, observance or aberrant precision. (2) Leads to a list of guidelines for learning therapies and daily care routines, and allows them to be defined as optimization algorithms and implemented as programs for robotic live-in caregivers. (3) Can be validated with the help of a Turing test-like approach that requires no experiments involving individuals with autism.ConclusionThe framework\u2014if positively validated\u2014will provide advantages of both theoretical and practical importance: it explains the insistent on sameness as a consequence of cognitive restrictions and offers formal foundations and design guidelines for therapies aimed at improving self-reliance of individuals with autism in basic activities of daily living.",

    "title": "Clinical exome sequencing identifies novel gene variants associated with ischemic stroke in the Saudi Tabuk population",
    "content": "BackgroundVariants linked to the risk of ischemic stroke have been discovered through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). These variations frequently have little consequences that lack apparent biological significance. Hence, these findings demonstrate that exome sequencing can be highly relevant to stroke, even though stroke is a complex phenotype with various diseases and risk factors.MethodologyIn this case-control investigation, we used ARMS genotyping to investigate the distribution of polymorphic variations in genes associated with stroke susceptibility. In addition to examine the novel gene variations associated with ischemic stroke we utilized the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform for whole-exome sequencing (WES).ResultsResults identified 11 novel gene variants in the GSTT4 gene by targeted whole-exome sequencing, including one deletion GSTT4p.Asn232LysfsTer6, one insertion c.688_689insCG, and 9 SNVs c.699\u202fT\u202f>\u202fC, c.701C\u202f>\u202fG, c.708G\u202f>\u202fT, c.710\u202fT\u202f>\u202fG, c.712A\u202f>\u202fG, c.712A\u202f>\u202fG, c.718A\u202f>\u202fT, c.719G\u202f>\u202fA, c.721A\u202f>\u202fT, c.722G\u202f>\u202fT in the ischemic stroke patients. We also identified several rare, intermediate, and most common gene variants in cholesterol associated genes LDLR, LDLRAD2, LDLRAD3, APOA2, APOA3, APOA4, APOA5, and PCSK9. Also, several common gene variants were reported in MTHFR, KLF14, eNOS3, and ACE by whole-exome sequencing. Furthermore, the eNOS3-GG and eNOS3-GT genotypes were associated with susceptibility to ischemic stroke (OR\u202f=\u202f1.95, p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionThis case-control study identified 11 novel GSTT4 variants and several known polymorphisms associated with ischemic stroke risk in Saudi patients. These findings highlight population-specific genetic factors that warrant further functional and large-scale validation.",

    "title": "The complex impact of auditory error direction, magnitude, and exposure on corrective responses",
    "content": "PurposeWhen encountering errors, the brain produces within-production corrective responses to compensate for the errors. The brain also develops adaptive responses to ensure the accuracy of future productions. This study examined the impact of the number of exposures to errors with different characteristics on corrective and adaptive responses.MethodsWe designed a compensation paradigm to apply three perturbation magnitudes in two directions within the two-dimensional formant space: (1) a concurrent increase in the first formant and decrease in the second formant, acoustically shifting /\u025b/ toward /\u00e6/ (\u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations), and (2) a concurrent increase in the first formant and increase in the second formant, shifting /\u025b/ toward the outside of the vowel space (\u025b-to-out perturbations). To calculate corrective responses in perturbed trials, we determined the difference between formants in the late (300\u2013400 ms) and early (0\u2013100 ms) intervals of the vowel. We estimated adaptive responses in unperturbed trials by calculating formant changes in the early interval of the post-perturbation trial relative to the early interval of the pre-perturbation trial. We examined the responses in the first and second halves of trials in each condition to determine the effect of exposure to perturbations.ResultsWe found that (1) corrective responses to \u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations were larger and proportionally larger for small perturbations in the first half of perturbed trials, (2) adaptive responses were measurable after exposure to a single perturbation, and (3) strikingly, both corrective and adaptive response directions were generally in the participant-specific \u025b-\u026a direction, regardless of the perturbation direction. This preferred response direction was in the opposite direction of the \u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations but was perpendicular to the \u025b-to-out perturbations.ConclusionOur findings suggest that the brain responds more to small and natural-sounding errors (\u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations) than large and unnatural errors (\u025b-to-out perturbations). The brain\u2019s biases in selecting movements may influence error compensation, leading to responses that prioritize preferred movements even when they do not fully correct errors (e.g., responding in the \u025b-\u026a direction for \u025b-to-out perturbations). Finally, as the brain encounters more unexpected errors, it may evaluate them differently and respond less to them.",

    "title": "Astrocyte-gated multi-timescale plasticity for online continual learning in deep spiking neural networks",
    "content": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a paradigm of energy-efficient, event-driven computation that is well-suited for processing asynchronous sensory streams. However, training deep SNNs robustly in an online and continual manner remains a formidable challenge. Standard Backpropagation-through-Time (BPTT) suffers from a prohibitive memory bottleneck due to the storage of temporal histories, while local plasticity rules often fail to balance the trade-off between rapid acquisition of new information and the retention of old knowledge (the stability-plasticity dilemma). Motivated by the tripartite synapse in biological systems, where astrocytes regulate synaptic efficacy over slow timescales, we propose Astrocyte-Gated Multi-Timescale Plasticity (AGMP). AGMP is a scalable, online learning framework that augments eligibility traces with a broadcast teaching signal and a novel astrocyte-mediated gating mechanism. This slow astrocytic variable integrates neuronal activity to dynamically modulate plasticity, suppressing updates in stable regimes while enabling adaptation during distribution shifts. We evaluate AGMP on a comprehensive suite of neuromorphic benchmarks, including N-Caltech101, DVS128 Gesture, and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD). Experimental results demonstrate that AGMP achieves accuracy competitive with offline BPTT while maintaining constant O(1) temporal memory complexity. Furthermore, in rigorous Class-Incremental Continual Learning scenarios (e.g., Split CIFAR-100), AGMP significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting without requiring replay buffers, outperforming state-of-the-art online learning rules. This work provides a biologically grounded, hardware-friendly path toward autonomous learning agents capable of lifelong adaptation.",
