    "title": "Systematizing LLM Persona Design: A Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI Companion Applications",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.02979v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The design and application of LLM-based personas in AI companionship is a rapidly expanding but fragmented field, spanning from virtual emotional compan- ions and game NPCs to embodied functional robots. This diversity in objectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applica- tions in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from \"feeling\" to \"thinking and acting\" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.",

    "title": "A Survey of Driver Distraction and Inattention in Popular Commercial Software-Defined Vehicles",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.02891v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As the automotive industry embraces software-defined vehicles (SDVs), the role of user interface (UI) design in ensuring driver safety has become increasingly significant. In crashes related to distracted driving, over 90% did not involve cellphone use but were related to UI controls. However, many of the existing UI SDV implementations do not consider Drive Distraction and Inattention (DDI), which is reflected in many popular commercial vehicles. This paper investigates the impact of UI designs on driver distraction and inattention within the context of SDVs. Through a survey of popular commercial vehicles, we identify UI features that potentially increase cognitive load and evaluate design strategies to mitigate these risks. This survey highlights the need for UI designs that balance advanced software functionalities with driver-cognitive ergonomics. Findings aim to provide valuable guidance to researchers and OEMs to contribute to the field of automotive UI, contributing to the broader discussion on enhancing vehicular safety in the software-centric automotive era.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.02842v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many organisations pursue digital transformation to enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual efforts, and optimise processes by automation and digital tools. To achieve this, a comprehensive understanding of their unique needs is required. However, traditional methods, such as expert interviews, while effective, face several challenges, including scheduling conflicts, resource constraints, inconsistency, etc. To tackle these issues, we investigate the use of a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered chatbot to acquire organisations' digital transformation needs. Specifically, the chatbot integrates workflow-based instruction with LLM's planning and reasoning capabilities, enabling it to function as a virtual expert and conduct interviews. We detail the chatbot's features and its implementation. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that the chatbot performs as designed, effectively following predefined workflows and supporting user interactions with areas for improvement. We conclude by discussing the implications of employing chatbots to elicit user information, emphasizing their potential and limitations.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.02839v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Objective: Radiology residents require timely, personalized feedback to develop accurate image analysis and reporting skills. Increasing clinical workload often limits attendings' ability to provide guidance. This study evaluates a HIPAA-compliant GPT-4o system that delivers automated feedback on breast imaging reports drafted by residents in real clinical settings.\n  Methods: We analyzed 5,000 resident-attending report pairs from routine practice at a multi-site U.S. health system. GPT-4o was prompted with clinical instructions to identify common errors and provide feedback. A reader study using 100 report pairs was conducted. Four attending radiologists and four residents independently reviewed each pair, determined whether predefined error types were present, and rated GPT-4o's feedback as helpful or not. Agreement between GPT and readers was assessed using percent match. Inter-reader reliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha. Educational value was measured as the proportion of cases rated helpful.\n  Results: Three common error types were identified: (1) omission or addition of key findings, (2) incorrect use or omission of technical descriptors, and (3) final assessment inconsistent with findings. GPT-4o showed strong agreement with attending consensus: 90.5%, 78.3%, and 90.4% across error types. Inter-reader reliability showed moderate variability ({\\alpha} = 0.767, 0.595, 0.567), and replacing a human reader with GPT-4o did not significantly affect agreement ({\\Delta} = -0.004 to 0.002). GPT's feedback was rated helpful in most cases: 89.8%, 83.0%, and 92.0%.\n  Discussion: ChatGPT-4o can reliably identify key educational errors. It may serve as a scalable tool to support radiology education.",

The framework is designed to improve risk awareness and preparedness among various stakeholders, including citizens, local authorities, and emergency responders. Using immersive XR technologies, the training experience simulates real-world emergency scenarios, contributing to active participation and a deeper understanding of potential hazards and especially for floods. The framework highlights the importance of stakeholder participation in its development, ensuring that training modules are customized to address the specific needs of different user groups. The iterative approach of the framework supports ongoing refinement through user feedback and performance data, thus improving the overall effectiveness of risk training initiatives. This work outlines the methodological phases involved in the framework's implementation, including i) user flow mapping, ii) scenario selection, and iii) performance evaluation, with a focus on the pilot application in Senigallia, Italy. The findings underscore the potential of XR technologies to transform urban risk training, promoting a culture of preparedness and resilience against urban hazards.",

Personalized transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has gained growing attention due to the substantial inter-individual variability in brain anatomy and physiology. While previous reviews have discussed the physiological mechanisms and clinical applications of tES, there remains a critical gap in up-to-date syntheses focused on the computational modeling frameworks that enable individualized stimulation optimization. Approach. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in computational techniques supporting personalized tES. We systematically examine developments in forward modeling for simulating individualized electric fields, as well as inverse modeling approaches for optimizing stimulation parameters. We critically evaluate progress in head modeling pipelines, optimization algorithms, and the integration of multimodal brain data. Main results. Recent advances have substantially accelerated the construction of subject-specific head conductor models and expanded the landscape of optimization methods, including multi-objective optimization and brain network-informed optimization. These advances allow for dynamic and individualized stimulation planning, moving beyond empirical trial-and-error approaches.Significance. By integrating the latest developments in computational modeling for personalized tES, this review highlights current challenges, emerging opportunities, and future directions for achieving precision neuromodulation in both research and clinical contexts.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.00730v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.",

However, because the stimuli of these datasets typically live within a common naturalistic visual distribution, they do not allow for strict out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization tests which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the same eight NSD participants for 284 synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, we provide a proof of principle that OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with the original NSD data; we demonstrate that the degree of OOD (quantified as the distance between a set of responses and the training data used for modeling) is predictive of the magnitude of model failures; and we show that less strict OOD generalization tests can can be usefully applied even within the domain of naturalistic stimuli. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.",

The system's diverse behaviors are presented, along with the mathematical reasoning behind its chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics as determined by the structure of the coupled equations. The system is found to be multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity. This uncertainty and its potential effect on the synchronization of biological neurons may have significant implications for understanding human behavior and neurological disease.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.03643v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When people pursue rewards in stochastic environments, they often match their choice frequencies to the observed target frequencies, even when this policy is demonstrably sub-optimal. We used a ``hide and seek'' task to evaluate this behavior under conditions where pursuit (seeking) could be toggled to avoidance (hiding), while leaving the probability distribution fixed, or varying complexity by changing the number of possible choices. We developed a model for participant choice built from choice frequency histograms treated as vectors. We posited the existence of a probability antimatching strategy for avoidance (hiding) rounds, and formalized this as a vector reflection of probability matching. We found that only two basis policies: matching/antimatching and maximizing/minimizing were sufficient to account for participant choices across a range of room numbers and opponent probability distributions. This schema requires only that people have the ability to remember the relative frequency of the different outcomes. With this knowledge simple operations can construct the maximizing and minimizing policies as well as matching and antimatching strategies. A mixture of these two policies captures human choice patterns in a stochastic environment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.03502v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Cortical circuits exhibit high levels of response diversity, even across apparently uniform neuronal populations. While emerging data-driven approaches exploit this heterogeneity to infer effective models of cortical circuit computation (e.g. Genkin et al. Nature 2025), the power of response diversity to enable inference of mechanistic circuit models is largely unexplored. Within the landscape of cortical circuit models, spiking neuron networks in the balanced state naturally exhibit high levels of response and tuning diversity emerging from their internal dynamics. A statistical theory for this emergent tuning heterogeneity, however, has only been formulated for binary spin models (Vreeswijk & Sompolinsky, 2005). Here we present a formulation of feature-tuned balanced state networks that allows for arbitrary and diverse dynamics of postsynaptic currents and variable levels of heterogeneity in cellular excitability but nevertheless is analytically exactly tractable with respect to the emergent tuning curve heterogeneity. Using this framework, we present a case study demonstrating that, for a wide range of parameters even the population mean response is non-universal and sensitive to mechanistic circuit details. As our theory enables exactly and analytically obtaining the likelihood-function of tuning heterogeneity given circuit parameters, we argue that it forms a powerful and rigorous basis for neural circuit inference.",

    "title": "FAPEX: Fractional Amplitude-Phase Expressor for Robust Cross-Subject Seizure Prediction",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.03263v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Precise, generalizable subject-agnostic seizure prediction (SASP) remains a fundamental challenge due to the intrinsic complexity and significant spectral variability of electrophysiological signals across individuals and recording modalities. We propose FAPEX, a novel architecture that introduces a learnable fractional neural frame operator (FrNFO) for adaptive time-frequency decomposition. Unlike conventional models that exhibit spectral bias toward low frequencies, our FrNFO employs fractional-order convolutions to capture both high and low-frequency dynamics, achieving approximately 10% improvement in F1-score and sensitivity over state-of-the-art baselines. The FrNFO enables the extraction of instantaneous phase and amplitude representations that are particularly informative for preictal biomarker discovery and enhance out-of-distribution generalization. FAPEX further integrates structural state-space modeling and channelwise attention, allowing it to handle heterogeneous electrode montages. Evaluated across 12 benchmarks spanning species (human, rat, dog, macaque) and modalities (Scalp-EEG, SEEG, ECoG, LFP), FAPEX consistently outperforms 23 supervised and 10 self-supervised baselines under nested cross-validation, with gains of up to 15% in sensitivity on complex cross-domain scenarios. It further demonstrates superior performance in several external validation cohorts. To our knowledge, these establish FAPEX as the first epilepsy model to show consistent superiority in SASP, offering a promising solution for discovering epileptic biomarker evidence supporting the existence of a distinct and identifiable preictal state and clinical translation.",

RM performance with the LL was assessed before, immediately after, and 24 h post-intervention. Response time of RM sequences was faster in the UL group than the NO group in the posttest. Response time improved significantly in the posttest and retest compared to the pretest in all groups, but it improved significantly in the retest compared to the posttest only in the NO group. The percentage of fails to reach within 1 s decreased across all time points in all groups. The combination of practice of the RM sequence with the UL and the cognitive engagement during RM sequence observation contributes to ipsilateral transfer from the UL to the LL.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "content": "BackgroundA child\u2019s early years of life are a critical period for brain development, and malnutrition at this stage is associated with irreversible developmental delays. Developmental delays can be affected by maternal, child, and household factors. This study examined the association between acute malnutrition relapse and neurodevelopmental outcomes among children under 5 years old in Nairobi\u2019s informal settlements.MethodologyThe study used a comparative cross-sectional design that was hospital-based and was carried out in Viwandani and Korogocho informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. The three groups that were compared were children under 5 years old who had never suffered acute malnutrition, those who had the first episode of acute malnutrition, and those who had acute malnutrition relapse. Relapse in acute malnutrition was defined as wasting within 6 months after exiting treatment, as per the recommended discharge criteria (Council of Research and Technical Advice for Acute Malnutrition, CORTASAM). The study used both quantitative and qualitative methods, and the purposive sampling technique was used in both methods. The Malawi Development Assessment Tool (MDAT) assessed the neurodevelopment outcomes. Quantitative data is presented at the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate levels. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically, and predetermined themes and emerging themes were identified and added.ResultsAcute malnutrition relapse was a significant predictor of neurodevelopment outcomes among children under 5 years old. Children who had either never relapsed from acute malnutrition or had normal nutrition status were 2.08 times more likely to have normal neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to children who had relapsed [AOR\u202f=\u202f2.08; CI:1.11, 3.90; p-value, 0.02]. Maternal postpartum depression and child maturity status at birth were also significant predictors of neurodevelopmental outcomes among children under 5 years in Nairobi informal settlements [AOR\u202f=\u202f3.62; CI:1.86, 7.04; p-value < 0.001], [AOR\u202f=\u202f2.93; CI:1.21, 7.12; p-value, 0.02], respectively. The qualitative findings further showed that breastfeeding, sanitation, and diarrhea have an association with children\u2019s neurodevelopmental outcomes.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that children under five who experience relapses due to acute malnutrition exhibit significantly delayed neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to those who do not relapse. Furthermore, qualitative findings showed that breastfeeding, sanitation, and diarrhea have an association with children\u2019s neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

However, its deployment faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, robustness, and hardware efficiency, particularly concerning optimal electrode configuration, discriminative feature extraction, and classifier generalization.MethodsTo address these challenges, this study systematically evaluates thirteen entropy measures\u2014including spectral entropy (SpEn), refined composite multiscale entropy, fuzzy entropy, and sample entropy (SaEn) etc.\u2014alongside six classifiers (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forests and Support Vector Machines etc.) for person authentication. Using 32-channel EEG recordings from 26 healthy participants under rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), we quantified the impact of electrode selection and feature-classifier pairing.ResultsKey findings demonstrate: QDA classifier achieved peak performance of 96.8% accuracy using 30 electrodes. Critically, a streamlined 9-electrode portable configuration retained 96.1% accuracy, demonstrating robust performance with reduced hardware requirements. SpEn measure exhibited superior biometric discriminability compared with other entropy measures, exceeding SaEn by 13.8 percentage points.ConclusionThese results advance the design of portable EEG biometric devices while highlighting entropy features\u2019 scalability.",

    "title": "Impact of ischemic lesion on sleep related connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex",
    "content": "Ischemic events can cause cell death and tissue loss, leading to the impairment of neural circuitry by disconnection of its neural substrates. However, the highly plastic properties of the nervous system can provide recovery by boosting circuital redundancies or triggering functional adaptation/repurposing of closely related networks. In this context, understanding how ischemic brain lesions reorganize circuits directly or indirectly connected to the injury site is crucial for developing therapeutic approaches, particularly neuroprostheses based on neurostimulation for brain-rewiring. Furthermore, it is also fundamental to consider the sleep\u2013wake cycle in such an inquiry, considering its well-established role as bearer of key mechanisms of neuroplasticity. This study aimed to investigate how an ischemic lesion in the rat\u2019s primary motor cortex affects the connectivity of areas involved in the sensorimotor loop, specifically the premotor cortex (RFA) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), during sleep. We analyzed Local Field Potentials recorded during slow-wave sleep in rats with and without ischemic lesions. Functional connectivity and cross-frequency interactions were quantified using Phase Locking Value (PLV) and Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) analyses, respectively. Our findings revealed a marked increase in PAC 7\u202fdays after the lesion, followed by a partial return toward baseline levels at 14\u202fdays post-lesion. These results suggest a transient reorganization of network dynamics associated with early recovery processes. The observed changes provide insights into spontaneous post-stroke plasticity during sleep and identify potential electrophysiological biomarkers of recovery. Our findings may contribute to the design of sleep-integrated neurostimulation strategies to promote motor rehabilitation after stroke.",

Using a matched-stimulus driving paradigm to isolate engagement from sensory input, we recorded whole-brain EEG while participants performed a manual control task and passively viewed a replay of their own performance. Manual control elicited distinct spectral signatures, including stronger frontal midline theta power and, paradoxically, greater occipital alpha power, consistent with heightened cognitive control and active attentional filtering. While a classifier could distinguish these states with high within-subject accuracy, performance declined in cross-subject validation, highlighting inter-individual variability. These findings delineate the distinct neural signatures of active versus passive engagement under controlled conditions.

    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for In Vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Data",
    "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

    "content": "While machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to detection and prediction tasks in clinical data, most methods rely on high-resolution data, which is not routinely available in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and perform poorly when faced with class imbalance. Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "title": "Neural Dynamics Underlying Repeated Learning of Visual Image Sequences",
    "content": "Humans possess a remarkable ability to recognize visual objects with high fidelity, supported by complex neural mechanisms underlying memory retrieval. Event-related potential (ERP) studies have identified two key neural signatures of recognition memory: the parietal old/new effect and the frontal old/new effect. Despite extensive research on these ERP components, the extent to which these components reflect distinct memory processes remains debated. In the present study, we investigated how repetitive learning modulates these ERP components. Participants repeatedly studied a fixed list of 32 real-world images across up to five study-test repetitions while EEG was recorded. Additionally, a separate set size 1 condition served as a proxy for working memory. Our results showed that with increased repetitions, the parietal old/new effect exhibited enhanced amplitude and earlier peak latency, reflecting more efficient retrieval of well-learned memories. In contrast, the frontal old/new effect remained unchanged in both amplitude and timing. These findings suggest that the parietal old/new effect is a sensitive neural marker of learning-related changes in long-term memory representations, while the frontal effect is less influenced by repetition. Additionally, despite similarly high accuracy between the well-practiced set size 32 condition and the set size 1 working memory condition, both parietal and frontal old/new effects peaked significantly earlier for set size 1, suggesting that access to working memory is substantially faster than even well-practiced long-term memory. Together, our results highlight the unique role of the parietal old/new effect, but not the frontal old/new effect, in repetitive learning, despite both components being important for successful recognition of learnt visual stimuli.",

    "content": "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study brain function, yet its biophysiological basis remains incompletely understood. Building on our recent work, we investigated how EEG activity and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) are related to one another, and how they jointly underpin rs-fMRI metrics. Using a multimodal dataset with macrovascular correction applied to all rs-fMRI metrics, we first examined associations between EEG metrics and CMRO2, then applied mediation analysis to evaluate how CMRO2 mediates EEG-fMRI associations. We found that bandlimited EEG theta and alphafractional power was significantly associated with CMRO2. Bandlimited EEG coherence was also associated with CMRO2 across all the bands. Bandlimited EEG fractional power and coherence were also significantly associated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in a manner that varied by frequency. EEG broadband temporal complexity was positively associated with CMRO2; and EEG coherence was negatively associated with OEF. Notably, there are pronounced sex differences in these relationships, which suggests that the biophysical underpinnings of rs-fMRI are sex dependent. Moreover, the baseline metabolic and hemodynamic variables did partially mediate EEG-fMRI associations, with CMRO2 serving as the primary mediator. However, most of the mediations are partial, highlighting the complex interplay among electrophysiological activity, oxidative metabolism, and hemodynamics. This study advances our understanding of the biophysical basis of rs-fMRI and provides a foundation for developing sex-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.",

    "title": "Feedforward representation of face information in the fusiform face area revealed by VASO 7T layer fMRI",
    "content": "Recognizing faces is a critical cognitive process in social interaction. Face recognition has been extensively studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ranging from large coverage studies comprehensively examining the entire face pathway to high-resolution laminar-specific (layer) fMRI studies probing feedforward and feedback signals in early visual and face-selective areas during particular face processing. However, it is still unclear which brain region structures face information in the face pathway. To further elucidate this mechanism, we investigated fusiform face area (FFA) during passive face image presentation using a whole-brain vascular space occupancy (VASO) 7T layer fMRI open dataset combined with multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). We analysed lateral occipital cortex (LOC) as a control region and BOLD data in the dataset as a control contrast. We trained multiple binary classification decoders with various image categories (e.g., face vs. others, house vs. others) and three cortical layer groups independently to assess information representation across cortical depths. Our results revealed that decoding accuracies in VASO data peaked in the middle layer of FFA, suggesting feedforward signature specifically during face processing. This effect was not observed in LOC or in decoders for other image categories. These findings indicate that face information is structured prior to processing in the FFA, consistent with previous reports suggesting that face-related features are partially extracted before reaching higher-level face areas. Overall, this study highlights the potential of combining high-specificity VASO layer-fMRI with high-sensitivity MVPA to dissect cortical information flow.",

    "title": "Limited Effects of Isolated Congenital Anosmia on Cerebral White Matter Morphology",
    "content": "Lack of sensory input is associated with alterations in brain morphology; mainly in or near cerebral regions normally devoted to processing of the missing sense. We have in multiple studies demonstrated that the only consistent morphological finding within the gray matter of individuals born without the sense of smell (isolated congenital anosmia; ICA), are changes in or near the olfactory sulcus. For the connecting tissue of the brain, the white matter (WM), previous studies have yielded inconsistent findings. Here, we show that individuals with ICA (n=49) exhibit alterations in WM volume as compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Consistent evidence from both voxel-based morphometry and multi-voxel pattern analysis shows that individuals with ICA show decreased WM in areas surrounding the olfactory sulcus. Importantly, no WM alterations were found in areas surrounding the olfactory (piriform) cortex. In contrast to congenital sensory loss in other systems, we show that morphological alterations due to lifelong olfactory deprivation are limited. Alterations are primarily localized around the olfactory sulcus and likely due to the absence of olfactory bulbs. A possible explanation for the lack of major morphological alterations in individuals with congenital anosmia is that the olfactory regions may be recruited for non-olfactory functions.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "content": "ObjectivesMost patients with new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) subsequently develop drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) with multiple seizure foci and are not the typical candidates for resective surgery. We report the first case of DRE developing after cryptogenic-NORSE (C-NORSE) that was successfully treated using deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS).MethodsA 52-year-old man developed C-NORSE at the age of 45\u2009years and presented with sequelae of DRE and cognitive dysfunction despite anti-seizure medications and immunotherapy administration. Seizure semiology comprised palpitations, chills, and nausea, followed by impairment of awareness with oral automatism multiple times a day. Video-electroencephalogram monitoring (vEEG) showed bilateral independent electrographic seizures (ESz) in the fronto-temporal areas. He underwent ANT-DBS. Preoperative and postoperative vEEG recordings for 3\u2009days were compared.ResultsPreoperative vEEG showed 11 clinical seizures correlated with ESz. The duration of ESz ranged from 55 to 213\u2009s (median, 81\u2009s). Three months after ANT-DBS stimulation, vEEG showed four subclinical ESz episodes lasting from 22 to 31\u2009s (median, 25.5\u2009s) (Mann\u2013Whitney U test, p\u2009=\u20090.001). The patient had not developed an overt clinical seizure until the last follow-up at 9\u2009months. No adverse events were observed during treatment.ConclusionANT-DBS is an effective treatment option for DRE after NORSE, particularly when the epileptogenic network is located in the temporal lobe. A detailed evaluation using vEEG is useful for identifying the epileptogenic foci and assessing therapeutic outcome. Immunomodulatory mechanisms via cytokines could play roles in the pathogenesis of development of DRE after NORSE and seizure suppression effect of ANT-DBS.",

    "title": "The trade-off between maximizing reconstruction and physiological interpretation of muscle synergies with autoencoders",
    "content": "IntroductionIn neuroscience, the muscle synergy method is a widely known computational approach for studying motor control from electromyographic (EMG) recordings. Standard algorithms for synergy extraction rely on a linearity assumption for synergy combination. However, the interactions between muscle groups and movement dynamics often exhibit non-linear characteristics, suggesting the need for alternative approaches. In this context, autoencoders (AEs) have been proposed as promising tools. However, previous studies focused on the reconstruction accuracy optimization and not on the structure of the synergies, and the influence of AE design parameters has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to explore the impact of different activation functions on the effectiveness of AEs.MethodsTo this end, we used a rich dataset of upper-limb EMG signals recorded from 16 muscles in 15 participants performing reaching movements toward 9 targets across 5 planes. We evaluated the effects of combining four activation functions in the encoder and decoder layers\u2014linear, ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh\u2014and compared to standard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).ResultsOur findings show that the extracted synergies are highly sensitive to the AE architecture. Notably, the configurations obtaining the best signal reconstruction do not correspond to the most physiologically meaningful synergies, which were instead achieved with the ReLU+tanh configuration.DiscussionThis suggests that optimizing reconstruction accuracy may result in non-interpretable synergy structures. This research emphasizes the role of non-linear techniques in extracting muscle synergy from different datasets (e.g., lower limbs, full-body movements, patient populations) and identifies the optimal combination of transfer functions for the encoder and decoder layers.",

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "A Pilot Study on Fabric-Based Pneumatic Soft Gloves for Assisting Patients With Severe Brachial Plexus Injury",
    "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

Medical devices may become a beneficiary of this trend, as open-source medical device development has the potential to reduce costs, democratize patient access, and provide continued support to abandoned devices from failed companies. Unlike the consumer device market, the medical device market is highly regulated and involves considerable manufacturer liability that may limit the use of open-source technology. This review of open-source medical device development explores the current state of development in research and clinical products and suggests best practices for creating sustainable and effective open-source medical devices.",

    "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "title": "Approaches for retraining sEMG classifiers for upper-limb prostheses",
    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "title": "Fully Automated EEG Source Imaging Using Structured Sparsity for Single and Multiple Synchronous Epileptic Activities",
    "content": "Accurate localization of epileptic zones from High-Resolution ElectroEncephaloGraphy (HR-EEG) data can be challenging, especially when multiple synchronous zones are involved, and is highly dependent on the chosen EEG Source Imaging (ESI) method. Since a given scalp-level electrical pattern can result from multiple source configurations, ESI methods address this ill-posed inverse problem by imposing constraints on the structure of underlying sources. Here, we present an efficient approach that imposes sparsity on both the source-level activity and its spatial gradient. Unlike other methods that generally require a heuristic choice of a regularization parameter that balances between data fidelity and constraints, our method iteratively adjusts the parameter value based on the noise level in a fully automated way. The performance of the new method is evaluated across different scenarios of realistic synthetic HR-EEG data, including unifocal and synchronous multifocal cortical epileptic activity. Based on multiple performance indices, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods in accurately reconstructing epileptic sources. We also show that the method reduces polarity artifacts responsible for ghost sources and spatial discontinuities. Its ability to recover homogeneous, well-delineated regions of activity is further confirmed using real EEG data capturing a typical absence seizure.",

    "title": "Choosing the best or avoiding the worst: complementary and opponent value signals in the human brain",
    "content": "Whether the brain encodes the subjective value of pleasant and unpleasant situations via a single integrated circuit or through distinct pathways remains unresolved. It is also unclear how neural value signals guide choices when the context involves choosing the most favorable option or avoiding the most unfavorable one. To address these questions, we recorded intracerebral activity from 27 participants as they first rated pleasant and unpleasant scenarios and then made binary choices across all combinations of item domain (pleasant/unpleasant) and choice frame (choose best/worst). Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) broadband gamma activity (BGA, 50 to150 Hz) tracked the value of pleasant items during rating and pre-choice, correlating positively with the most pleasant item irrespective of choice frame. Similarly, anterior insula (aIns) BGA tracked the value of unpleasant items during rating and pre-choice, correlating negatively with the most unpleasant item irrespective of choice frame. The difference in relative value correlations between the vmPFC and aIns was larger for choices involving a conflict between item domain and choice frame, consistent with slower response times and choices less aligned with value differences in these trials. These findings reveal dissociable yet complementary neural systems for pleasant and unpleasant valuation and highlight how such signals may guide flexible decision making across contexts.",

    "title": "Structural and functional brain asymmetry in relation to heterogeneous causes of situs inversus totalis",
    "content": "Various aspects of brain organization differ between the left and right hemispheres. Clues to the developmental origins of these asymmetries may be gained through associations with situs inversus totalis (SIT), a rare condition in which visceral organs are reversed on the left-right axis. In the largest previous brain imaging analyses of SIT (38 cases, 38 controls from Belgium), typical functional asymmetries such as left-hemisphere language dominance were mostly unaltered, but various aspects of asymmetrical cerebral structure - petalia, bending, and posterior venous anatomy - were often reversed in this condition. SIT can be a monogenic trait that arises from rare genetic variants, usually affecting motile cilia which help to create the embryonic left-right body axis. However, most SIT cases do not have obvious genetic causes and may arise from environmental or random effects during embryogenesis. We sequenced the genomes of 23 SIT cases and 23 controls from the Belgian brain imaging dataset and pooled with prior data from 15 cases and 15 controls. We aimed to discover whether there are altered brain asymmetries in SIT cases with disruptive DNA variants in ciliary genes, or in other types of genes, as compared to genetically unsolved cases. In total, 19 cases had likely causal variants affecting ciliary function, while 19 cases remained genetically unsolved. Functional and structural brain asymmetries were not significantly different in genetically solved versus unsolved SIT cases. Therefore, functional brain asymmetries seem largely independent of known mechanisms of visceral situs formation, while structural brain torque is altered in SIT regardless of the presence or absence of overt genetic causes.",

    "title": "A Caveat Regarding the Unfolding Argument: Implications of Plasticity for Computational Theories of Consciousness",
    "content": "The unfolding argument in the neuroscience of consciousness posits that causal structure cannot account for consciousness because any recurrent neural network (RNN) can be \"unfolded\" into a functionally equivalent feedforward neural network (FNN) with identical input-output behavior. Subsequent debate has focused on dynamical properties and philosophy of science critiques. We examine a novel caveat to the unfolding argument for RNN systems with plasticity in the connection weights. We demonstrate through rigorous mathematical proofs that plasticity negates the functional equivalence between RNN and FNN. Our proofs address history-dependent plasticity, dynamical systems analysis, information-theoretic considerations, perturbational stability, complexity growth, and resource limitations. We demonstrate that neuronal systems that possess properties such as plasticity, history-dependence, and complex temporal information encoding have features that cannot be captured by a static FNN. Our findings delineate limitations of the unfolding argument that apply if consciousness arises from temporally extended dynamic neural processes rather than static input-output mappings. This work has implications for various theories of consciousness, and for the fields of computational neuroscience and philosophy of mind more generally, providing new constraints for theories of consciousness.",

    "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

    "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

    "title": "Spontaneous neural activity changes in minimal hepatic encephalopathy before and 1 month after liver transplantation",
    "content": "Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is the initial stage of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), MHE patients have associated with widespread neuro-psychological impairment. Liver transplantation (LT) can restore metabolic abnormalities but the mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to longitudinally evaluate brain function alteration in MHE patients one month after LT and their correlation with cognitive changes by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Rs-fMRI data was collected from 32 healthy controls and 27 MHE before and 1 month after LT. Between-group comparisons of demographic data and neuropsychological scores were analyzed using SPSS 25.0. Functional imaging data were analyzed using RESTplus and SPM12 software based on MATLAB 2017b. Gender, age, and years of education were used as covariates to obtain low-frequency fluctuationd (ALFF) and dynamic low-frequency fluctuation (dALFF) dindices. Correlation analyses were performed to explore the relationship between the change of ALFF and dALFF with the change of clinical indexes pre- and post-LT. Compared to controls, ALFF values increased in the Left Cerebelum 8, right orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (ORBinf), right superior occipital gyrus (SOG) and decreased in right PreCG and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in patients post-LT; dALFF values increased in the right temporal pole and middle temporal gyrus (TPOmid), right ORBinf, left caudate nucleus (CAU), right SOG and decreased in left PreCG, left PCUN, left ANG, left SMA and left MFG in patients post-LT. Compared to pre-LT, ALFF values of post-LT patients increased in the right calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex (CAL), right MOG and decreased in right cerebelum 8, left PCUN; dALFF values of post-LT patients decreased in right thalamus (THA), left posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and left MFG. The changes of ALFF in the left PCUN, right CAL and right MOG were correlated with change of digit symbol test (DST) scores (P < 0.05). In summary, this study not only showcases the potential of ALFF/dALFF algorithms for assessing alterations in spontaneous neural activity in MHE, but also provides new insights into the altered brain functions in MHE patients 1 month after LT, which may facilitate the elucidation of elucidation of mechanisms underlying cognitive restoration post-LT in MHE patients.",

    "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

    "title": "Thyroid nodule and lymph node metastasis assessment from ultrasound images using deep learning",
    "content": "ObjectivesThe preoperative differentiation of thyroid nodules into benign thyroid nodules (BTN), non-metastatic malignant thyroid nodules (NMTN), and metastatic malignant thyroid nodules (MMTN) is critical for guiding clinical management strategies. Ultrasound (US) examinations frequently exhibit diagnostic inconsistencies due to operator-dependent variability. Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD), an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can help overcome inconsistencies in US examination outcomes by leveraging large-scale ultrasound imaging datasets to improve classification accuracy. Our study aimed to establish and validate this AI-powered ultrasound diagnostic model for precise preoperative discrimination among BTN, NMTN, and MMTN.MethodsA total of 209 patients (BTN\u2009=\u200966, NMTN\u2009=\u200915, and MMTN\u2009=\u2009128) were consecutively identified and enrolled from a multi-center database. A subset of 195 patients (BTN\u2009=\u200960, NMTN\u2009=\u200915, and MMTN\u2009=\u2009120) was selected for final analysis. These patients were divided into two groups: a training set (BTN\u2009=\u200950, NMTN\u2009=\u200911, and MMTN\u2009=\u2009100) and a testing set (BTN\u2009=\u200910, NMTN\u2009=\u20094, and MMTN\u2009=\u200920). A total of 3,537 ultrasound images from the 195 patients were preprocessed by normalizing grayscale values and reducing noise. The processed images were then input into the AI model, which was trained to classify thyroid nodules. The model\u2019s performance was evaluated using the testing set and assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the confusion matrix. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy of the AI model was compared with that of radiologists to determine its clinical utility in ultrasound-based diagnosis.ResultsCompared to junior and senior radiologists, the AI model achieved near-perfect AUC values of 0.97 (BTN), 0.99 (NMTN), and 0.96 (MMTN), significantly outperforming the senior radiologist\u2019s AUCs (0.88 for NMTN) and the junior radiologist\u2019s weaker discrimination. In addition, the accuracy of this model was higher than all ultrasound radiologists (95% vs. 73 and 84% for the junior radiologist and senior radiologist, respectively).ConclusionThe AI-based ultrasound imaging diagnostic model showed excellent performance in differentiating BTN, NMTN, and MMTN, supporting its value as a diagnostic tool for the clinical decision-making process.",

    "title": "The multi-pathway treatment of flavonoids as natural compounds in neurological diseases: achievements, limitations, and prospects",
    "content": "BackgroundThe nervous system governs fundamental life activities and higher neural functions, maintaining the body\u2019s interaction with the external environment and internal homeostasis. Neurological diseases are a common and complex group of disorders that severely impair patients\u2019 quality of life and physical health. Flavonoids, as a class of active components widely present in natural plants, play a crucial role in the research on neurological diseases.ObjectiveThe purpose of this review is to systematically sum up the action mechanisms, research advancements, and existing clinical uses of flavonoids in preventing and treating neurological diseases, probing into their potential in the management of neurological diseases.MethodsBy searching databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Wiley, Springer, NPG, ACS, Elsevier, and RSC, literature published between 2000 and 2025 concerning the treatment of neurological diseases with flavonoids was collected from both domestic and international sources. Priority should be given to flavonoids that have been confirmed by existing studies to be directly related to the pathogenesis or intervention effect of neurological diseases, with high quality and no contradictory results, clear chemical structures and definite metabolic pathways in vivo. Flavonoids that have no clear neurological association, have only been reported once and lack repeated verification or have a low level of evidence, and whose structures have not been resolved or whose metabolic processes are ambiguous should be excluded. After excluding studies with duplicate components and mechanisms, as well as outdated ones, a total of 190 core studies were finally screened and included from more than 15,000 literatures. These were systematically organized, categorized, and analysed across five dimensions: types of flavonoids, disease categories, experimental models, regulatory effects, and key targets.ResultsFlavonoids can exert neuroprotective effects in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases through multiple pathways, such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, and neurotransmitter regulation.ConclusionFlavonoids exhibit clear pharmacological effects and favorable safety profiles in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases, laying a foundation for the research and development of new drugs.",

    "content": "The proliferation of deepfake technologies presents serious challenges for forensic speech authentication. We propose a deep learning framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve detection of manipulated audio. Leveraging the spectral feature extraction of CNNs and the temporal modeling of LSTMs, the model demonstrates superior accuracy and generalization across the ASVspoof2019 LA and WaveFake datasets. Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCCs) were employed as acoustic features and outperformed MFCC and GFCC representations. To enhance transparency and trustworthiness, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including Grad-CAM and SHAP, were applied, revealing that the model focuses on high-frequency artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These interpretable analyses validate both the models design and the forensic relevance of LFCC features. The proposed approach thus provides a robust, interpretable, and XAI-driven solution for forensic authentic detection.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "content": "<p>How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration in freely moving male and female humans. Participants navigated predefined routes, indicated the start position to quantify accumulated errors, and once per route corrected their estimate using a visual landmark. Our findings reveal that homing error accumulated along the course of navigation, but a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated errors. However, this effect was transient and less pronounced when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors can hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. Theta activity in the retrosplenial complex supported the realignment of internal spatial representations by anchoring self-motion-derived estimates to visual landmark cues. Increased theta power and phase resetting upon landmark presentation accompanied subtle corrections, supporting a smooth realignment of spatial representations, whereas diminished synchronization marked the need for more extensive spatial updating. In addition, we identified motor-related theta response that scaled with rotational acceleration. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual role of theta oscillations in flexibly integrating multimodal signals, supporting both the recalibration of spatial representations to external cues and the encoding of self-motion information during naturalistic human navigation<i>.</i></p>",

    "content": "<p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by motor coordination and cognitive deficits. In AS, hippocampal neurons show reduced filamentous (F-)actin, a decrease we also reported in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, along with impaired mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Currently, there are no pharmacological targets to prevent the decrease of F-actin in AS. Here, we utilize a first-in-class selective cofilin inhibitor (SZ-3) to restore PIEZO2 function in DRG neurons and glutamate-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons from AS mice. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that inhibiting cofilin, an actin-severing protein, with SZ-3 increases cellular stiffness by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, systemic administration of SZ-3 in male and female AS mice enhances their performance in the rotarod and T-maze tests. These findings support that cytoskeletal dysregulation contributes to impaired ion channel function and behavioral deficits and that actin-binding proteins could serve as a target for enhancing motor coordination and spatial learning in AS.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Epileptic seizures involve a cortical excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance driven by dysfunctional interneurons that contribute to gamma oscillation generation. While impaired gamma oscillations are commonly reported in epilepsy, the dynamics of broadband and narrowband gamma as well as beta oscillations remain underexplored. These oscillations may serve as noninvasive electrophysiological markers associated with altered cortical dynamics, potentially reflecting underlying excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy. Here, we recorded high-density electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data to investigate visual stimuli-elicited cortical oscillations in 48 neurotypical (20 females) and 49 children (26 females) with epilepsy. We found that epilepsy is characterized by reduced amplitude and prolonged latency of evoked cortical response compared with controls after visual stimulation, with alterations in N1 peaks and M100, M150, and M250 components (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, source imaging revealed disrupted oscillatory features in epilepsy patients, including suppressed power, reduced amplitude, and increased latency in evoked and induced beta and gamma oscillations from the visual cortex (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). These alterations were consistent across diverse epilepsy subtypes, including focal, generalized, and nonlesional epilepsy cases. Utilizing these differences, we developed a novel classification model that differentiates individuals with epilepsy from controls with high accuracy, offering potential clinical utility in epilepsy diagnosis. Our results suggest disrupted beta and gamma oscillations may be associated with impaired inhibitory mechanisms and altered cortical dynamics, potentially indicative of an excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance. Our findings highlight the potential of noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers to capture cortical dynamics possibly influenced by excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy, supporting their use in early diagnosis and disease monitoring.</p>",

    "title": "Walking Modulates Active Auditory Sensing",
    "content": "<p>Walking provides the motor foundation for navigation, while navigation ensures that walking is purposeful and adaptive to environmental contexts. Sensory processing of environmental information acts as the informational bridge that connects walking and adaptive navigation. In the current study, we assessed if walking and the walking direction influences neuronal dynamics underlying environmental information processing. To this end, we conducted two experiments with 12 male and 18 female participants while they walked along an 8-shaped path. Auditory entrainment stimuli were continuously presented, and mobile electroencephalogram was recorded. We found increased auditory entrainment (auditory steady-state response) and early auditory evoked responses during walking compared with standing or stepping in place. We also replicated the well-established reduction of occipital alpha power during walking. The increase of auditory entrainment and the decrease of alpha power were correlated across participants. In the second experiment, randomly presented transient burst sounds led to a perturbation of the auditory entrainment response. The perturbation response was stronger during walking compared with standing; however, only when the burst sounds were presented to one ear but not to both ears. Most importantly, we found that the auditory entrainment was systematically modulated dependent on the walking path. The entrainment responses changed as a function of the turning direction. In general, the current work shows that walking changes auditory processing in a walking path-dependent way which might serve to optimize navigation. The walking path-related modulation might further reflect a shift of attention, marking a form of higher-order active sensing.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Although TREK1 channels are widely expressed in several thalamic nuclei, the role of this K<sub>2P</sub> family member in modulating thalamic cell excitability and physiological thalamocortical oscillatory activity is not well studied. Here we explored the contribution of TREK1 channels to membrane properties of two important building blocks of the thalamocortical (TC) system, namely, GABAergic neurons of reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) and TC neurons in different sensory thalamic nuclei including the ventrobasal complex (VB; somatosensory system) and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN; auditory system), using male TREK1 knock-out (TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice. Furthermore, we show that the loss of TREK1 channels has distinct effects on neuronal function in different thalamic nuclei. Compared with controls, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit decreased excitability in RTN neurons, while VB neurons maintain similar excitability levels. Additionally, the absence of TREK1 channels alters the action potential (AP) characteristics in VB TC neurons and affects GABAergic inhibitory tone in RTN neurons. In TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, the excitability of cortical pyramidal cells is increased. It is tempting to assume that this combination of changes contributes to a high number of sharp, spindle-like oscillations observed in sleep local field potential (LFP) recordings of these mice. In addition, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice show a lower amount of delta (1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) oscillations during slow-wave sleep and a time-of-day-dependent alteration in the amount of sleep and wakefulness. They also show disturbed auditory signal processing and altered excitability in the auditory thalamus. These findings underline the relevance of TREK1 channels&rsquo; broad contribution to the thalamus and thalamocortical system.</p>",

    "title": "Common Mechanism Underlying Synaptic Dysfunction Caused by Preformed Fibril-Induced Accumulation of {alpha}-Synuclein or Tau in a Culture Propagation Model",
    "content": "<p>In sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, the endogenous proteins &alpha;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and tau in Alzheimer's disease undergo pathogenic prion-like propagation over many years, accumulating in both soluble and insoluble forms in neurons including synapses, where they impair synaptic transmission and potentially cause various neuronal symptoms. To investigate the functional outcome of such synaptic accumulation, we induced accumulation of endogenous proteins in murine and human synapses by incubating mouse (of either sex) neuronal cultures with pathogenic preformed fibrils (pffs). Two weeks after treatment with human &alpha;-synuclein or tau pff, the respective endogenous proteins accumulated in neurons including presynaptic terminals, where we also observed tubulin accumulation, suggesting microtubule over-assembly. These were not associated with mRNA upregulation and were prevented by pharmacological stimulation of autophagy. Both pffs caused accumulation of p62 in cell bodies, suggesting compromised protein degradation. pHluorin imaging in synapses indicated a marked prolongation of vesicular endocytic time, which was rescued by pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules or by the overexpression of full-length dynamin 1. Since dynamin is a high-affinity binding partner of microtubules as well as an endocytic key molecule, over-assembled microtubules can sequester dynamin, thereby inhibiting endocytosis. We conclude that pff-induced accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein or tau in presynaptic terminals can disrupt vesicle endocytosis through a common mechanism. Since endocytosis-dependent vesicle recycling is critical for maintaining neurotransmitter release, its disruption can affect the neurocircuitry operations involved, thereby causing diverse symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, our data suggest a common molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunctions associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.</p>",

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is central to cognition, motivation, reward, and emotion, and the hippocampus is critically involved in reward memory. The mPFC possesses an enormous variety of projection neurons. However, the direct projection from the mPFC to the hippocampus involved in METH addiction has not been studied well. To explore the role of a mPFC-hippocampus pathway of regulating METH reward memory, conditioned place preference (CPP) was used to detect reward memory and recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/9s (rAAV2/9s) were used to label neurons, identify projections, and optogenetically explore involvement of the male mice mPFC-hippocampus pathway in regulating METH-CPP. We found that a novel prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL) projection directly to the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) regulated CPP induced by METH. Moreover, optogenetic activation or inhibition and silencing the PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway with tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) modulated METH-CPP. Our results reveal a PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway that regulates METH-CPP and could serve as a potential target for treating METH use disorder.</p>",

Representing and manipulating logical algorithms, such as \"for\" loops and \"if\" conditionals, is key to programming. Are representations of these algorithms acquired when people learn to program? Alternatively, do they predate instruction and get \"recycled\"? College students (<i>n</i> = 22, 11 females and 11 males) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study before and after their first programming course (Python) and completed a battery of behavioral tasks. After a one-semester Python course, reading Python functions (relative to working memory control) activated an independently localized left-lateralized frontoparietal reasoning network. This same network was already engaged by pseudocode, plain English descriptions of Python, even before the course. Critically, multivariate population codes in this frontoparietal network distinguished \"for\" loops and \"if\" conditional algorithms, both before and after. Representational similarity analysis revealed shared information in the frontoparietal network before and after instruction.

    "title": "Reduction in Reward-Driven Behavior Depends on the Basolateral But Not Central Nucleus of the Amygdala in Female Rats",
    "content": "<p>Adaptive behavior depends on a dynamic balance between acquisition and extinction memories. Male and female rodents differ in extinction learning rates, suggesting potential sex-based differences in this balance. In males, deletion of extinction-recruited neurons in the central nucleus (CN) of the amygdala impairs extinction retrieval, shifting behavior toward acquisition (Lay et al., 2023). Here, we tested whether this mechanism also operates in females. In contrast to previously reported findings in males, deleting extinction-recruited CN neurons after single or extended extinction training had no effect on extinction retrieval in female rats. This lack of behavioral impact was not due to sex differences in CN activation during extinction. However, during early extinction, females showed greater activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) than males. Deletion of this BLA ensemble produced a more substantial reduction in conditioned approach than in non-deletion controls. These findings uncover a potential interplay between the CN and BLA in regulating conditioned approach in females. While ablation of extinction-recruited CN neurons do not modulate extinction retrieval in females, targeted BLA neuronal ablation during early extinction shifts behavior toward low, extinction-level responding. Thus heightened BLA activation during early extinction may prevent the emergence of extinction-like behavior in females. These findings, taken together with those reported by Lay et al. (2023), offer new insights into potential sex-based differences in the neural mechanisms underlying extinction and may inform the development of sex-based treatments for cue-triggered appetitive behaviors.</p>",

    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "content": "Objective. Precise electrophysiological recordings and stimulation of deep brain structures in large animal models such as non-human primates require highly accurate targeting methods that are currently lacking. Approach. To address this limitation, we have integrated advanced multi-camera neuronavigation, high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography), and tailored surgical methods to chronically implant electrodes in deep structures of the macaque brain, with an accuracy below or at the millimeter scale. Main results. We first illustrate the advantage of multi-camera neuronavigation over traditional two-camera systems in 3D-printed head models, demonstrating that a submillimeter accuracy requires at least five cameras. We then introduce a detailed experimental protocol using skull-based registration for reaching submillimeter accuracies in vivo. This protocol was optimized and tested in three macaque monkeys across seven implantations targeting the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex, including five performed with skull-based registration. Next, we quantify our targeting accuracy for these two structures by in vivo neuroimaging and histological analyses. We show that our skull-based registration procedure enabled to target the entorhinal cortex with submillimetric accuracy (0.55 mm and 0.89 mm in two animals), while implantation errors for the hippocampus were slightly higher (1.11 mm and 1.68 mm in two animals). Finally, we validate our approach with electrophysiological recordings of these targeted structures during drowsiness and stimulation-induced epileptiform afterdischarges in two chronically implanted animals. Significance. This technological and surgical framework provides a means to record and stimulate deep brain structures in large animal models with submillimetric to millimetric accuracy.",

    "content": "Objective. Accurate detection and classification of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have become increasingly important for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, few open-source platforms offer both state-of-the-art computational methods and user-friendly interfaces to support practical clinical use. Approach. We present PyHFO 2.0, an enhanced open-source, Python-based platform that extends previous work by incorporating a more comprehensive set of detection methods and deep learning (DL) tools for HFO analysis. The platform now supports three commonly used detectors: short-term energy, Montreal Neurological Institute, and a newly integrated Hilbert transform-based detector. For HFO classification, PyHFO 2.0 includes DL models for artifact rejection, spike HFO detection, and identification of epileptogenic HFOs. These models are integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem for automatic loading and can be replaced with custom-trained alternatives. An interactive annotation module enables clinicians and researchers to inspect, verify, and reclassify events. Main results. All detection and classification modules were evaluated using clinical EEG datasets, supporting the applicability of the platform in both research and translational settings. Validation across multiple datasets demonstrated close alignment with expert-labeled annotations and standard tools such as RIPPLELAB. Significance. PyHFO 2.0 aims to simplify the use of computational neuroscience tools in both research and clinical environments by combining methodological rigor with a user-friendly graphical interface. Its scalable architecture and model integration capabilities support a range of applications in biomarker discovery, epilepsy diagnostics, and clinical decision support, bridging advanced computation and practical usability.",

    "title": "A methodological framework for the efficient characterization of peripheral nerve stimulation parameters",
    "content": "Objective. Restoring movement and somatosensation with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) requires precise neural activation. Because pulse amplitude (PA) and pulse width (PW) recruit axons differently, intentionally modulating both could enable more advanced PNS. However, mapping the PA-PW space is currently prohibitively time-intensive. This paper proposes and clinically validates an efficient method to characterize multiple intensities in the PA-PW space for motor and perceptual sensory applications using minimal data collection. Approach. We used cuff electrodes implanted in one participant with a spinal cord injury to generate iso-EMG activation contours and two participants with upper limb loss to generate somatosensory perceptual iso-intensity contours in the PA-PW space. Strength-duration (SD) curves were mapped to the contours using varying sample point subsets and assessed for fit quality. Finite element modeling of a human nerve and activation simulations evaluated differences in recruited axon populations across the PA-PW space. Main results. SD curves accurately fit all levels of motor activation and perceptual intensity (median and , respectively). Reliable estimates of SD curves at any intensity require only two sufficiently-spaced points (motor , sensory ). Using this data, we present and validate a novel method for efficiently characterizing the PA-PW space using SD curves, including a metric that quantifies mapping accuracy based on two sampled points. In silico, intensity-matched high-PW and high-PA stimulation recruited overlapping, but not equivalent, axon sets, with high-PA stimuli preferentially recruiting large-diameter fibers and axons farther from the contact. Significance. This method enables rapid, accurate mapping of the stimulation parameter space for clinical motor and sensory PNS. The efficiency of the proposed characterization approach enhances the clinical feasibility of multiparameter modulation, establishing a framework for further exploration of two-parameter modulation for increased selectivity and resolution, reduced fatigue, and unique percept generation.

    "content": "Objective. High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain convolutional neural networks that fail to capture cross-channel time\u2013frequency cues or on heavy transformer/generative adversarial network decoders that strain memory and stability. Approach. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time\u2013Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modeling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series. Main results. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. Significance. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

In steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigms, prolonged exposure to visual stimuli can induce visual fatigue, leading to alterations in EEG patterns that degrade BCI performance. To mitigate fatigue-induced variability, this study employs visual stimulation in the beta frequency range (14-22 Hz), a range that appears less...",

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This year it became <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/08/the-state-of-python-2025/\">the most popular Python framework</a>, which comes as no surprise.</p> <p>Recently I had the chance to chat with Sebasti\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, the creator of FastAPI. We talked about why it became so popular since <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0zxa9/introducing_fastapi/\">its launch seven years ago</a>, what\u2019s next on the roadmap, FastAPI Cloud, the impact of the faster CPython initiative, and being a self-taught developer (yes, he\u2019s self-taught!). We also talked about <a href=\"https://x.com/tiangolo/status/1281946592459853830\">that famous tweet about companies asking for more years of experience with a framework than it\u2019s even existed</a>.</p> <p>Sebasti\u00e1n was super nice, kind and humble. I didn't expect someone so popular to be so down-to-earth.</p> <p>I think there are some useful takeaways here for other devs in this community, so I'm sharing the link below.

    "title": "Microbes in the Moonlight: How the Gut Microbiota Influences Sleep",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.02766v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and improve health outcomes",

    "title": "Distinct patterns of de novo coding variants contribute to Tourette Syndrome etiology",
    "content": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a highly heritable childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by persistent motor and vocal tics. While both common and rare variants contribute to TS susceptibility, the role of rare de novo mutations (DNMs) remains incompletely characterized. Here, we report findings from the largest TS whole-exome sequencing study to date, analyzing 1,466 TS trios alongside 6,714 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) trios and 5,880 unaffected sibling controls from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) and SPARK cohorts. Leveraging a trio-based design across these cohorts enabled calibrated assessment of DNM burden while controlling for background mutation rates. We observed a significant exome-wide enrichment of protein-truncating DNMs in TS probands, particularly within genes intolerant to loss-of-function variation (pLI [&ge;] 0.9), with little contribution from damaging missense variants. Notably, TS probands did not exhibit enrichment in previously implicated ASD or developmental delay (DD) genes, but elsewhere in the genome, suggesting a distinct rare variant architecture. Using a Bayesian statistical framework that integrates both de novo and rare inherited coding variants, we identified three candidate TS risk genes with FDR [&le;] 0.05: PPP5C, EXOC1, and GXYLT1. Literature shows that they have prior links to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. These findings reveal a rare variant burden in TS that is genetically distinguishable from ASD, underscore the importance of loss-of-function mutations in TS risk, and nominate novel candidate genes for future functional investigation.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems.

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Objective. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. This represents a paradigm shift in the analysis of neural data to overcome the inherent limitations of static assumptions about functional brain connectivity. By exploiting the information provided by high temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the possibility of tracking functional network organization and reconfiguration that support brain functions at different temporal scales has been extensively explored. Approach. This review examines the current state-of-the-art of the methodological approaches for dFC analysis in biomedical science, focusing on literature from 2018 to 2024 and on the analysis of EEG and MEG data. The review primarily concentrates on methods for estimating the time-resolved functional connectivity matrix, also providing an overview of approaches for summarising and inferring dynamic information. Main results. An insight into the available methodological approaches for tracking dFC at different temporal scales is offered. Besides the classical sliding window method, advances in instantaneous dFC algorithms are described and two novel approaches are introduced: microstate-based dFC (micro-dFC) and data-driven dFC methods. For each approach, specific features are detailed, and the dataset characteristics to ensure applicability are discussed. In addition, possible post-processing procedures for extracting the dynamic properties and information of interest are presented. Significance. The undoubted potential of dFC analysis for the study of brain dynamics is highlighted, providing a guide for its application, also taking into consideration the study protocol, the nature of the data and the temporal resolution of interest. Current limitations and open challenges are also critically addressed.",

    "title": "Neuromodulation for Tourette syndrome: current techniques and future perspectives",
    "content": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in TS, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. TS can have substantial effects on quality of life, social and intellectual development, opportunities, relationships, and more. Treatment options are limited; the most common being behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotics and anti-adrenergic agents, often yielding unsatisfactory benefits. Neuromodulation, the alteration of neural pathways and networks under external stimulation, has been established as a viable treatment strategy for specific aspects of TS. Several neuromodulation techniques have been utilized, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibiting the strongest efficacy at around 50% reduction of tics on average across cohorts. However, the invasive nature of DBS remains a disincentive for its uptake, as well as the natural reduction in tic severity for many TS individuals as they enter adulthood. Less-invasive neuromodulation has also been explored, but efficacy remains limited. Given its effectiveness in TS, DBS provides the unique opportunity to record neural activity from deep brain structures, which has been used to investigate underlying pathophysiology and search for biomarkers of treatment response. These insights may guide strategies for less invasive neuromodulation. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss currently utilized neuromodulation therapies for the treatment of TS, as well as propose potential future strategies. Additionally, we discuss how to maximize progress in the field, including crucial multicenter data sharing, utilization of recording capabilities on DBS devices, correlation with the precise location of implanted electrodes, and harnessing pre-clinical studies for a more parameterized understanding of TS neuromodulation. These techniques will enable a clearer understanding of TS and the mechanisms behind successful treatment. This could lead to advanced therapies that improve the quality of life for individuals with TS.",

    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress.

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

    "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

    "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
    "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

    "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

    "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",

This limited attention restricts the practical use of music\u2019s emotional, cognitive, and motor functions. The current study aimed to investigate structural differences in the brains of musicians compared to non-musicians in order to better understand the neuroanatomical basis of musical training.MethodsSixteen musicians and seventeen age-matched non-musicians underwent a brain structural neuroimaging scan. Group differences in structural morphometry were assessed.ResultsSignificant differences were found in cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth measures. Compared to non-musicians, musicians showed greater cortical thickness in the left superior frontal gyrus and right central parietal region, and showed structural advantages in fractal dimensionality and sulcal depth in the left fusiform gyrus and right central region. In contrast, non-musicians showed greater gyrification in the bilateral insula, right superior parietal lobule, and right supramarginal gyrus. Notably, significant interactive effects were observed between gender and cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth in regions of the limbic system, including the hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, insula, fusiform gyrus, and precuneus.ConclusionStructural differences in the frontal cortex, limbic system, and sensorimotor areas between musicians and non-musicians highlight the changes in brain structure associated with musical training. These findings provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of music-related brain function and may provide guidance for future applications of music to improve mental health and neuroplasticity.",

    "content": "Interpersonal neural synchrony provides a neural index of how individuals align cognitively and socially during interaction. While previous work has shown that personality traits shape interpersonal behavior, and that trait similarity can enhance dyadic coordination, little is known about whether such similarity predicts neural synchrony. The present study used an electroencephalography (EEG) hyper-scanning methodology to investigate the relationship between the degree of similarity in Big 5 scores of interacting participants in dyads and their interbrain synchrony during naturalistic dialogue. A total of 23 female dyads completed the Big 5 questionnaire and performed a goal-oriented social task while each wearing lightweight EEG headsets. Similarity for each Big 5 personality scale was created by calculating the absolute difference between the two participants within each dyad. Interpersonal neural synchrony was measured using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which quantified the similarity between separate temporal signals, based on a time-frequency decomposition of EEG. Results showed that similarity of Conscientiousness scores within dyads significantly predicted interpersonal neural synchrony within dyads (with openness showing marginal prediction). No relationship was evident for any other Big 5 trait. These findings demonstrate that personality similarity, particularly in conscientiousness, contributes to interpersonal neural synchrony, highlighting a trait-based pathway through which social alignment emerges during naturalistic interaction.",

    "title": "DeepAttNet: deep neural network incorporating cross-attention mechanism for subject-independent mental stress detection in passive brain\u2013computer interfaces using bilateral ear-EEG",
    "content": "IntroductionElectroencephalography (EEG)-based mental stress detection has the potential to be applied in diverse real-world scenarios, including workplace safety, mental health monitoring, and human\u2013computer interaction. However, most previous passive brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) studies have employed EEG recorded during the performance of specific tasks, making the classification results susceptible to task engagement effects rather than reflecting stress alone. To address this limitation, we introduce a rest-versus-rest paradigm that compares resting EEG recorded immediately after exposure to a stressor with that recorded after meditation, thereby isolating mental stress from the task-related confounds. EEG recording setups were designed under the assumption of bilateral ear-EEG, a compact and discreet form factor suitable for real-world applications. Furthermore, we developed a novel subject-independent deep learning classifier tailored to model interhemispheric neural dynamics for enhanced mental stress detection performance.MethodsThirty-two adults participated in the experiment. To classify mental stress status in a subject-independent manner, we proposed DeepAttNet, a deep learning model based on cross-attention and pointwise temporal compression, specifically designed to effectively capture left and right hemispherical interactions. Classification performance was assessed using eight-fold subject-level cross-validation against conventional deep learning models, including EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, DeepConvNet, and TSception. Ablation studies evaluated the impact of the cross-attention and/or pointwise compression modules.ResultsDeepAttNet achieved the highest average accuracy and macro-F1 values, with performance declining when either the cross-attention or pointwise compression module was removed in the ablation studies. Explainability analyses indicated lower cross-attention entropy with stronger directional ear-to-ear asymmetry under stress, and temporal occlusion identified mid\u2013late windows supporting stress decisions. Moreover, six of seven canonical scalp-EEG markers were FDR-significant for post-stressor vs. post-relaxation rest.ConclusionThe proposed rest-versus-rest paradigm and DeepAttNet enabled robust, subject-independent mental stress detection with a fairly high accuracy using only two-channel EEG recordings. This approach is expected to offer a practical solution for continuous stress monitoring, potentially advancing passive BCI applications outside laboratory settings.",

    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

    "content": "IntroductionImplantable neural devices, including brain\u2013computer interfaces and spinal cord stimulators, hold significant therapeutic promise for conditions such as paralysis and chronic pain. However, the novelty of these technologies introduces unique ethical challenges. While much of the existing literature emphasizes development-related concerns such as device safety, the ethical issues surrounding explantation remain relatively underexplored.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review to identify ethical, legal, and sociocultural considerations relevant to the explantation of neural devices. The review applied the IEEE BRAIN Neuroethics framework as a guiding structure for the categorization of the themes. A subsequent thematic analysis was performed to categorize and synthesize findings across studies.ResultsThematic analysis revealed that medical motives were the predominant factor in discussions of explantation, with 83% of studies citing medical complications as a central concern. Additional themes identified included changes in cognition and behavior, emotional well-being, lack of therapeutic benefit, identity, financial issues, autonomy, post-trial considerations, and neurorights.DiscussionOur findings underscore the multifaceted nature of neural device explantation, extending beyond purely medical considerations to include psychological, financial, legal, and sociocultural dimensions. These results highlight the necessity of interdisciplinary approaches to adequately address the broad spectrum of challenges associated with explantation.",

    "title": "A clinical case report on transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound neuromodulation for central post-stroke pain",
    "content": "Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) manifests as persistent or intermittent pain following cerebral infarction or hemorrhage and is described as \u201cone of the most agonizing, disabling, and refractory pain syndromes.\u201d Its treatment represents a significant clinical challenge. In this case, we used transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (tLIFU), an emerging non-invasive neuromodulation approach distinct from pharmacological and traditional neuromodulation methods, to treat CPSP patients, achieving satisfactory outcomes. This approach may inspire new perspectives on innovative pain management. A 66-year-old male veteran suffered long-term CPSP, with unsatisfactory pain relief from previous paregoric interventions, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) revealed abnormal activity in a region of interest (ROI) that responded to analgesic medication adjustments. This ROI was anatomically consistent with the cingulum bundle. Given this finding, we used tLIFU to demonstrate deep stimulation of the ROI. Remarkable pain reduction was observed after 1\u202fweek of tLIFU neuromodulation, allowing for a slight tapering of the gabapentin dose. The analgesic effects of tLIFU were sustained throughout a 5-month follow-up period, with no adverse events reported. Since day 120, the patient has remained off analgesic medications, and at the 150-day follow-up, BOLD-fMRI revealed a normalized activity pattern in the region of interest (ROI). Additionally, significant clinical improvement was noted in the patient\u2019s emotional state. This case report highlights the potential of tLIFU technology to expand therapeutic options in clinical pain management. Exploratory research into the clinical efficacy and the underlying mechanisms of tLIFU in pain treatment may contribute to a deeper understanding of pain pathogenesis and support the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
    "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

Recently, these arrays have also been applied to deliver electrical stimulation aimed at restoring sensory functions. A key challenge limiting their longevity is the micromotion between the array and cortical tissue, which may induce mechanical strain in surrounding tissue...",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Type S and M errors as a \u201crhetorical tool\u201d",
    "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One very obvious way to see that I never thought Type M and Type S errors \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis'\" is that, since the appearance of that article in 2014, I've published dozens of applied papers, and in only very few of these did I look at Type M and Type S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

To date, the performance of the trim and fill\nmethod has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more\ncomprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in\na number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those\nfrom usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely\nuse of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in\nthe meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the\nperformance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study\nheterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive\neffect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is\npresent the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than\nthe usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate\nfrom the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the\npresence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our\nsimulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the\npresence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce\nthe bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not\nideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly\ncaused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the\nperformance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various\nmeta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form\nof sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.2889&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n17476644&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;4544-4562&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Performance\nof the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and\nbetween-study\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Peters&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jaime\nL.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Sutton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Alex\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;David\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Abrams&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Keith\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Rushton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lesley&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2007&quot;,11,10]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/DMQP989N&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;It\nis known that the existence of publication bias can influence the conclusions\nof a meta-analysis. Some methods have been developed to deal with publication\nbias, but issues remain. One particular method called 'trim and fill' is\ndesigned to adjust for publication bias. The method, which is intuitively\nappealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a simple and\npopular graphical tool called the funnel plot. We present a simulation study\ndesigned to evaluate the behaviour of this method. Our results indicate that\nwhen the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they estimate different\neffects), trim and fill may inappropriately adjust for publication bias where\nnone exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously adjust for non-existent\nbias if (i) the variability among studies causes some precisely estimated\nstudies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii) an inverse\nrelationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is introduced by the\nstudies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest that the funnel plot\nitself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses. Selection modelling is\nan alternative method warranting further study. It performed better than trim\nand fill in our simulations, although its frequency of convergence varied,\ndepending on the simulation parameters.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.1461&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n12820277&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;2113-2126&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Adjusting\nfor publication bias in the presence of\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Terrin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Norma&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schmid&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Christopher\nH.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lau&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joseph&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Olkin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ingram&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2003&quot;,7,15]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Peters\net al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

Specifying a\nrange of values around zero allows researchers to statistically reject the\npresence of effects large enough to matter, and prevents practically\ninsignificant effects from being interpreted as a statistically significant\ndifference. We compare the behavior of the recently proposed second generation\np-value (Blume, D\u2019Agostino McGowan, Dupont, &amp; Greevy, 2018) with the more\nestablished Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) equivalence testing procedure\n(Schuirmann, 1987). We show that the two approaches yield almost identical\nresults under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g., when the\nconfidence interval is wider than the equivalence range, or when confidence\nintervals are asymmetric) the second generation p-value becomes difficult to\ninterpret. The second generation p-value is interpretable in a dichotomous\nmanner (i.e., when the SGPV equals 0 or 1 because the confidence intervals lies\ncompletely within or outside of the equivalence range), but this dichotomous\ninterpretation does not require calculations. We conclude that equivalence\ntests yield more consistent p-values, distinguish between datasets that yield\nthe same second generation p-value, and allow for easier control of Type I and\nType II error rates.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.933&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Daniel Lakens, Marie Delacre&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;1-11&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Equivalence\nTesting and the Second Generation\nP-Value&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Delacre&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marie&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,7,13]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lakens\n&amp; Delacre, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

We then\npropose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the\nreplication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The\nreplication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we\ncould gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a)\nthe value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim\nbased on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal\ndecision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph\nmodeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of\nexpected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative\nestimates of replication value.

We\ntested our strategy on a sample of fMRI studies in social neuroscience. We\nfirst report our efforts to generate a representative candidate set of\nreplication targets. We then explore the feasibility and reliability of\nestimating replication value for the targets in our set, resulting in a dataset\nof 1358 studies ranked on their value of prioritising them for replication. In\naddition, we carefully examine possible measures, test auxiliary assumptions,\nand identify boundary conditions of measuring value and uncertainty. We end our\nreport by discussing how future validation studies might be designed. Our study\ndemonstrates the importance of investigating how to implement study selection\nstrategies in practice.

Methodologists have proposed a variety\nof statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is\nnot clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here,\nwe present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of\nthe most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might\nrealistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several\nlevels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity,\nand used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature. Our\nresults clearly indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently\noutperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in\npsychology focus on sensitivity analyses\u2014that is, report on a variety of\nmethods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated\nby simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might\nchange depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the\ndependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly\nrecommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the\nprimary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications.

We give exact theoretical results showing\nhow selection for significance affects the distribution of statistical power in\na heterogeneous population of significance tests. In a set of large-scale\nsimulation studies, we compare four methods for estimating population mean\npower of a set of studies selected for significance (a maximum likelihood\nmodel, extensions of p-curve and p-uniform, &amp;amp; z-curve). The p-uniform\nand p-curve methods performed well with a fixed effects size and varying sample\nsizes. However, when there was substantial variability in effect sizes as well\nas sample sizes, both methods systematically overestimate mean power. With\nheterogeneity in effect sizes, the maximum likelihood model produced the most\naccurate estimates when the distribution of effect sizes matched the\nassumptions of the model, but z-curve produced more accurate estimates when the\nassumptions of the maximum likelihood model were not met. We recommend the use\nof z-curve to estimate the typical power of significant results, which has\nimplications for the replicability of significant results in psychology\njournals.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.874&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Jerry Brunner, Ulrich\nSchimmack&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Estimating\nPopulation Mean Power Under Conditions of Heterogeneity and Selection for\nSignificance&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/874&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Brunner&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jerry&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schimmack&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ulrich&quot;}],&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2022&quot;,3,16]]},&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,5,31]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Brunner\n&amp; Schimmack, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">It seems a\nbit of a stretch to say the p-curve method did not get scrutiny appropriate to\nits popularity when there were many papers that criticized it, relatively\nquickly </span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:\nEN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span>ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION\n{&quot;citationID&quot;:&quot;LqMzfpTk&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;formattedCitation&quot;:&quot;(Aert\net al., 2016; Bishop &amp; Thompson, 2016; Ulrich &amp; Miller, 2018)&quot;,&quot;plainCitation&quot;:&quot;(Aert\net al., 2016; Bishop &amp; Thompson, 2016; Ulrich &amp; Miller,\n2018)&quot;,&quot;noteIndex&quot;:0},&quot;citationItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1415,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/B8XNF95F&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:1415,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Because\nof overwhelming evidence of publication bias in psychology, techniques to\ncorrect meta-analytic estimates for such bias are greatly needed.

The properties of\np-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of\nthese simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be\nused as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a\ncertain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually\ndemonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous\nmathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined\nwithout simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any\nstatistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough\nevaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions\np-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition,\nwe used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of\npublication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence\nthe shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than\n1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also\nsuggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an\narticle as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level.\nThis gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of\nreal effects even when no such effects are actually present.

What is fair to say is that\nstatisticians failed to engage with an incredibly important topic (test for\npublication bias) that addressed a clear need in many scientific communities,\nas most of the criticism was by psychological methodologists. I fully agree\nthat statisticians should have engaged more with this technique. I believe the\nreason that they didn\u2019t is because there is a real problem in the reward\nstructure in statistics, where statisticians get greater rewards inside their\nfield by proposing a 12<sup>th</sup> approach to compute confidence intervals\naround a non-parametric effect size estimate for a test that no one uses, than\nto help psychologists solve a problem they really need a solution for. Indeed,\nfor a statistician, publication bias is a very messy business, and there will\nnever be a sufficiently rigorous test for publication bias to get credit from\nfellow statisticians. There are no beautiful mathematical solutions, no\ncreative insights, there is only the messy reality of a literature that is\nbiased by human actions that we can never adequately capture in a model. The\nfact that empirical researchers often don\u2019t know where to begin to evaluate the\nreliability of claims in their publication-bias-ridden field is not something\nstatisticians care about. But they should care about it. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I hope\nstatisticians will start to scrutinize things appropriate to their popularity.\nIf a statistical technique is cited 500 times, 3 statisticians need to drop\nwhatever they are doing, and scrutinize the hell out of this technique.

Scrutiny is important, but we can\u2019t know how extensively methods\nshould be vetted, we don\u2019t know how to identify experts, everyone \u2013 including \u2018experts\u2019\n\u2013 is fallible. It is na\u00efve to think \u2018expert vetting\u2019 will lead to clear answers\nabout the methods we should use, and should not use. If we can\u2019t even reach\nagreement about the use of p-values, no one should believe we will ever reach\nagreement about the use of methods to detect publication bias, which will\nalways be messy at best. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I like my\nscience free from authority arguments. Everyone should do their best to\ncriticize everyone else, and if they are able, themselves. Some people will be\nin a better position to criticize some papers than others, but it is difficult\nto predict where the most fatal criticism will come from. Treating statistics\npapers published in a statistics journal as superior to papers in a psychology\njournal is too messy to be a good idea, and boil down to a form of elitism that\nI can\u2019t condone.

Morey and Davis-Stober point out the limitations of simulation-based\ntests of a method and convincingly argue for the value of evaluating the\nmathematical properties of a testing procedure. If as a field we agree that an\nevaluation of the mathematical properties of a test is desirable, we should\ntrack whether this evaluation has been performed, or not. We could have a long\nchecklist of desirable quality control standards \u2013 e.g., a method has been\ntested on real datasets, it has been compared to similar methods, those\ncomparisons have been performed objectively based on a well-justified set of\ncriteria, etc. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One could\ncreate a database where for each method the quality standards that have been\nmet and that have not been met are listed. If considered useful, the database\ncould also track how often a method is used, by tracking citations, and listing\npapers that have implemented the method (as opposed to those merely discussing\nthe method). When statistical methods become widely used, the database would point\nresearchers to which methods deserve more scrutiny. The case of magnitude-based\ninference in sport science reveals the importance of a public call for scrutiny\nwhen a method becomes widely popular, especially when this popularity is\nlimited to a single field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The more\ncomplex methods are, the more limitations they have. This will be true for all\nmethods that aim to deal with publication bias, because the way scientists bias\nthe literature is difficult to quantify. Maybe as a field we will come to agree\nthat tests for bias are never accurate enough, and we will recommend people to\njust look at the distribution of p-values without performing a test. Alternatively,\nwe might believe that it is useful to have a testing procedure that too often\nsuggests a literature contains at least some non-zero effects, because we feel\nwe need some way to intersubjectively point out that there is bias in a\nliterature, even if this is based on an imperfect test. Such discussions\nrequire a wide range of stakeholders, and the opinion of statisticians about\nthe statistical properties of a test is only one source of input in this\ndiscussion. Imperfect procedures are implemented all the time, if they are the\nbest we have, and doing nothing is also not working. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Statistical\nmethods are rarely perfect from their inception, and all have limitations.

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

    "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
    "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

This study explored how acute stress impacts athletes\u2019 unfairness - related decision - making and its neural basis.MethodsForty participants (20 university athletes and 20 non-athletes) were randomly assigned to a stress group or a control group. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the study monitored the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) blood oxygenation during an ultimatum game task after inducing acute stress via the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST).ResultsAthletes under stress were more accepting of relatively unfair decisions than non-athletes. This was linked to lower activation in the frontal-eye areas (CH15), supramarginal gyrus (CH38), and somatosensory association cortex (CH67), and higher activation in the primary motor cortex (CH64) in athletes. The increase in acceptance efficiency correlated significantly with the reduced CH38 activation (r = \u22120.425) and increased CH64 activation (r = 0.499).ConclusionLong-term exercise training may promote athletes\u2019 tendency to accept relatively unfair decisions under acute stress by modulating activation levels in the supramarginal gyrus and primary motor cortex, demonstrating stronger adaptive behavior. These findings offer insights for developing stress management and neuromodulation training programs for athletes.",

    "content": "BackgroundSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular event that leads to high mortality and long-term disability, particularly among adults aged 25\u201349 years. Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the leading modifiable risk factor, yet its global burden in this age group has not been systematically assessed.MethodsWe analyzed population-level epidemiological data across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021 to estimate SAH mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to high SBP. Temporal trends were evaluated using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), and future trajectories to 2050 were projected with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.ResultsGlobally, SAH caused 24,908 deaths and 1,373,366 DALYs in 2021 due to high SBP in adults aged 25\u201349 years. Males had higher rates than females (mortality: 0.78 vs. 0.48 per 100,000; DALYs: 42.4 vs. 27.0 per 100,000), though females experienced steeper declines (EAPC_mortality: \u22121.78%). The highest burden was in the 45\u201349 age group (deaths: 9,768; DALYs: 474,092). From 1990 to 2021, high-SDI regions achieved the greatest reductions in mortality (\u221250.3%) and DALYs (\u221246.8%), while low-SDI regions saw increases in deaths (+109.5%) and DALYs (+114.7%). Nationally, Zimbabwe and Guatemala showed the sharpest increases in mortality (EAPC: +4.71% and +3.76%), while Sweden and Swiss Confederation achieved the greatest declines (EAPC: \u22125.5% and \u22124.9%). Forecasts suggest continued global declines by 2050, but widening disparities by sex, age, and socio-demographic status.ConclusionAlthough the global burden of SAH attributable to high SBP is decreasing, young and middle-aged adults-especially males and those in low-SDI regions-continue to face substantial risks. Targeted hypertension control and region-specific prevention strategies are urgently needed.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

    "title": "TDE-3: an improved prior for optical flow computation in spiking neural networks",
    "content": "Motion detection is a primary task required for robotic systems to perceive and navigate in their environment. Proposed in the literature bioinspired neuromorphic Time-Difference Encoder (TDE-2) combines event-based sensors and processors with spiking neural networks to provide real-time and energy-efficient motion detection through extracting temporal correlations between two points in space. However, on the algorithmic level, this design leads to a loss of direction-selectivity of individual TDEs in textured environments. In the present work, we propose an augmented 3-point TDE (TDE-3) with additional inhibitory input that makes TDE-3 direction-selectivity robust in textured environments. We developed a procedure to train the new TDE-3 using backpropagation through time and surrogate gradients to linearly map input velocities into an output spike count or an Inter-Spike Interval (ISI). Using synthetic data, we compared training and inference with spike count and ISI with respect to changes in stimuli dynamic range, spatial frequency, and level of noise. ISI turns out to be more robust toward variation in spatial frequency, whereas the spike count is a more reliable training signal in the presence of noise. We conducted an in-depth quantitative investigation of optical flow coding with TDE and compared TDE-2 vs. TDE-3 in terms of energy efficiency and coding precision. The results show that at the network level, both detectors show similar precision (20\u00b0 angular error, 88% correlation with the truth of the ground). However, due to the more robust direction selectivity of individual TDEs, the TDE-3 based network spikes less and is hence more energy efficient. Reported precision is on par with model-based methods but the spike-based processing of the TDEs provides allows more energy-efficient inference with neuromorphic hardware. Additionally, we also employed TDE-2 and TDE-3 to estimate ego-motion and showed results competitive with those achieved by neural networks with 1.5 \u00d7 105 parameters.",

    "content": "BackgroundTic disorder (TD) involves dysregulation of neurotransmitters. Although aripiprazole (ARI) is a first-line therapy, its mechanism remains debated, and animal studies are limited. This study investigates ARI's effects on neurotransmitter levels in a rat TD model.MethodsForty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups of eight animals each: control group, TD untreated group, and low/medium/high dose ARI groups (1.6/4/10 mg/kg). With the exception of the control group, all rats underwent modeling with 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) for seven consecutive days.Following modeling, the ARI groups were administered different doses of ARI via gavage for 2 consecutive weeks. The control group and TD untreated group received equivalent volumes of saline. Behavioral tests were conducted upon completion of the modeling phase and again following the 2-week gavage period. Changes in neurotransmitter levels in rat plasma and striatum were detected using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed on neurotransmitters showing statistically significant differences to evaluate their diagnostic efficacy for TD.Results(1) Compared with the TD untreated group, all ARI dose groups showed lower motor and stereotypic behavior scores after the 14-day gavage period. (2) As shown by UPLC-MS/MS, the TD untreated group had significantly lower glutamate (Glu) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in plasma, yet higher levels in the striatum, when compared to the control group. (3) Following ARI intervention, a marked reduction in striatal Glu and GABA levels was observed across all dose groups, and the Glu/GABA ratio showed a dose-dependent reduction. (4) ROC analysis revealed that plasma Glu and GABA alone had moderate predictive efficacy; striatal Glu and GABA demonstrated superior predictive performance. When combined for prediction, the AUC for plasma neurotransmitters was 0.848, and for striatal neurotransmitters, it was 0.938.ConclusionARI can regulate motor and stereotypic behaviors in TD rats and effectively control tic symptoms. TD rats exhibit dysregulation of Glu and GABA levels, and ARI can modulate Glu and GABA levels, thereby improving neurotransmitter function. Furthermore, central neurotransmitter changes demonstrate superior diagnostic value over peripheral measures for TD.",

The CS-Net framework incorporates diverse surface electromyography (sEMG) features, including raw signals and FFT representations, through a multi-stream information fusion mechanism to enhance classification performance. The proposed TL strategy involves pre-training the model on specific wrist postures and fine-tuning it on the full set of hybrid gestures, leveraging the intrinsic relationships between composite gestures and their constituent movements to improve accuracy. The framework is evaluated through extensive offline experiments using a dataset of 12 hybrid gestures (combining three wrist postures and four hand movements) collected from six subjects, comparing its performance against three deep learning algorithms in sEMG recognition filed. Main results. The average experimental result for the proposed CS-Net with TL reached 90.6%. Additionally, its generalization ability is validated with the Ninapro public databases, which are DB1, DB4, and DB5. The 30 action classification accuracy of CS-Net on the Ninapro datasets was 68.7%, 61.5% and 66.3%, respectively. To demonstrate practical applicability, real-time online experiments involving object grasping tasks is conducted, achieving a success rate of 90%. Significance. The results show that CS-Net significantly improves sEMG classification accuracy, while the TL strategy further enhances performance. Moreover, the algorithm achieved a high success rate in online experiments, confirming its robustness and practical utility for real-world applications.

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

    "title": "Inducible Calling Cards: Developing Mouse Reagents for Experimentally Controlled Transposon Insertion in vivo.",
    "content": "The piggyBac transposase enables robust forward genetic screens in mice. Further, fusions of piggyBac with specific transcription factors (TFs) enables recovery of recoverable transposons (Calling Cards) for recording location of DNA binding events in vitro and in vivo. Such applications would be enhanced by engineering inducible transposases, such that timing of recording could be precisely controlled in vivo, as has been previously developed in vitro. Here, we tested two approaches for applying inducible Calling Cards (iCC) in the murine brain. We engineered knock-ins of inducible versions of two TFs: Jun, an immediate early gene that serves as a proxy for neural activity, and Sp1, a promiscuous binder of CpG unmethylated regions that indicates active promoters. We fused hyperPiggyBac transposase and a tamoxifen-inducible domain (ERT2) to these TFs and tested the system for efficacy and temporal control of insertions, both in vitro and in vivo. Jun-iCC mice developed normally with no behavioral abnormalities, showed tamoxifen-dependent recording, and captured neural activity during pharmacologically induced seizures. Jun-iCC yields relatively low numbers of insertions, likely due to the transient expression of Jun. In contrast, Sp1-iCC provided substantially higher insertion numbers, but transgenic animals exhibited developmental abnormalities, including reduced viability, anophthalmia, and reduced body weight, suggesting that ERT2 domains may sequester Sp1 and thus significantly impact development. Nonetheless, these inducible Calling Cards mouse lines enable drug-inducible integration of transposon cargo into specific loci in the living mouse.",

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",
