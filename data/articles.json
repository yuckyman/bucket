    "title": "Early reduction and impaired targeting of myelin-associated glycoprotein to myelin membranes in Huntington disease",
    "content": "Background. Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary life-threatening disease marked by progressive neuronal loss and atrophy of grey matter structures, particularly the caudate putamen. Brain imaging studies have revealed that the degradation of the white matter occurs many years prior to symptomatic onset and neuronal loss, suggesting that the decay of brain white matter is an active contributor to the disease progression. However, the mechanisms by which the HD mutation triggers white matter loss is not well understood. Methods. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy were conducted to assess white matter pathology and explore the relevant mechanisms in CAG140 knock-in mice, which express the HD protein in the same way as patients suffering from HD and thus biologically replicate HD in human. Results. Western blot analysis of proteins localized at different layers of the myelin coat revealed that the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which is localized at the innermost layer of the myelin coat and essential for maintaining the periaxonal space and the integrity of the myelin sheath, manifested as an early and progressive decline in HD mouse caudate putamen. The loss of MAG was detected at myelinated axons and in fiber bundles in HD mouse brains at an age when the abundance of myelinated axons was normal. Fluorescence immunohistochemical studies found that MAG labeling was concentrated in the soma of a subset of oligodendrocytes, which expressed breast carcinoma amplified sequence 1, a marker for new oligodendrocytes. While their abundance was normal, new oligodendrocytes in HD mouse caudate appeared to be impeded in acquiring the expression of MAG and in targeting MAG away from perinuclear punctate structures to processes, signs of impaired maturation. Compared with those in wildtype mouse brains, oligodendrocytes in HD mouse brains had a reduced abundance of small vesicles whereas an increased abundance of large punctate structures in the perinuclear region, implying defective generation of small vesicles transporting MAG from large punctate structures in the soma to processes. The MAG-containing perinuclear punctate structures were negative for proteins specifying trans-Golgi networks, early endosomes, or exosomes but had a minor portion labeled with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1, indicating that the structures where MAG accumulates in the soma are derived from the late endosomal lysosomal compartment. Conclusions. Our study suggests that the decay of the brain white matter in Huntington disease involves a deficit in trafficking of myelin-associated glycoprotein, preventing its proper delivery from the soma of oligodendrocytes to myelin-forming processes.",

    "title": "Oxidation of \u0394FOSB at Cys172 Controls Hippocampal Gene Targets and Learning",
    "content": "Imbalance of reduction/oxidation (redox) in the brain is associated with numerous diseases including Alzheimers disease (AD), substance abuse disorders, and stroke. Moreover, cognitive decline can be caused by neuronal dysfunction that precedes cell death, and this dysfunction is in part produced by altered gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which redox state controls gene expression in neurons are not well understood. DeltaFOSB is a neuronally enriched transcription factor critical for orchestrating gene expression underlying memory, mood, and motivated behaviors. It is dysregulated in many conditions including AD. We showed recently that deltaFOSB forms a redox-sensitive disulfide bond between cysteine 172 (C172) of deltaFOSB and C279 of its preferred binding partner JUND. This bond works as a redox switch to control DNA-binding, based on studies of recombinant proteins in vitro. Here, we show that this redox control of deltaFOSB function in vitro is conserved in vivo. We show that deltaFOSB C172 forms a redox-sensitive disulfide bond with JUND that regulates the stability of this AP1-transcription factor complex and its binding to DNA in cells. We also validate the formation of deltaFOSB-containing complexes held together via disulfide bonds in mouse brain in vivo. We show that exogenous oxidative stress reduces deltaFOSB binding to gene targets in mouse brain and that Fosb C172S knock-in mice, which lack a functional deltaFOSB redox switch, are insensitive to this oxidation-dependent reduction in target gene binding, demonstrating that deltaFOSB is regulated by a redox switch that modulates binding to target genes in the hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrate that FosB C172S knock-in mice are less sensitive to cognitive dysfunction induced by oxidative stress. This evidence supports deltaFOSB as an important mediator of oxidative stress-driven changes in gene expression and cognition and implicates deltaFOSB as a possible therapeutic target for diseases associated with oxidative stress in the brain, including AD.",

    "title": "Uncertainty Shapes Neural Dynamics in Motor Cortex During Reaching",
    "content": "Voluntary reaching movements are often made with incomplete information about the movement goal, which may require the brain to flexibly adjust motor plans and ongoing movements. To examine how uncertainty about a reach target influences neural preparation and execution, we recorded activity from dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortices of a rhesus macaque trained to reach to one of two potential targets. In the task, a timing cue flashed three times in succession. Potential targets were displayed at the time of the first flash and the monkey needed to initiate the movement almost simultaneously with the third flash. Colorings of potential targets indicated the probability that the target would be at one location or the other, thereby inducing varying levels of uncertainty about the final target location. On half the trials, the final target was displayed so late that the monkey had to \"guess\" the target location, based on cues provided by the potential targets. While the monkey performed this task, we recorded 165 neurons from PMd and 37 from M1. Population neural trajectories in the preparatory subspace of PMd (but not M1) were progressively less expansive with higher levels of uncertainty. Despite differences in preparatory states associated with uncertainty, the movements produced were the same. The narrower separation between states suggested a neural-based explanation for more rapid movement re-preparation with higher uncertainty. Furthermore, we found a dimension in neural state-space representing the level of uncertainty during movement preparation and execution.",

    "title": "Chronic Dietary Exposure to Methylparaben and Ethyl paraben Induces Developmental, Biochemical, and Behavioural Toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster",
    "content": "Abstract Parabens, particularly methylparaben (MP) and ethylparaben (EP), are extensively used preservatives in cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceuticals. Although considered safe at low concentrations, recent evidence questions their biological inertness under chronic exposure. This study evaluated the developmental, biochemical, and behavioural effects of continuous dietary MP and EP exposure in Drosophila melanogaster, an established in vivo model for toxicological screening. Flies were chronically exposed to MP (0.5 to 2%) or EP (0.5 to 1.5%) throughout development and adulthood. Developmental timing, lifespan, oxidative-stress markers (MDA, FRAP, total protein), and locomotor performance (negative geotaxis in adults, crawling in larvae) were quantified. Paraben exposure significantly delayed development (a 15% increase in eclosion time), reduced median lifespan (up to a 50% decrease at 2% MP), and increased oxidative damage (MDA and FRAP) in a dose-dependent manner. Protein content declined more rapidly with age, suggesting oxidative degradation or proteolysis. Both adult climbing and larval crawling performances were impaired, indicating a link between biochemical stress and neuromuscular dysfunction. MP produced stronger oxidative and behavioural effects than EP. Feeding controls confirmed that observed deficits were not due to nutritional differences. Chronic MP and EP exposure induces systemic toxicity in D. melanogaster, integrating endocrine disruption and redox imbalance as plausible mechanisms of action. Given conserved stress and hormonal pathways, these findings reinforce the need to re-evaluate low dose paraben safety limits and highlight Drosophila as a rapid, ethically viable platform for screening environmental preservatives and safer substitutes.",

    "title": "Detection of probable neuronal gene expression changes in skin biopsies from patients with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy",
    "content": "Our inability to obtain nerve samples from the vast majority of neuropathic pain patients impedes our ability to understand the disease, creates challenges in understanding mechanisms in specific patient populations, and limits our ability to make treatment decisions based on quantifiable molecular data. Fields like oncology have overcome these problems to take advantage of the insight that sequencing offers for understanding mechanisms of disease and have leveraged these molecular insights to dramatically change the treatment landscape in the past decade. Here we tested the hypothesis that skin biopsies could be used to gain insight into neuronal transcriptomic changes in patients with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). Our analysis reveals that hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found through bulk RNA sequencing in these skin biopsies are likely contributed by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal axons and/or terminals. Up-regulated genes were representative of broad class of nociceptors whereas down-regulated genes were associated with putative injured DRG neurons expressing the PDIA2 gene. DEGs that could be confidently associated with specific subsets of skin cells were mostly expressed by keratinocytes supporting a growing literature tying keratinocyte-neuron communication abnormalities to pain in PIPN. Our findings warrant further assessment of skin biopsies in additional neuropathic pain populations to gain insight into DRG neuron changes that have previously been thought to be inaccessible in routine clinical or scientific assessment in most patients.",

    "title": "Biomimetic Cues Enable Predictive Mechanisms in Simulatedand Physical Robot-Human Object Handovers",
    "content": "Object handovers - while representing one of the simplest forms of physical interaction between two agents - involve a complex interplay of predictive and reactive control mechanisms in both agents. As human-human pairs have unrivaled skills in physical collaboration tasks, we take the approach of understanding and applying biomimetic concepts to human-robot interaction. Here, we apply the concept of passer movement cues, that is, slower movement for heavy objects and faster movements for lighter objects, to robot-human handovers. We first show that when a simulated passing agent's movement is scaled with object mass, participants as receivers adapt their anticipatory grip forces according to mass in a virtual environment. We then apply the same concept to a physical robot-human handover and show that our approach generalizes to the real-world. The predictive scaling of grip forces is learned iteratively upon repeated presentations of trajectory-mass pairings, whether the masses are presented in a random or blocked order. Overall we demonstrate that the presentation of robotic kinematic cues can provide intuitive and naturalistic human predictive control in object handover. This extends the use of non-verbal cues in robot-human handover tasks and facilitates more legible and efficient physical robot-human interactions.",

    "title": "Microglial morphology reflects cognitive status in the aging rat brain",
    "content": "Age-related cognitive decline affects millions of individuals worldwide, but the cellular mechanisms underlying this decline remain incompletely understood. Microglia undergo significant changes with aging, including alterations in morphology, that may reflect or contribute to cognitive dysfunction. However, the relationship between specific microglial morphologies and cognitive performance in relevant brain regions remains poorly understood. To address this, we evaluated the relationship between morphology-based microglial phenotypes and cognitive performance across domains affected by aging. Microglial morphology was analyzed in four cognitive brain regions of male and female 3-, 9-, and 15-month-old rats and features were subjected to hierarchical clustering on principal components to identify microglial subtypes. Rats underwent cognitive testing using a radial arm water maze and a T-maze set-shifting task to assess spatial working and reference memory, striatal-based learning, and cognitive flexibility. We observed age-related cognitive impairments alongside region-specific changes in microglial morphotype abundance. Importantly, the relative abundance of distinct microglial clusters correlated with cognitive performance in functionally relevant brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the hippocampus. Taken together, these findings highlight the utility of morphological profiling in capturing microglial heterogeneity and suggest that morphological changes may reflect or contribute to cognitive decline during aging.",

    "content": "Higher brain functions and cognition undergo a critical period of development during adolescence, when psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia typically onset. Understanding how developmental processes during adolescence interact with schizophrenia pathophysiology and risk remains a central goal in psychiatry. Here we show that a well-established biomarker of schizophrenia, mismatch negativity, matures during adolescence in mouse primary visual cortex, along with a strengthening of fronto-visual functional connectivity. Because microglia are implicated in schizophrenia risk and disease states, we further investigated what role microglia may play in the development of mismatch responses under physiological conditions. We found that microglial depletion with PLX5622 in adolescence arrests the development of resting oscillations in frontal areas, but does not affect the development of deviance detection, other signatures of visual context processing, or prefrontal-visual functional connectivity. Our findings suggest (a) a key component of mismatch negativity develops in adolescence, a period of vulnerability to schizophrenia, and (b) the development underlying this component does not require robust microglia activity, clarifying the developmental role of microglia in higher order visual processing.",

    "title": "Gene therapy-mediated overexpression of wild-type MFN2 improves Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A",
    "content": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A) is the most common axonal CMT and is associated with an early onset and severe motor-dominant phenotype. CMT2A is mainly caused by dominant mutations in the MFN2 gene, encoding Mitofusin-2, a GTPase located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations in MFN2 are known to affect mitochondrial dynamics. We previously demonstrated that the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln further disrupts contacts between the ER and the mitochondria, leading to progressive axonal degeneration. There is no effective therapeutic approach to slow or reverse the progression of CMT2A, and treatments currently under development primarily focus on restoring mitochondrial function. Here, we provide proof-of-concept that neuronal overexpression of wild-type MFN2 (MFN2WT) provides therapeutic benefit in transgenic CMT2A mice carrying the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln. Intrathecal delivery of an AAV9 vector expressing MFN2WT effectively targets motor and sensory neurons, restoring ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial morphology, thereby preserving both neuromuscular junction integrity and motor function. Strikingly, therapeutic efficacy is also achieved following vector injection after the onset of symptoms, rescuing the molecular hallmarks of CMT2A pathology and reversing locomotor. Notably, AAV administration was well tolerated, with no evidence neither of hepatotoxicity nor dorsal root ganglion inflammation. These results establish that boosting MFN2 levels using gene therapy is a promising therapeutic avenue for CMT2A",

    "title": "Representational Competition of Spatially and Temporally Overlapped Target and Distractor",
    "content": "Representational competition occurs when a task-relevant target stimulus and a distractor overlap in space and time. Given limited neural resources, it is expected that stronger representations of the distractor will result in weaker representations of the target, leading to poorer behavioral performance. We tested this hypothesis by recording fMRI while participants (n = 27) viewed a compound stimulus consisting of randomly moving dots (the target) superimposed on IAPS affective pictures (the distractor). Each trial lasted ~12 seconds, during which the moving dots and the IAPS pictures were flickered at 4.29 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively. The task was to detect and report brief episodes of coherent motion in the moving dots. Depending on the emotion category of the IAPS pictures, the trials were classified as pleasant, neutral and unpleasant. Focusing on three ROIs: middle temporal cortex (MT), ventral visual cortex (VVC), as well as the primary visual cortex (V1), we performed MVPA analysis to decode the distractor categories in each ROI, and correlated the decoding accuracy, taken to index the strength of distractor representation, with the accuracy in detecting the episodes of coherent motion. The following results were found: (1) the decoding accuracy was above chance level in all ROIs, and (2) in MT and VVC but not in V1, the higher the decoding accuracy, the worse the behavioral performance. These results suggested that distractor information was represented in V1 as well as in the two motion-processing areas, and in the motion-processing areas, stronger representations of the distractor led to poorer ability to process attended information, leading to worse behavioral performance. The hypothesis was thus supported and trade-offs in the fidelity of stimulus representations prompted by neural competition demonstrated.",

    "title": "I built a modern async Python SDK for Expo Push Notifications (with full type hints!)",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've been working with Expo push notifications in Python and got frustrated with the limitations of existing SDKs - no async support, limited type safety, and missing modern features. So I built **async-expo-push-notifications**.</p> <p>## What My Project Does</p> <p>A Python SDK for sending push notifications through Expo's push notification service. It provides both async and sync interfaces for sending notifications to mobile apps built with Expo/React Native. The library handles message validation, batching, error handling, and provides full type safety with Pydantic models.</p> <p>## Target Audience</p> <p>**Production-ready** for developers building:</p> <p>- FastAPI/Django/ETC backends that need async push notifications</p> <p>- Python servers communicating with Expo/React Native mobile apps</p> <p>- Applications requiring type-safe, testable notification systems</p> <p>- High-performance apps sending concurrent notifications</p> <p>Requires Python 3.8+ and works with any modern Python web framework.</p> <p>## Comparison</p> <p>Compared to the existing [expo-server-sdk-python](<a href=\"https://github.com/expo-community/expo-server-sdk-python):\">https://github.com/expo-community/expo-server-sdk-python):</a></p> <p>| Feature | async-expo-push-notifications | expo-server-sdk-python |</p> <p>|---------|------------------------------|------------------------|</p> <p>| Async/await support | \u2705 Full async | \u274c Sync only |</p> <p>| Type hints | \u2705 Complete | \u26a0\ufe0f Partial |</p> <p>| Pydantic models | \u2705 Type-safe validation | \u274c Named tuples |</p> <p>| Dependency injection | \u2705 Testable | \u274c No |</p> <p>| Rich content (images) | \u2705 Supported | \u274c No |</p> <p>| Backward compatible | \u2705 Drop-in replacement | - |</p> <p>The official SDK is great for synchronous use cases, but lacks modern Python features. This SDK provides the same API while adding async support, full type safety, and better testability - perfect for modern async Python applications.</p> <p>## Quick Example</p> <p>```python</p> <p>import asyncio</p> <p>from exponent_server_sdk import AsyncPushClient, PushMessage</p> <p>async def send_notification():</p> <p>async with AsyncPushClient() as client:</p> <p>message = PushMessage(</p> <p>to=&quot;ExponentPushToken[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]&quot;,</p> <p>title=&quot;Hello&quot;,</p> <p>body=&quot;World!&quot;,</p> <p>data={&quot;extra&quot;: &quot;data&quot;}</p> <p>)</p> <p>ticket = await client.publish(message)</p> <p>ticket.validate_response()</p> <p>asyncio.run(send_notification())</p> <p>```</p> <p>**Installation:**</p> <p>```bash</p> <p>pip install async-expo-push-notifications</p> <p>```</p> <p>The synchronous API still works exactly the same, so you can migrate gradually. All your existing code continues to work without changes.</p> <p>**Why I built this:**</p> <p>The official community SDK is great but hasn't been updated with modern Python features. I wanted something that works seamlessly with async frameworks like FastAPI and provides the type safety that modern Python developers expect.</p> <p>**Important note:** This is an independent project and not officially maintained by Expo. It's a modern reimplementation with async support.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmdgusya/async-expo-notification-sdk\">https://github.com/tmdgusya/async-expo-notification-sdk</a></p> <p>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/async-expo-push-notifications/\">https://pypi.org/project/async-expo-push-notifications/</a></p> <p>Would love to hear your feedback and contributions are welcome!

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "Detecting salient visual objects and orienting toward them are commonplace tasks for animals, yet the underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. The fruit fly is an ideal model for a comprehensive analysis of feature detection mechanisms given its complete synaptic wiring diagrams, robust behavioral assays, and cell-type-specific gene expression datasets. We previously showed that columnar visual neurons T3 are required for saccadic orientation toward landscape features during flight. Here, we examine how signals downstream of T3 are processed in the central brain. We identify the LC17 type of visual projection neurons as key postsynaptic targets: they receive strong excitatory input from T3, project to premotor brain regions, and are thus positioned to support visual approach. Using in vivo optical physiology and virtual reality behavior, we demonstrate that LC17 neurons are indeed necessary for object tracking during flight. Furthermore, we find that electrical synapses in LC17 are also required for tracking behavior. Accordingly, we show that the innexin Shaking B (shakB) is highly expressed in LC17 dendrites, and genetic perturbations confirm an essential role for gap junctional coupling in this circuit. Our findings reveal mechanisms underlying visual approach, and highlight the interplay between electrical and chemical neurotransmission for rapid object detection and action selection.",

    "title": "Region-specific human brain organoids reveal synaptic and cell state drivers of glioblastoma invasion",
    "content": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly heterogenous and malignant brain tumor, in part because it disrupts normal brain circuits to fuel its own growth and invasion. Thus, there is a need to identify the molecular features of invasive GBM cells and their regulators in the neural microenvironment. To address this in a fully human model, we engrafted patient-derived GBM cells (total n=15 independent samples) from three sources - fresh neurosurgical resections, cell lines, and whole GBM organoids - into human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids patterned to forebrain, midbrain, and spinal cord identities. GBM cells from all sources infiltrated brain organoids within 2 days post-engraftment, reaching maximal invasion by day 14. Across organoids of distinct spatial and maturational milieu, GBM cells showed a consistent reduction in astrocyte-like states and an enrichment in neuron/glia progenitor-like (NPC-like) states. These NPC-like GBM cells expressed neuronal and synaptic machinery, and tumors enriched in this transcriptomic state prior to engraftment achieved greater organoid coverage, suggesting enhanced infiltration and synaptic integration of this GBM cell type. Although GBM cell states converged across organoid types after engraftment, infiltration was greater in the forebrain than spinal cord. This is likely reflective of synaptic input from deep-layer TBR1 excitatory neurons in the forebrain, as demonstrated by a combination of rabies-based monosynaptic tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. In contrast, inhibitory neurons were the predominant synaptic partners of GBM in the spinal cord. Together, this fully human model of the neural-GBM connectome reveals how neuron-like GBM states and regionally distinct synaptic inputs cooperatively shape tumor invasion.",

    "title": "Functional and Structural Plasticity in Cocaine-Seeking Ensembles of the Nucleus Accumbens Core",
    "content": "Relapse vulnerability in substance use disorder (SUD) is primarily driven by cue-induced activation of neurons within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore), among other contributing factors. Neuronal ensembles within the NAcore, defined here as selectively co-activated neurons during specific behavioral experiences, are essential during cocaine sensitization and recall. While transient synaptic plasticity (t-SP) has been widely observed in general neuronal populations within the NAcore during reinstatement, its ensemble-specific dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used c-Fos-TRAP2-based tagging to identify cocaine-seeking ensembles in mice following cocaine intravenous self-administration, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement. Structural spine plasticity was assessed via confocal microscopy, and functional changes were measured using whole-cell electrophysiology across multiple reinstatement time points. Ensemble neurons exhibited enhanced dendritic spine head diameter (dh) and AMPA/NMDA (A/N) ratios following cue exposure, consistent with t-SP. Notably, spine classification revealed a reduction in mature spines during reinstatement, suggesting morphological remodeling rather than new spine formation in both ensemble and non-ensemble cells. Non-ensemble neurons exhibited classical functional transient synaptic plasticity, characterized by increased A/N ratios but no significant changes in dh. To begin assessing if presynaptic vesicle release impacts t-SP, paired-pulse ratio analysis indicated no differences in population or time point. Importantly, ensemble neurons displayed elevated A/N ratio following cocaine exposure, suggesting prior silent synapse maturation. These findings demonstrate that t-SP is not uniformly distributed across NAcore neurons but differs significantly between ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. By linking ensemble identity to both structural and functional plasticity, this study refines our understanding of cue-induced relapse mechanisms.",

    "title": "Iron Deficiency Impairs Mitochondrial Energetics and Early Axonal Growth and Branching in Developing Hippocampal Neurons",
    "content": "Each stage of neuronal development (i.e., proliferation, differentiation, migration, neurite outgrowth and synapse formation) requires functional and highly coordinated metabolic activity to ultimately ensure proper sculpting of complex neural networks. Energy deficits underlie many neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases implicating mitochondria as a potential therapeutic target. Iron is necessary for neuronal energy output through its direct role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Iron deficiency (ID) reduces mitochondrial respiratory and energy capacity in developing hippocampal neurons, causing permanently simplified dendritic arbors and impaired learning and memory. However, the effect of ID on early axonogenesis has not been explored. We used an embryonic mixed-sex primary mouse hippocampal neuron culture model of developmental ID to evaluate mitochondrial respiration and dynamics and effects on axonal morphology. At 7 days in vitro (DIV), ID impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity and stunted growth of both the primary axon and branches, without affecting branch number. Mitochondrial motility was not altered by ID, suggesting that mitochondrial energy production --- not trafficking --- underlie the axon morphological deficits. These findings provide the first link between iron-dependent neuronal energy production and early axon structural development and emphasize the importance of maintaining sufficient iron during gestation to prevent the negative consequences of ID on brain health across the lifespan.",

Sensory substitution, achieved through tactile displays embedded in transfemoral prosthetic sockets, presents a promising non-invasive solution to provide artificial sensation to users. However, for this approach to be effective, users must accurately perceive distinct combinations of vibrations, a capacity limited by their...",

    "title": "Ptf1a robustly drives the gliogenic switch in the rodent embryonic cortex in a dosage-dependent manner by activating pro-glial gene expression programs",
    "content": "It is widely believed that the gliogenic switch during rodent embryonic development is governed by the orchestrated crosstalk between a cohort of genes and extracellular cues. Here we report that ectopic expression of the single bHLH factor, pancreas transcription factor 1 (PTF1A), is sufficient to drive radial glial progenitors (RGPs)-regardless of progenitor heterogeneity and developmental stage-to differentiate into glial cells. Ptf1a-expressing RGPs exhibit progenitor behaviors indicative of a neurogenic-to-gliogenic fate transition, resembling endogenous progenitors at the late stages of embryonic development, and preferentially produce OLIG2+ oligodendrocytes in vivo, some of which are positive for PDGFR or CC1. This robust gliogenic competency depends on the dosage of stable Ptf1a expression in RGPs. RNAseq reveals 'the glial transcriptome', including upregulated expression of several notch signaling components and the endothelin receptors in Ptf1a RGPs. We further identify Ednrb as one of the downstream targets of Ptf1a that directs RGPs toward gliogenesis via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In summary, our study uncovers a novel and robust role for Ptf1a in glial fate specification, offering a potential strategy for generating human oligodendrocytes in vitro.",

    "title": "Parallel circadian-like oscillations in LTP and excitation inhibition balance in mouse CA1 reverse direction after puberty",
    "content": "Long-term potentiation (LTP), the best characterized form of Hebbian synaptic plasticity, is well known to be under strong circadian regulation. In mice and rats, both nocturnal species, most studies indicate that LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region is more robust when induced during the dark phase. Our examination of the underlying mechanisms at the CA3 to CA1 synapse provides evidence that the capacity to express LTP does not differ between the light and dark cycles of the 24hour day. Instead, the magnitude of theta-burst stimulation induced LTP (TBSLTP) correlates with daily fluctuations in the ratio of synaptic excitation to inhibition (E/I ratio): both the E/I ratio and TBSLTP are higher during the dark phase. Consistent with a causal relationship, blockade of inhibition abolishes the light dark difference in TBS LTP induction, likewise, pairing induced LTP, which is less constrained by inhibitory recruitment, does not differ between cycles. Supporting this model, using the APP/PS1 model of AD we observed that neither the E/I ratio nor TBSLTP change during the light cycle. Finally, we made the intriguing observation that these daily oscillations reverse direction after puberty in WT mice, shifting from being larger in the dark cycle of 2month old mice to being larger in the light cycle in 8month old mice. This developmental switch may reflect an age-dependent reorganization of circadian control over hippocampal plasticity.",

    "title": "Auditory Stimulus Information Entropy Modulates Inter-Brain Synchronization: Evidence from Wireless EEG Hyperscanning",
    "content": "Inter-brain synchronization (IBS) -- reflecting inter-individual correlated neural activity during interaction -- marks shared experiences like music listening. The ability of complex auditory stimuli (e.g., music) to induce IBS links to their information dynamics, notably the uncertainty they evoke, which challenges the nervous system's predictive coding. Based on mutual prediction theory (interacting individuals simultaneously process their own behavior and predict their partner's; accurate mutual predictions lead to convergent neural representations and thus IBS), this study hypothesized that higher stimulus uncertainty enhances IBS (heightened uncertainty reduces independent predictability, promoting convergent representations and stronger IBS). Using information entropy to quantify uncertainty, the study conducted hyperscanning, manipulated entropy across Resting State and 6 Hz auditory stimuli (ASSR, MMN, AHER, Dream Wedding), and measured IBS via phase-locking values (PLV). Results showed frequency specificity: 6 Hz PLV increased with entropy (DW {approx} AHER > MMN {approx} ASSR > Resting State); Alpha band had highest PLV in Resting State. Critically, PLVs differed significantly between any two conditions, and each experimental condition's PLV was also significantly different from that of the Resting State. Findings confirm a 6 Hz-specific positive association between auditory uncertainty and IBS, suggesting musical elements may facilitate social interaction by modulating entropy, with entropy-IBS relations showing frequency dependence.",

    "title": "AAV-mediated overexpression of Prdm12 in knee-innervating afferents reduces inflammatory joint pain and neuronal hyperexcitability in mice",
    "content": "Inflammatory joint pain features in numerous musculoskeletal disorders that affect millions globally. The Prdm12 gene encodes a conserved zinc finger transcriptional regulator expressed selectively in the nervous system. In humans, PRDM12 mutations can cause congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) or midface toddler excoriation syndrome (MiTES). Prdm12 is prominently expressed in developing somatosensory ganglia, where it plays a crucial role in nociceptive neuron development, its expression being maintained in mature C-LTMRs (C-low threshold mechanoreceptors) and nociceptive neurons. Despite enhanced understanding of Prdm12's role in neuronal excitability and pain behavior, the impact of Prdm12 overexpression in mature nociceptive neurons has not been explored. Here, we conducted intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.S viral vectors encoding Prdm12-GFP (Prdm12-AAV) or GFP alone (Control-AAV), observing no overt changes in mouse behavior. When examining the properties of Prdm12 overexpressing sensory neurons in vitro, we observed an increase in rheobase alongside decreased neuronal responses to capsaicin and ATP, indicating a downregulation of TRPV1 and P2X ion channels activity, respectively. We next conducted intraarticular administration of viral constructs in female mice to determine how Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating sensory neurons alters their excitability and influences inflammatory joint pain induced by intraarticular administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating neurons decreased inflammation-induced changes in digging and weight bearing, prevented inflammation-induced neuronal hyperexcitability, and decreased macroscopic voltage-gated ion channel conductance. Our findings illustrate that Prdm12 overexpression strongly modulates neuronal excitability in adult animals, highlighting its importance in pain perception and its potential as an analgesic target.",

    "title": "The impact of the serotonergic psychedelic DOI on active vision in freely moving mice",
    "content": "Psychedelic compounds have the ability to generate altered states of consciousness and profoundly distort perception, often resulting in visual hallucinations. While psychedelics have recently regained attention for their potential cognitive and therapeutic effects, how these drugs affect visual processing to generate visual distortions and hallucinations is not as well characterized. Furthermore, studies investigating the effect of psychedelics on visual function have all been done using head-fixed preparations, preventing animals from engaging in the natural visual behaviors that the visual system evolved to support. To determine the impact of psychedelics on active vision, we recorded neural activity in primary visual cortex (V1) of mice during free movement, while simultaneously recording eye and head position, before and after administration of the serotonergic psychedelic DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine). We find that DOI increases the frequency of visual active sensing behaviors during free movement and leads to a net reduction in the visually-evoked activity that these behaviors generate in V1. The effect of DOI was highly diverse across the population of V1 neurons, driving suppression and facilitation of visual responses in a laminar specific manner. Finally, the effects of DOI were dependent upon both visual input and the statistics of the stimulus. We found a striking dissociation between impact on gaze shift responses and flashed sparse noise presented during head-fixation, which may reflect predictability of the stimulus. These findings provide insights into how psychedelics disrupt sensory processing and the neural mechanisms underlying these altered perceptual states.",

    "title": "Adolescent Alcohol Exposure Disrupts Astrocyte-Synaptic Structural And Functional Coupling In The Male Dorsal Hippocampus",
    "content": "Adolescence is a window of heightened vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of binge ethanol exposure. Adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure has been shown to induce long lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments in patients and rodent models that increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). Our previous work shows that these behavioral deficits coincide with persistent dysfunction of astrocytes. Here, we aim to understand how astrocyte synaptic structural and functional crosstalk are disrupted following AIE to provide better mechanistic understanding of why behavioral impairments persist into adulthood. Male Sprague Dawley rats received AIE, a variety of adeno-associated viruses encoding astrocyte specific sensors, and fiber implantation in the dorsal hippocampal (dHipp) for in vivo photometry. A subset of rats received hM3D(Gq) to chemogenetically activate astrocytes. Following AIE and a forced abstinence period that allowed growth into adulthood, rats underwent assessment in the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) task with simultaneous fiber photometry recordings. By combining immunohistochemistry (IHC), Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy, fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and slice physiology, we show that AIE induces structural and functional decoupling of astrocytes from synapses and astrocyte dysregulation that persists into adulthood. Remarkably, stimulating astrocytic calcium signaling via chemogenetic activation attenuates heightened fear responding and restores gliotransmitter availability. These findings highlight a critical role for astrocyte synaptic crosstalk in regulating fear learning and underscore the untapped therapeutic potential of targeting astrocytes to improve behavioral outcomes following substance use.",

    "title": "ARHGEF17 Deficiency Induces Endothelial Dysfunction and Intracranial Aneurysm Formation via RhoA/ROCK2/MLC Signaling Pathway",
    "content": "BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility critically contributes to intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation and rupture, but the mechanisms linking genetic variants to vascular dysfunction remain unclear. ARHGEF17, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor regulating RhoA activation and cytoskeletal dynamics, has been identified as a potential IA risk gene. METHODS: CRISPR-Cas9-generated ARHGEF17-/- mice and morpholino-based ARHGEF17-deficient zebrafish were used to assess in vivo vascular effects. An elastase/DOCA-induced IA model evaluated aneurysm formation, rupture, and survival. Vascular remodeling of the Circle of Willis was analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence. Endothelial function was examined in HUVECs with lentiviral ARHGEF17 knockdown. Activation of RhoA/ROCK2/MLC signaling was assessed by G-LISA and Western blotting, with Y-27632 used to test ROCK2 dependence. RESULTS: ARHGEF17 deficiency increased IA incidence and rupture, accompanied by elastic fiber fragmentation, VSMC dedifferentiation, and inflammatory activation. Zebrafish lacking ARHGEF17 exhibited intracranial hemorrhage and vascular instability. In endothelial cells, ARHGEF17 silencing impaired proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and barrier integrity while activating the RhoA/ROCK2/MLC pathway. ROCK inhibition with Y-27632 restored endothelial function and cytoskeletal organization. CONCLUSIONS: ARHGEF17 maintains cerebrovascular integrity by regulating RhoA/ROCK2/MLC-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics. Its deficiency drives endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and IA formation, while ROCK inhibition reverses these effects, identifying the RhoA/ROCK2 axis as a therapeutic target for ARHGEF17 mutation-associated IAs.",

    "title": "Effects of color-enhancing filters on color salience in normal trichromats",
    "content": "Notch filters can alter color contrasts by selectively filtering different spectral bands of the stimulus and have been developed to enhance reddish-greenish contrasts for color-deficient observers with anomalous trichromacy. We examined the effects of such filters on color salience for normal trichromats, using a visual search paradigm where the task was to locate a color target superimposed on a variegated chromatic background, similar to foraging for fruits among foliage. Background colors varied along a bluish-yellowish or purplish to yellow-green (short-wave cone isolating) axis, roughly spanning the range of dominant color variations in arid or lush environments. Target colors sampled a wide range of hue angles and contrasts. Testing was conducted on a computer monitor, with the filter effects simulated by calculating corresponding chromaticities with or without the filter for naturalistic (Munsell) reflectances. The filter evaluated (Enchroma SuperX glasses) was designed to increase color contrast along a magenta-green axis. Consistent with this, search times for targets on the blue-yellow background were significantly faster for the filter condition, because the filter increased the target-background color difference. Alternatively, overall differences in search times were not observed for the S-cone background. The differences on the two backgrounds could be qualitatively accounted for by the relative salience of the stimuli predicted by a perceptual color space (CIELAB). Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the filters for enhancing visual performance for normal trichromats and naturalistic tasks, and illustrate how these effects depend on the potential color characteristics of the environment.",

    "title": "Artificial microRNAs targeting Tau enable post-symptomatic functional recovery in aged tauopathy mice",
    "content": "Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy, characterized by the pathological accumulation of tau protein. While tau reduction has emerged as a promising disease-modifying strategy, most preclinical studies have focused on preventive approaches, and the therapeutic potential after clinical onset remains largely unexplored. This limitation is critical, as patients are typically diagnosed after symptoms emerge. Furthermore, global tau suppression may disrupt physiological tau functions and lead to adverse effects, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. RNA-based therapies, particularly microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing, offer high specificity, versatility, and sustained target knockdown. Here, we developed artificial microRNAs (Tau-miRNAs) designed for site-directed expression to selectively reduce tau levels in vulnerable brain regions, thereby minimizing off-target effects. We tested the efficacy of Tau-miRNAs in a tauopathy mouse model at advanced disease stages, delivering them into the prefrontal cortex after cognitive and electrophysiological deficits had developed. This post-symptomatic intervention led to long-term improvements in memory, restoration of neuronal firing properties, and reduced pathological tau at synapses. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of spatially targeted RNA-based tau-lowering strategies for late-stage intervention in tauopathies, addressing a critical unmet need in the treatment of these devastating disorders.",

    "title": "Heterogeneity of ictal firing during generalized seizures in the awake cortex",
    "content": "Cortico-thalamo-cortical oscillations are central to both normal and pathological brain activities and emerge from complex cortical and thalamic interactions. However, the specific activity of identified cortical neurons during the paroxysmal oscillations associated with absence seizures (ASs) in awake animals remains underexplored. The dominant narrative suggests that seizures indiscriminately disrupt cortical activity through generalized hyperexcitability, but direct evidence supporting this view is lacking. Here, we recorded single units from pyramidal neurons and different interneuron subtypes in the neocortex of two validated rodent models of absence epilepsy under awake, behaving conditions. We find that neurons maintain their firing rank order across interictal and ictal states, regardless of whether their ictal firing rate increases, decreases, or remains stable compared to the interictal phase. Rather than a random cortical takeover, ictal activity represents a scalable modulation of pre-existing network states. These results challenge the generalized hyperexcitability model and highlight the structured, heterogeneous nature of cortical activity during ASs, with implications for mechanistic understanding and targeted therapies.",

    "title": "Distinct cortical profiles underlie the common reportability of thought-free experiences",
    "content": "Mind blanking (MB) is a mental state of seemingly no reportable thought content. The question of how we can entertain no thoughts while awake is challenging for the study of spontaneous thinking. By combining EEG-fMRI with experience sampling during task performance, we categorised changes in mental content and self-reported vigilance to map the neurophysiological signatures of MB. We demonstrate that fMRI connectivity around MB reports is characterised by a \"rich\" pattern of long and short-range signal anticorrelations. At the same time, sleepiness reports are linked to a \"simpler\" hyperconnected fMRI pattern, characterised by overall positive connectivity. Put together, an interaction appears: when people report being alert, connectomes around MB reports resemble the hyperconnected pattern, indicating that the neuronal correlates of MB depend on self-rated vigilance. The hyperconnected pattern also correlated with EEG slow wave activity, tying MB's topology to sleep-like electrophysiology during wakefulness. Collectively, we show that distinct cortical events underlie the shared phenomenology of a thought-free mind. We conclude that MB's neurophysiological correlates vary across perceived vigilance levels and that more refined characterisation of the neuronal correlates of thought-less mental states exist. Our findings build on the quest to bridge mental content and its absence with measurable brain activity and provide insights into how ongoing thinking is maintained during wakefulness.",

    "content": "Determining if repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) proteins contribute to the CAG polyGln-encoding spinocerebellar ataxias (CAG-SCAs) is critical for understanding mechanisms and developing therapies for these diseases. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against polySer and polyLeu repeats and locus specific C-terminal regions show sense polySer (AGC frame) and antisense polyLeu (CUG frame) RAN proteins accumulate in affected grey and white-matter brain regions, throughout the cerebellum and pons, in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 autopsy brains. Cerebellar white matter regions with prominent polySer and polyLeu but minimal polyGln aggregates show demyelination, white matter loss, and activated microglia. In SCA3 mice, RAN proteins accumulate in an age-dependent manner. In neural cells, polySer and polyLeu RAN proteins are toxic and cause autophagic dysfunction. In cells, the FDA-approved drug metformin decreases RAN protein levels and reduces toxicity. Taken together, these data identify sense and antisense RAN proteins as a common molecular mechanism shared by the CAG-SCAs.",

    "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location.

In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "BDNF-induced axonal mTOR activation promotes Rab5 translation, axonal transport, and CREB phosphorylation in cortical neurons.",
    "content": "Neuronal plasticity, essential for learning and memory, involves structural changes triggered by neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF activates its receptor, TrkB, to induce local and long-distance signaling, promoting dendritic branching. While BDNF activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is well-documented in dendritic spines, its role in axons remains unclear. Using compartmentalized cultures of embryonic cortical neurons from mice, this study demonstrates that axonal BDNF triggers mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of translation regulators (4E-BP1 and S6), driving local protein synthesis. Fluorescent labeling, immunostaining, and radial microfluidic chambers were employed to isolate axonal compartments and assess local translation. Axonal BDNF increased Rab5 protein translation in a TrkB- and mTOR-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of localized protein synthesis for axonal trafficking. Furthermore, axonal protein synthesis was required for retrograde transport of internalized cargoes and CREB activation in the nucleus, linking local translation to long-distance signaling. These findings highlight the crucial role of axonal mTOR activation in regulating local proteostasis and neuronal function, offering new insights into axonal trafficking mechanisms and their implications for neuroplasticity. This work advances our understanding of how mTOR activation in axons and localized translation induced by BDNF are essential for axonal transport and efficient signaling in cortical neurons.",

    "title": "Hunger Recruits a Parallel Circuit Encoding Alcohol Reward",
    "content": "Internal states like hunger, pain, thirst and arousal can bias behavior by affecting sensory and memory processing. Internal states are critical to understand in the context of alcohol addiction because they influence cravings, reinstatement, and relapse. Norepinephrine plays a key role in both hunger and alcohol-induced arousal and preference, but the circuit-level mechanisms through which it modulates the influence of hunger on alcohol preference are not well understood. We sought to address this using intersectional genetic tools for manipulating neurons expressing octopamine, the invertebrate analogue of vertebrate norepinephrine. We identified a single octopamine neuron required for ethanol seeking only when Drosophila are food-deprived. Hunger increased baseline activity in this neuron, making it more responsive to an odor cue previously paired with ethanol. A combination of genetic and connectome analyses revealed that synaptic partners of this octopaminergic neuron form a functional module that acts on Drosophila memory circuitry. Thus, we show that hunger recruits a parallel circuit that drives learned ethanol preference, providing a neuronal framework through which internal state influences the expression of memory for ethanol-associated cues.",

    "title": "Psilocybin exerts differential effects on social behaviour and inflammation in mice in contexts of activity-based anorexia (ABA)",
    "content": "Psychedelics, particularly psilocybin, have shown therapeutic potential across several psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anorexia nervosa (AN). These disorders often share social deficits that may be effectively alleviated by psychedelics considering their use has been linked with emotional empathy and enhanced social cognition. However, the mechanisms through which psychedelics alter social behaviour are unclear, and mechanistic studies in animal models have largely focused on male subjects. This is problematic for understanding the therapeutic effects relevant for disorders that predominantly affect females, such as AN. Here, we used the activity-based anorexia (ABA) mouse model to examine the effects of a single psilocybin dose on social behaviour in female mice and compared outcomes to mice exposed to food restriction (FR), exercise (RW) or standard housing (Controls). Together with these metabolic stressors, we also investigated the effects of psilocybin on the circulating proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is implicated in AN and is suppressed by psychedelics. Psilocybin did not alter sociability in ABA, RW, or FR mice but increased preference for familiarity in Controls. Novelty-seeking behaviour was elevated in both ABA and RW groups, although with distinct social patterns. Psilocybin elevated IL-6 levels in RW mice, which was positively correlated with preference for novelty. No such relationships were found in ABA or FR groups. These findings reveal subtle, context-dependent effects of psilocybin on social behaviour and inflammation in female mice, highlighting the need to clarify its temporal, neuroplastic, and immune-related mechanisms across sexes and disease models.",

    "content": "Motor and declarative memory systems have been traditionally considered distinct. However, a study by Mosha and Robertson (2016) reported striking evidence of generalisation between motor and declarative learning. Specifically, learning improved if the current task (e.g. motor sequence) shared the same high-level ordinal structure as an earlier task (e.g. word list), demonstrating cross-domain transfer of unstable memories. This finding has significant implications for our understanding and conceptualisation of memory taxonomies but has not been replicated. Here, healthy adult participants (N = 125) completed a word list and motor sequence task in counterbalanced order with either a shared or distinct sequence structure. In contrast to Mosha & Robertson (2016), we found that a shared ordinal structure between the declarative and motor sequence tasks did not facilitate performance. Overall, our results challenge the robustness of cross-domain generalisation, and underscore the complexity of cross-memory interactions.",

    "title": "Drift-diffusion dynamics of the hippocampal replay",
    "content": "Replay activities in the hippocampus and other brain regions during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are thought to play important roles in learning, memory, and planning. Surprisingly, the question of how to characterize the dynamical structure of replay remains controversial. Standard methods rely on restrictive assumptions for detecting replay events with high sequentiality, and they have substantial drawbacks. To fill this gap, we develop a flexible and highly interpretable computational framework based on state-space modeling to understand the dynamics of replays. This framework is motivated by the basic idea that sequential structures can be modeled using drift-diffusion dynamics. The two parameters (i.e., drift & diffusion parameters) can be directly mapped to the speed and variability of a replay event, respectively. To capture the potentially rich neural dynamics during SWRs, our model allows the switching between several well-motivated types of dynamics. The resulting framework enables precise and unambiguous interpretations of the dynamics of SWR events. Applications of our method to population recordings from the rat hippocampus lead to insights into a number of important open questions, including: (i) whether the speed of most replay events is comparable to real-world running; (ii) whether replays follow random walk; (iii) whether \"preplay\" events exist. More broadly, accurate characterizations of replay dynamics may lead to a better understanding of the role of replay under normal and abnormal conditions.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

Iman and I (Fabian) have been building Specific for a while now and are finally opening up our public beta.<p>Specific is a platform for building backend APIs and services entirely through natural-language specifications and tests, without writing code. We then automatically turn your specs into a working system and deploy it for you, along with any infrastructure needed.<p>We know a lot of developers who have already adopted spec-driven development to focus on high-level design and let coding agents take care of implementation. We are attempting to take this even further by making the specs themselves the source of truth. Of course, we can\u2019t blindly trust coding agents to follow the spec, so we also support adding tests that will run to ensure the system behaves as expected and to avoid regressions.<p>There is so much ground to cover, so we are focusing on a smaller set of initial features that in our experience should cover a large portion of backends:<p>- An HTTP server for each project. Authentication can be added by simply stating in the spec how you want to protect your endpoint.<p>- A database automatically spun up and schema configured if the spec indicates persistence is needed.<p>- External APIs can be called. You can even link out to API docs in your specs.<p>You currently can\u2019t see the generated code, but we are working on enabling it. Of course, we don\u2019t claim any ownership of the generated code and will gladly let you export it and continue building elsewhere.<p>Specific is free to try and we are really eager to hear your feedback on it!<p>Try it here: <a href=\"https://app.specific.dev\">https://app.specific.dev</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45595760\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45595760</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "A multimodal brain phantom for noninvasive neuromodulation",
    "content": "Noninvasive neuromodulation enables brain stimulation without surgery but requires precise optimization of stimulation parameters to ensure efficacy and safety. Direct testing on human or animal subjects is costly, time intensive, and constrained by ethical and safety considerations. To address these challenges, a low-cost, versatile brain phantom was designed to emulate key biophysical properties across multiple neuromodulation modalities. The phantom was fabricated using ground beef, sodium alginate, and starch, and cast within a custom 3D printed mold. A multimodal test platform was created and validated by integrating established principles from low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and thermal phantom design. Numerical simulations predicted a LIFU peak negative pressure of 0.631 MPa, closely matching the target Pr.3 value, with negligible temperature elevation (<0.01 {degrees}C). Consistent with prior reports, tDCS exposure did not induce lasting alterations in the phantoms physical or electrical properties. The electrical conductivity was 0.11{+/-}0.02 S/m, reflecting water saturation within the phantom matrix; the thermal conductivity averaged 0.557 W/(mK), consistent with reported values for brain tissue analogs. This study primarily evaluated LIFU and tDCS performance; future work should extend characterization to additional modalities such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Further assessment of the phantoms optical properties would also facilitate photobiomodulation and photoacoustic imaging studies. Overall, this inexpensive, easily fabricated phantom presents a practical and adaptable platform for multimodal neuromodulation research and parameter optimization.",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Area MT carries acceleration information in a quickly and directly decodable representation",
    "content": "We sought to better understand the neural representation of visual motion acceleration. A straightforward estimation of acceleration would involve calculating the rate of change of velocity, which itself would be calculated from change in position over time. As it is well-established that neurons in area MT encode velocity, the brain could thus indirectly estimate acceleration by calculating the change in MT's velocity representations. An alternate mechanism, however, could operate more rapidly and directly. In this case, the brain could exploit interactions between MT's standard motion encoding and idiosyncratic temporal dynamics of neural responses. Such direct decoding would thus exploit nonlinearities usually ignored in studies of MT coding. We tested between these two theories by measuring from ensembles of MT neurons while two male awake fixating macaques viewed linearly accelerating motion stimuli. Direct decoding of acceleration from MT was possible on faster time scales, and could be done with higher fidelity, than indirect decoding. Distinct motion acceleration information could thus be efficiently read out from rich and heterogeneous MT ensemble responses, regardless of the mechanisms that give rise to various forms of motion tuning that it exhibits. A similar analysis of activity in the medial superior temporal area (MST) did not suggest this later stage of motion processing has a more refined acceleration representation. Together, these results suggest that the brain may opportunistically exploit nonlinear idiosyncrasies of neural responses to efficiently extract behaviorally relevant information on fast time scales, instead of performing explicit calculation of some variables.",

    "title": "Alpha-synuclein fibrils induce budding of mitochondrial-derived vesicles",
    "content": "Alpha-synuclein aggregation is a hallmark of synucleinopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Several lines of evidence indicate the involvement of mitochondria in the disease pathology. Despite extensive study, the link between alpha-synuclein aggregation and mechanisms of mitochondrial toxicity remains not fully understood. Using high-resolution imaging with electron microscopy, we examined cells exposed to alpha-synuclein fibrils vs control cells with a focus on mitochondria. We found that upon exposure to alpha-synuclein fibrils, mitochondria increase in size, cristae structure gets defects, and mitochondria enhance the budding of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs). MDV formation reflects an evolutionarily conserved mechanism reminiscent of bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV) biogenesis. Structural proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry corroborates this microscopy observation by identifying changes in multiple proteins that regulate cristae structure, MDV formation, and trafficking. Our results provide a new link between alpha-synuclein and mitochondria and identify novel pathways responding to alpha-synuclein aggregates, particularly that alpha-synuclein directly triggers MDV generation. The processes we detected could be of interest for diagnostics and potential therapeutic interventions.",

    "title": "Optic nerve regeneration requires the intracellular domain of LIFRa/CD118",
    "content": "Identifying cell-autonomous and non-autonomous factors that govern retinal ganglion cells' (RGCs) ability to extend axons is an important step in developing therapies to achieve recovery after optic nerve injury. Here we report that the intracellular domain of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR/CD118) is essential for mature RGCs' ability to regenerate injured axons independent of the cognate ligand (LIF) and other therapies. Overexpression of LIFR in adult RGCs induces neurite outgrowth in cultured RGCs and axon regeneration in vivo while strongly amplifying RGCs' response to LIF itself and to unrelated growth factors. Conversely, in loss-of-function studies, down-regulation of LIFR eliminates the pro-regenerative effects of Pten deletion and other potent stimuli. LIFR bidirectionally regulates the constitutive activity of the MAP kinase pathway, in contrast to LIF itself, which primarily activates pSTAT3. Expression of a truncated LIFR lacking the extracellular domain is sufficient to promote axon regeneration and selectively increases the survival of particular RGC subtypes, placing the LIFR intracellular domain as an essential, cell-autonomous regulator of optic nerve regeneration.",

    "title": "Deep Learning of Brain-Behavior Dimensions Identifies Transdiagnostic Biotypes in Youth with ADHD and Anxiety Disorders",
    "content": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in youth and are characterized by substantial heterogeneity and frequent co-occurrence. This transdiagnostic complexity challenges conventional diagnostic frameworks that rely on symptom-based categories, which often obscure underlying dimensional and neurobiological mechanisms and offer limited neurobiological specificity. To address these issues, we developed a deep learning-based brain-behavior modeling framework that integrates clinically salient functional connectivity with cognitive and behavioral measures to identify interpretable dimensions and biologically grounded subtypes (biotypes). We applied our model to the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset comprising 3,508 children aged 9-11 years and revealed two reproducible brain-behavior dimensions that captured variation in cognitive control and emotion-attention regulation. These dimensions further yielded three distinct biotypes, each exhibiting unique symptom profiles and distinct brain development. We tested the robustness and generalizability of the dimensions and corresponding biotypes in an independent cohort of 224 age-matched participants from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and documented their early expression before symptom onset during adolescence. These findings highlight the utility of brain-behavior dimensions for elucidating heterogeneous psychiatric presentations and advance a biologically grounded framework for early classification and potential clinical translation in youth mental health.",

    "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "title": "Statistical characterization of cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics evoked by cortical stimulation in mice",
    "content": "Objective. Statistical models are powerful tools for describing biological phenomena such as neuronal spiking activity. Although these models have been widely used to study spontaneous and stimulated neuronal activity, they have not yet been applied to analyze responses to electrical cortical stimulation. In this study, we present an innovative approach to characterize neuronal responses to electrical stimulation in the mouse cortex, providing detailed insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics. Approach. Our method applies mixture models to analyze the Peri-Stimulus time histogram of each neuron, predicting the probability of spiking at specific latencies following the onset of electrical stimuli. By applying this approach, we investigated neuronal responses to cortical stimulation recorded from the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and sensorimotor-related thalamic nuclei in the mouse brain. Main results. The characterization approach achieved high goodness of fit, and the model features were leveraged by applying machine learning methods for stimulus intensity decoding and classification of brain regions to which a neuron belongs given its response to the stimulus. The random forest model demonstrated the highest F1 scores, achieving 92.86% for stimulus intensity decoding and 84.35% for brain zone classification. Significance. This study presents a novel statistical framework for characterizing neuronal responses to electrical cortical stimulation, providing quantitative insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics. Our approach achieves high accuracy in stimulus decoding and brain region classification, providing valuable contributions for neuroscience research and neuro-technology applications.",

    "title": "Optimized reference region and the effect on test-retest reliability and detection of Parkinson's disease with UCB-J.",
    "content": "[11C]UCB-J is a radioligand targeting synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, used to image synaptic density. For quantification, a small-volume centrum semiovale area was previously optimized as a [11C]UCB-J reference region (CS2mL); however, its high variability resulted in reduced reliability. Herin, we evaluated an alternative reference region method to assess longitudinal test-retest reliability and detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). For estimating distribution volume ratio (DVR), CS2mL and eleven white matter (WM) reference regions (range: 0.5-200 mL) were generated using the Freesurfer WM map. Same-day and longitudinal test-retest variability (TRV) were assessed (24 healthy subjects (HS); n=10 same-day and n=20 longitudinal HRRT scans, range: 7-1028 days). Each reference region was used to evaluate the substantia nigra (SN) and caudate DVRs in HS (n=25) and PD (n=20). The 10mL WM reference region yielded [11C]UCB-J DVR measurements with reduced variability in TRV (same-day: 10mL: 1.2{+/-}5.7%, same-day: CS2mL: -0.9{+/-}9.2% longitudinal: 10mL: 1.5{+/-}7.0%, CS2mL: 1.6{+/-}11.9%,) while maintaining less than 10% volume of distribution difference, compared to CS2mL. Further, a significant difference between PD and HS groups in SN and caudate DVRs was found using 10mL, with greater effect size (Cohen's d 0.61 for SN and 0.66 for caudate) compared to CS2mL (0.38 for SN and 0.43 for caudate).",

    "title": "Ascending propriospinal modulation of thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons during lumbar locomotor activity",
    "content": "Although the autonomic sympathetic system is activated in parallel with locomotion, the underlying neural mechanisms mediating this coordination are not completely understood. Descending exercise or central command signals from hypothalamic and brainstem regions are thought to activate thoracic spinal sympathetic neurons in parallel with descending locomotor commands. In turn, subsets of thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) then increase activation of a constellation of tissues and organs that provide homeostatic and metabolic support during movement and exercise. It is known that neurons within the spinal cord (propriospinal networks) can generate well-coordinated and sustained locomotor activity but whether these propriospinal networks contribute to coordination between locomotor and autonomic systems is unknown. To investigate this, we applied neurochemicals to elicit whole-cord or lumbar-evoked locomotor activity in an in vitro spinal cord preparation, simultaneously recording lumbar ventral root (VR) activity and changes in calcium fluorescence of pre-labelled SPNs in thoracic segments. Using whole-bath drug application to elicit hindlimb locomotor activity, recorded SPN responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) compared to caudal (T8 to T11) segments. When locomotor-inducing neurochemicals were applied only to the lumbar region using a split-bath configuration, SPN population responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) but not caudal (T8 to T9) segments during both tonic and rhythmic VR activity. In both approaches, the greatest numbers of SPNs with increased fluorescence during rhythmic activity were in T6/7, whereas the greatest numbers with unchanged or decreased fluorescence were in caudal segments (T8 to T11). Together these findings reveal a strong ascending lumbar to thoracic integrating communication pathway and may represent a key feature of spinal neural network function normally. Such communication pathways should be further investigated for targeted autonomic function(s) activation and therapeutic benefit after spinal cord injury.",

    "content": "Loneliness is globally acknowledged as a severe and burgeoning health risk, fuelling interest in helping people of all ages form meaningful social connections. One promising approach consists of intergenerational social programs. While behavioural and qualitative evidence derived from such programs promise health and wellbeing benefits, the physiological consequences of repeated intergenerational encounters remain unknown. Insight into physiological changes will shed light on the mechanisms of social connection and inform program design choices. We charted changes in interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) in 31 intergenerational (older/younger adult) and 30 same generation (younger adult) dyads across a six-session art program. At each session, dyads completed self-report measures, drew together and alone, and had their cortical activation recorded with fNIRS. In both groups, INS was greater while dyads drew together than alone. Across sessions, intergenerational dyads' INS decreased and same generation dyads' INS increased. Further findings highlight the promise of INS as a biomarker for changes in loneliness and the development of social relationships.",

    "title": "Network Activity Shapes Inhibitory Synaptic Development in the Mouse Hippocampus",
    "content": "<p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Human speech perception is multisensory, integrating auditory information from the talker's voice with visual information from the talker's face. BOLD fMRI studies have implicated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in processing auditory speech and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in integrating auditory and visual speech, but as an indirect hemodynamic measure, fMRI is limited in its ability to track the rapid neural computations underlying speech perception. Using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, we directly recorded from the STG and STS in 42 epilepsy patients (25F, 17M). Participants identified single words presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats with and without added auditory noise. Seeing the talker's face provided a strong perceptual benefit, improving perception of noisy speech in every participant. Neurally, a subpopulation of electrodes concentrated in mid-posterior STG and STS responded to both auditory speech (latency 71&nbsp;ms) and visual speech (109&nbsp;ms). Significant multisensory enhancement was observed, especially in the upper bank of the STS: compared with auditory-only speech, the response latency for audiovisual speech was 40% faster and the response amplitude was 18% larger. In contrast, STG showed neither faster nor larger multisensory responses. Surprisingly, STS response latencies for audiovisual speech were significantly faster than those in the STG (50&nbsp;ms vs 64&nbsp;ms), suggesting a parallel pathway model in which the STG plays the primary role in auditory-only speech perception, while the STS takes the lead in audiovisual speech perception. Together with fMRI, sEEG provides converging evidence that STS plays a key role in multisensory integration.</p>",

    "title": "Competition between Tool and Hand Motion Impairs Movement Planning in Limb Apraxia",
    "content": "<p>Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared with congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared with congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.</p>",

    "title": "Largely Intact But Less Reliable and Distributed Neural Representations of Subjective Value in Human Opioid Addiction",
    "content": "<p>Addiction, particularly opioid use disorder (OUD), is often characterized by heightened propensity for risk-taking. While tolerance for risk and uncertainty varies across individuals, the elevated risk-taking in people with OUD is assumed to stem from altered cognitive decision-making processes beyond differences due to idiosyncratic yet lawful tolerances. Specifically, the prevailing assumption is that people with addiction exhibit impairments in the internal representation and integration of information that should guide decisions and judgments about what is valuable. Using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the choice behavior of treatment-engaged male and female participants with chronic OUD aligns with the neural encoding of their inferred subjective value (SV) of uncertain (risky and ambiguous) rewards and the evidence for impairment in this neural process. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that canonical value regions [ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex] track the SV of uncertain choice options in both participants with OUD and comparison controls, irrespective of their tolerance for uncertainty. This speaks against a fundamentally impaired subjective valuation process in OUD. However, value representations were less reliably decodable in people with OUD in some value regions (vmPFC) and throughout the brain, especially within the limbic and salience/ventral-attention networks. Thus, while people with OUD engage a neurocomputationally similar process during risky decision-making to controls, they may differ in the fidelity and distribution of SV signals across brain networks.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Zinc is crucial for neuron function, but whether and how labile zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) acts as an intracellular signaling molecule remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using fluorescence imaging. Our findings reveal that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through various pathways induces intracellular acidification, which subsequently elicits Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes that reflect transient increases in cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been recorded in both rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) primary neuron cultures and organotypic mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) hippocampal slice cultures prepared from both males and females. They are specific to neurons and astrocytes but are absent in other cell types we tested including HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and fibroblasts. We further identify Metallothionein III (MT3), a Zn<sup>2+</sup> buffering protein specifically expressed in brain cells, as the source of these Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Reduction in MT3 expression by knockdown with shRNAmiR techniques significantly decreases the amplitude of Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, while overexpression of MT3 in HeLa and COS-7 cells is sufficient to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, demonstrating the crucial roles of MT3 in Zn<sup>2+</sup> release. Lastly, we explore the biological roles of MT3-mediated Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurons. Suppressing Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes with either MT3 knockdown or mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation results in increased dendritic branching in primary rat hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> release from endogenous MT3 acts as a regulatory signal to inhibit dendrite branching and growth, establishing a critical role for Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurite outgrowth and neuronal development.</p>",

Both anatomical and functional evidence have implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including area 32, in these processes, but the dynamics of neural responses in area 32 during naturalistic vocal interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this by recording the activity of single area 32 neurons using chronically implanted ultrahigh-density Neuropixels probes in freely moving male common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) engaged in an antiphonal calling paradigm in which they exchanged long-distance \"phee\" calls with a virtual conspecific. We found that many neurons exhibited complex modulations in discharge rates in response to presented calls, prior to and following self-generated calls, and during the interval between presented and produced vocalizations. These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of area 32 as an audiovocal interface integrating auditory information, cognitive processes, and motor outputs in the service of vocal communication.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via CB<sub>1</sub> cannabinoid receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs), which control pyramidal neuron differentiation, migration, and axonal guidance. Here, we investigated the long-lasting consequences of transient prenatal CB<sub>1</sub>R downregulation within the mouse prefrontal cortex by assessing its impact on gene expression, neuronal electrophysiological properties, and animal behavioral traits. Transient loss of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs as induced by in-utero small-interference RNA electroporation at Embryonic Day 14.5, when upper-layer neurons are generated, arrested cell migration leading to ectopic neurons that populated deep layers. Whole-cell current&ndash;clamp recordings showed that ectopic neurons are less excitable (increased afterhyperpolarization amplitude, decreased sag, lower firing frequency) than deep-layer&ndash;native pyramidal neurons. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), identified by microarray characterization of FACS-sorted electroporated neurons, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cortical development, regulation of cell migration, neurotransmitter secretion, and cytoskeletal organization. Gene set enrichment analysis also supported enrichment in pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders and synaptic function. The gene expression profile of siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived neurons showed DEGs that had been previously associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and autism. Venn diagrams unveiled one common DEG for neuropsychiatric risk databases and CB<sub>1</sub>R expression manipulation, namely, the transcription factor ZBTB20. Prenatal knockdown of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs induced long-lasting behavioral alterations in the adult offspring of either sex, with an impairment of social interaction and motor behavior in siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived adult mice. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in controlling the development of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and support the contribution of altered endocannabinoid signaling to neuropsychiatric vulnerability.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) neurons project to both cortex and thalamus, inducing multiple effects including the modulation of cortical and thalamic firing, and the emergence of high gamma oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP). We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations driven by L6CT neuron activation reflect the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice (both male and female) expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway in awake, head-fixed mice, we presented ramp-and-hold light at different intensities while recording neural activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) and the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) of the thalamus using silicon probes. We found that the activation of S1 L6CT neurons induces high-frequency LFP oscillations in S1 that are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across light intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the temporal evolution of firing rate in S1 and VPm. While most S1 neurons were steadily suppressed, VPm and S1 layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to facilitated within 500&nbsp;ms, suggesting differential recruitment of the intracortical versus cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we found that LFP frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons sculpt the frequency of S1 LFP oscillations through cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits, linking the recurrent interactions mediated by L6CT neurons to the high gamma oscillations observed across physiological and pathological conditions.</p>",

    "title": "ATAD1 Overexpression Enhances Mitochondrial and Peroxisomal Function in Zellweger Syndrome Disorder Models",
    "content": "Zellweger Spectrum Disorders (ZSDs) are caused by mutations in any of the different peroxin (PEX) genes, which are essential for peroxisome biogenesis and function. Clinical features of ZSDs include seizures, leukodystrophy, renal and liver dysfunction, skeletal abnormalities, and they usually result in death during infancy or early childhood. There are no treatments for ZSDs, and their rarity, the large size of the PEX genes, and the numerous different genes, has impaired therapeutic development. We previously demonstrated that ATAD1, a mitochondrial protein quality control chaperone, could correct both mitochondrial and peroxisomal phenotypes in PEX3 patient fibroblasts. In this study, we investigated whether overexpressing ATAD1 could provide similar benefits in PEX1 and PEX6 patient cell lines, which account for over 70% of ZSD cases. We used established PEX6-/- HEK293 cells, patient-derived fibroblasts with pathogenic PEX1 mutations, and newly created zebrafish mutants. Lipidomic profiling of the cell lines demonstrated widespread dysregulation, including accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholines with very-long-chain fatty acids, depletion of plasmalogens and cholesteryl esters containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a decrease in cardiolipins. Overexpressing ATAD1 partly corrected these imbalances, including normalizing VLCFA metabolism in PEX1 fibroblasts and restoring plasmalogens and cardiolipins in PEX6-deficient cells. Mitochondrial function analysis (Seahorse XF) showed that ATAD1 increased basal and ATP-linked respiration in both PEX1- and PEX6-deficient cells, sometimes surpassing the effects of PEX gene re-expression. ATAD1 increased peroxisome numbers in both PEX6 and PEX1 cells. Zebrafish Pex1 mutants exhibited impaired maximal respiration despite normal basal activity, confirming mitochondrial vulnerability in vivo. These findings further confirm a role for ATAD1 as a modifier that improves lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and peroxisome abundance that could function across multiple ZSDs.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "title": "A pipelined, resource-efficient convolutional neural network architecture for detecting and diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using brain sMRI",
    "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory and cognitive function in elderly individuals. Early detection is vital to slow disease progression and enable timely therapeutic intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches for AD, however, often involve high time complexity and significant computational resource utilization, highlighting the need for more efficient automated solutions.MethodsThis study introduces a Resource Efficient Convolutional Neural Network (RECNN) framework for AD detection and diagnosis using brain MRI images. The methodology incorporates three main modules: Gabor transformation, data augmentation, and classification with an anomalous pixel segmentation algorithm. Gabor transforms are employed to enhance spatial frequency features and improve detection rates. Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of training samples. The RECNN classifier is then used for image classification, and functional morphological segmentation is applied to classify affected pixels into mild or advanced stages of AD. Two benchmark datasets are utilized for training and testing the proposed framework.ResultsThe proposed RECNN-based system demonstrated superior detection and classification performance compared with conventional AD detection methods. The model achieved improved accuracy and robustness, with segmentation results enabling the differentiation between mild and advanced AD cases. Comparative evaluation confirmed that RECNN significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high diagnostic reliability.DiscussionThe findings suggest that the RECNN framework offers a resource-efficient and accurate approach for AD detection using MRI data. By combining Gabor-based feature transformation, augmented data diversity, and advanced segmentation, the proposed method provides a scalable and clinically applicable tool for early diagnosis. Future work will extend the model to larger and more diverse datasets and explore hybrid architectures to further enhance diagnostic performance.",

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
    "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

    "title": "Approaches for retraining sEMG classifiers for upper-limb prostheses",
    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

    "title": "Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation does not alter GABA concentration or functional connectivity in the normal visual cortex",
    "content": "IntroductionAnodal direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) of the visual cortex is a potential rehabilitation tool for vision disorders such as amblyopia and macular degeneration. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are currently unknown. When applied to the human motor cortex, a-tDCS reduces the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter that modulates neuroplasticity. Our primary aim was to assess whether the same a-tDCS paradigm alters local GABA concentration when applied to the healthy primary visual cortex. We also measured the effect of a-tDCS on visual cortex resting-state connectivity and sought to replicate reported observations of an association between visual cortex GABA concentration and the dynamics of binocular rivalry.MethodsFourteen participants with normal vision completed two brain imaging sessions at least 48 hours apart. In each session, binocular rivalry dynamics, primary visual cortex GABA and glutamate-glutamine (Glx) concentrations (via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) and resting-state functional connectivity (via task-free fMRI) were measured at baseline. Real or sham a-tDCS (20 min, 2mA) was then applied to the visual cortex in a randomized sequence followed by a second set of MRS and fMRI measurements.ResultsNo between-session effects of a-tDCS on GABA or Glx concentration or resting-state functional connectivity were observed. A pre-planned within-session analysis revealed a significant increase in Glx following a-tDCS that did not withstand multiple comparisons correction. No consistent relationships between binocular rivalry dynamics and GABA concentration were apparent.DiscussionTogether, our results suggest that a-tDCS effects on the visual cortex may differ from the GABA-associated mechanism in motor cortex.",

    "title": "Balancing accuracy and efficiency: co-design of hybrid quantization and unified computing architecture for spiking neural networks",
    "content": "The deployment of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is hindered by a critical algorithm-hardware mismatch: a fundamental trade-off between the accuracy degradation caused by aggressive quantization and the resource redundancy stemming from traditional decoupled hardware designs. To bridge this gap, we present a novel algorithm-hardware co-design framework centered on a Ternary-8-bit Hybrid Weight Quantization (T8HWQ) scheme. Our approach recasts SNN computation into a unified \u201c8-bit \u00d7 2-bit\u201d paradigm by quantizing first-layer weights to 2 bits and subsequent layers to 8 bits. This standardization directly enables the design of a unified PE architecture, eliminating the resource redundancy inherent in decoupled designs. To mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by aggressive first-layer quantization, we first propose a channel-wise dual compensation strategy. This method synergizes channel-wise quantization optimization with adaptive threshold neurons, leveraging reparameterization techniques to restore model accuracy without incurring additional inference overhead. Building upon T8HWQ, we propose a novel unified computing architecture that overcomes the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs by efficiently multiplexing processing arrays. Experimental results support our approach: On CIFAR-100, our method achieves near-lossless accuracy (<0.7% degradation vs. full precision) with a single time step, matching state-of-the-art low-bit SNNs. At the hardware level, implementation results on the Xilinx Virtex 7 platform demonstrate that our unified computing unit conserves 20.2% of lookup table (LUT) resources compared to traditional decoupled architectures. This work delivers a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202fthroughput improvement over state-of-the-art SNN accelerators\u2014with comparable resource utilization and lower power consumption. Our integrated solution thus advances the practical implementation of high-performance, low-latency SNNs on resource-constrained edge devices.",

Based on our analysis, we argue that current BMR does not pose unique ethical challenges compared with other forms of mind reading, and therefore does not yet justify the establishment of a distinct right to mental privacy.",

    "title": "The effect of development on cortical auditory evoked potentials in normal hearing listeners and cochlear implant users",
    "content": "IntroductionCortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs), such as the P1-N1-P2 complex (onset response) and the acoustic change complex (ACC), provide insight into sound detection and discrimination. While their developmental trajectories are well documented in normal-hearing (NH) listeners, less is known about how these responses develop in pediatric cochlear implant (CI) users and how they are affected by background noise.MethodsCAEPs were recorded in quiet and +10 dB SNR noise conditions using long-duration vowel stimuli from 91 children and 11 adults with NH and 59 CI users (48 pre-lingually deafened children/young adults and 11 post-lingually deafened adults). Peak latencies (P1, N1, P2) and N1-P2 amplitudes were measured. Developmental effects were analyzed using linear regression, t-tests, and correlation analyses comparing child and adult waveforms.ResultsBoth onset and ACC responses were present across groups, with P1 latency decreasing significantly with age in NH and CI listeners. The ACC followed a similar developmental trajectory as the onset response but matured later, emerging reliably in adolescence. Noise delayed maturation, lengthened latencies, and reduced amplitudes, particularly for the ACC. CI users implanted before 3.5 years showed developmental patterns comparable to NH peers, though both onset and ACC responses were more affected by noise in CI users.Discussion/ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that early implantation supports the typical development of cortical auditory responses, underscoring the importance of neuroplasticity in pediatric CI users. However, the pronounced vulnerability of the ACC to noise highlights ongoing challenges in sound discrimination for CI users. CAEPs, especially ACC measures, may serve as objective markers of auditory maturation and could complement behavioral assessments in clinical practice.",

This is a Rust rewrite of the established Python tool <a href=\"https://pre-commit.com\">pre-commit</a>, which is widely used. Pre-commit is a great tool but it suffers from several limitations:</p> <ol> <li>Its pretty slow (although its surprisingly fast for being written in Python)</li> <li>The maintainer (<a href=\"https://github.com/asottile\">asottile</a>) made it very clear that he is not willing to introduce monorepo support or any other advanced features (e.g. parallelization) asked over the years</li> </ol> <p>I was following this project from its inception (whats now called Prek) and it evolved both very fast and very well. I am now using it across multiple project, e.g. in <a href=\"https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg\">Kreuzberg</a>, both locally and in CI and it does bring in an at least x10 speed improvement (linting and autoupdate commands!)</p> <p>So, I warmly recommend this tool, and do show your support for Prek by giving it a star!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Goldziher\"> /u/Goldziher </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1o77mip/recommending_prek_the_necessary_rust_rewrite_of/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1o77mip/recommending_prek_the_necessary_rust_rewrite_of/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Anomalous experiences are associated with high subconscious connectedness.",
    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "title": "When the unconscious contents are expressed in both Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS) and dreams: An experimental study.",
    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

    "content": "There are different perspectives on the psychological constructs of resilience and hypnotizability, and both are related to aspects of mental health. Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

However, research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy of acceptance, which may be related to instructions to accept different aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., thoughts vs. emotion). We compared the effects of self-regulation instructions to accept thoughts, emotions, or a combination of both on measures of affect (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, state anxiety) and emotional dysregulation immediately following emotion-eliciting film clips and following recovery periods after film clips. We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip.

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods.

Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "content": "ObjectiveEarly speech experiences are presumed to contribute to the development of brain structures involved in processing speech. Previous research has been limited to correlational studies. Here, we conducted a randomized trial with neonates born preterm to determine whether increased exposure to maternal speech during NICU hospitalization is causally linked to structural white matter maturation.Study designWe enrolled 46 neonates born preterm (24\u201331 weeks gestational age). Participants were randomly assigned to receive increased (T: n = 21) or routine (C: n = 25) exposure to mother\u2019s speech. The T-group heard 10-min audio recordings of their mothers reading a children\u2019s story two times/hour between 10pm and 6am, increasing speech exposure by 2.67 h/day. The C-group did not hear recorded speech. At near-term-equivalent age, we obtained two high-angular resolution diffusion MRI (scan 1: b = 700, scan 2: b = 1500) and T1 relaxometry scans. We assessed mean diffusivity (MD), pre-registered primary outcome (NCT02847689), of the left and right arcuate fasciculus, tracts implicated in language processing. Secondary outcomes included fractional anisotropy (FA) and R1 (1/T1). We hypothesized that neonates randomized to the T-group would show evidence for increased maturation within the arcuate, indexed as decreased MD and increased FA and R1, compared to neonates in the C-group.ResultsGroups were equivalent on medical and demographic variables. Linear mixed models demonstrated that compared to the C-group, the T-group demonstrated significantly lower MD in the left (scan 1: \u03b2 = \u22120.11, Marginal R2 = 0.27; scan 2: \u03b2 = \u22120.12, Marginal R2 = 0.33) but not right arcuate (scan 1: \u03b2 = \u22120.06, Marginal R2 = 0.09; scan 2: \u03b2 = \u22120.03, Marginal R2 = 0.01). The T-group also demonstrated significantly higher FA (scan 1 \u03b2 = 0.02, Marginal R2 = 0.20; scan 2: \u03b2 = 0.03, Marginal R2 = 0.31) and R1 (\u03b2 = 0.02, Marginal R2 = 0.39) in the left but not right arcuate.ConclusionPreterm neonates with increased maternal speech exposure showed more mature left arcuate microstructure, supporting a causal role of exposure to speech in brain development. Enhancing speech exposure in the NICU may benefit preterm children\u2019s language outcomes.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "title": "Pattern-Induced Visual Discomfort and Its Temporal Summation Revealed by Pupillary Measures",
    "content": "Viewing repetitive striped patterns can induce pattern glare, experienced as visual discomfort (VD). While previous studies examined either pupillary responses or VD separately, few have investigated how they covary or evolve with repeated exposure. This study tested whether pupillary dynamics could serve as an objective Aversometer - a physiological marker of individual visual sensitivity beyond subjective reports. Across four experiments (preliminary: n = 97; main: n = 70 for spatial frequency, n = 46 for central field size, n = 36 for central blank, with partial overlap), we manipulated spatial frequency, central field size, and surround field size of square-wave gratings (0.5-3 s) while measuring both discomfort and pupil size. Higher spatial frequencies and larger pattern areas elicited stronger pupillary constriction and greater discomfort, whereas repeated exposures produced cumulative increases in discomfort and decreases in baseline pupil size, consistent with visual strain rather than adaptation. To assess the potential of pupillometry as an aversometer, we examined individual differences in the main spatial-frequency experiment (controlled viewing distance, n = 42). A paradoxical pattern emerged: within participants, stronger stimuli produced greater constriction, but individuals with higher overall discomfort showed weaker constriction and stronger late redilation. Similar dissociations between subjective sensitivity and pupillary responses have been noted in studies of light-induced discomfort, suggesting that related mechanisms may contribute, although their specific physiological basis remains unclear. Overall, our findings clarify how pattern-induced discomfort evolves over time and across individuals and highlight pupillometry as a potential as a sensitive, objective tool for assessing visual sensitivity.",

    "content": "Objective. Analysis tools for peripheral nerve recordings remain underdeveloped compared to those for brain signals, limiting the advancement of nerve neurotechnologies for clinical treatments such as closed-loop systems. This study introduces and explores the performance of two novel nerve signal analysis techniques\u2014cross-correlation analysis and spike delay velocity analysis\u2014which rely on a defining feature of peripheral nerve signals: the reliable conduction velocity of signals transmitted by axons in nerves. Approach. We test the capabilities of the introduced cross-correlation and spike delay velocity analysis techniques both in silico on synthetic nerve signals and on in vivo nerve signals acquired from freely-moving rats. Main results. Our findings show that both techniques can be successfully employed to extract transmission direction and velocity information from compact two-electrode site peripheral nerve recording designs. Notably, cross-correlation analysis can be employed to detect neural signals of very low signal-to-noise ratio, otherwise undetectable by typical spike detection approaches. Significance. Our findings provide new techniques to both enhance detection and extract new information in the form of velocity data from nerve recordings using a compact two-electrode site recording setup. Unlike traditional methods, this design eliminates the need for long electrode arrays, making it particularly well-suited for use in freely-moving animal models and translational applications. As axon signal conduction direction and velocity are tightly linked to neural function, these techniques can support new research into peripheral nervous system function and new therapeutic approaches driven by neural interfaces.",

    "title": "BGTransform: a neurophysiologically informed EEG data augmentation framework",
    "content": "Objective. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for decoding electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) signals. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity and variability of available training data. Existing data augmentation methods often introduce signal distortions or lack physiological validity. This study proposes a novel augmentation strategy designed to improve generalization while preserving the underlying neurophysiological structure of EEG signals. Approach. We propose Background EEG Transform (BGTransform), a principled data augmentation framework that leverages the neurophysiological dissociation between task-related activity and ongoing background EEG. In contrast to existing methods, BGTransform generates new trials by selectively perturbing the background EEG component while preserving the task-related signal, thus enabling controlled variability without compromising class-discriminative features. We applied BGTransform to three publicly available EEG-BCI datasets spanning steady-state visual evoked potential and P300 paradigms. The effectiveness of BGTransform is evaluated using several widely adopted neural decoding models under three training regimes: (1) without augmentation (baseline model), (2) with conventional augmentation methods, and (3) with BGTransform. Main results. Across all datasets and model architectures, BGTransform consistently outperformed both baseline models and conventional augmentation techniques. Compared to models trained without BGTransform, it achieved average classification accuracy improvements of 2.45%\u201315.52%, 4.36%\u201317.15% and 7.55%\u201310.47% across the three datasets, respectively. In addition, BGTransform demonstrated greater robustness across subjects and tasks, maintaining stable performance under varying recording conditions. Significance. BGTransform provides a principled and effective approach to augmenting EEG data, informed by neurophysiological insight. By preserving task-related components and introducing controlled variability, the method addresses the challenge of data sparsity in EEG-BCI training. These findings support the utility of BGTransform for improving the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of deep learning models in neural engineering applications.",

    "content": "Objective. New implantable and wearable devices hold great promise to help patients manage their seizure disorders. One proposed application is measuring the rate of interictal epileptiform discharges as a biomarker of medication levels and seizure risk. This study aims to determine whether interictal epileptiform spike rates (spikes) are independently associated with anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels and evaluate whether spike rates are a reliable biomarker for ASM levels. Approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 69 patients with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring during ASM taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit. An automated spike detection algorithm, validated seizure annotations, and a model of ASM load were used to assess the relationship between spike rates, ASM level, state of consciousness, and seizure timing using linear mixed effects models. Event related analysis and seasonal autoregressive models were applied to evaluate both short-term and longer-term effects of ASMs on spike rates, respectively. Main Results. Spike rates were found to increase following seizures, during sleep, and in patients experiencing early seizures, with no significant association between ASM load and spike rates after controlling for these confounders. Initial models without controls showed a positive association between ASM load and spike rates. However, this relationship disappeared when the effects of sleep and seizures were accounted for. Medication-specific analysis revealed that only levetiracetam showed a significant impact on spike rates during taper. Significance. This study demonstrates that interictal spike rates are more strongly influenced by seizure activity and sleep than by ASM levels, suggesting limited utility of spike rates as a biomarker for ASM load. However, spikes may still serve as important markers for seizure control and disease severity.",

    "title": "Using economic value signals from primate prefrontal cortex in neuro-engineering applications",
    "content": "Objective. Brain\u2013machine interface (BMI) research has shown the efficacy of using motor and sensory-related neural signals to assist physically impaired patients. Despite the comparable ability to extract more abstract cognitive signals from the brain, little effort has been devoted to leveraging these signals in neuro-engineering applications. In this study, we explore the use of neural signals related to economic value, a key cognitive construct, in a BMI context. Approach. Using multivariate time series data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices in a value-based decision-making task. We implement a reinforcement learning-based training approach to develop adaptive decoders that can be extended to handle multi-step decisions, which frequently arise in real-world settings. Main results. We develop neural decoders leveraging subjective value signals to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices with accuracy on average, with above-chance accuracy even when choice options are objectively equal. We show that this same decoder architecture can be trained to execute choice-related actions and execute action sequences aligned with the user\u2019s goal. Finally, we explore a decoder architecture that uses a neural forecasting model equipped with task-related information, and show that it makes high accuracy predictions \u2009ms sooner than would otherwise be possible. Significance. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuro-engineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals to aid users in goal-directed behavior. They suggest that using abstract cognitive signals in real-world settings may be more accurate when combined with information from multiple sources, such as motor and sensory regions. This research also highlights the potential need for systems to measure their confidence in their actions when user input is minimal.",

    "content": "mRNA translational repression by eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and the formation of long-term memory (LTM). Among the three 4E-BP paralogs, 4E-BP2 is the predominant form expressed in neurons, and its full-body deletion in mice causes memory deficits. Mice lacking 4E-BP2 in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, but not excitatory neurons, display autistic-like behaviors and deficits in object location and recognition. The specific mRNAs translationally regulated by 4E-BP2 in GABAergic interneurons, and how they contribute to spatial and associative memory, are unknown. Here, we show that conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking 4E-BP2 selectively in GABAergic interneurons exhibit impairments in long-term spatial and contextual fear memory formation. We further demonstrate that 4E-BP2 deletion controls the translation of selective mRNAs in interneurons without increasing general protein synthesis. One of the mRNAs is Gal, which encodes a neuropeptide that modulates memory. Our findings provide evidence that 4E-BP2 selectively controls the translation of a subset of mRNAs in inhibitory neurons that are required for LTM formation.",

    "content": "The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is crucial for episodic memory, whereby posterior MTL preferentially represents visuospatial information, and anterior MTL is involved in the representation of semantic or conceptual information. The neurophysiological underpinnings of content-preferential organization in the developing MTL are largely unknown. Here we utilized rare electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from 23 pediatric epilepsy patients who completed a visual scene recognition memory task to systematically examine the neurophysiological underpinnings of memory formation along the MTL long axis. The timing of high-frequency activity (HFA, ~70-150 Hz) differed between the posterior and anterior MTL, peaking after scene onset in the posterior MTL and around scene category response (indoor/outdoor scene categorization) in the anterior MTL. Further, in the posterior MTL, HFA was predictive of successful memory formation and positively linked to memory performance, highlighting the importance of posterior MTL HFA to memory formation. In contrast, theta frequency in the anterior MTL was linked to memory performance, and theta-HFA phase-amplitude coupling before scene category responses was predictive of successful memory formation, highlighting the importance of anterior MTL theta oscillations to memory formation. Our findings establish distinct neurophysiological features along the posterior-to-anterior axis of the developing MTL that differentially support the representation of perceptual and conceptual information during memory formation.",

    "title": "Noradrenergic Modulation of an Amygdalo-thalamic Circuit",
    "content": "Emotional and cognitive processing rely on communication between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The BLA regulates mPFC both directly and indirectly via the medial sub-division of the medial dorsal thalamus (MDm). Although the BLA projection to MDm has been established anatomically, less is known about the functional properties of this synapse. Here, using patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics in ex vivo mouse brain slices, we found that BLA neurons make potent synaptic connections onto MDm neurons capable of evoking action potentials. The site of this BLA input overlaps with strong innervation from locus coeruleus norepinephrine (NE) axons. We found that NE acts via 2-adrenergic receptors to strongly reduce excitatory postsynaptic currents from BLA to MDm. NE also decreases the release probability of BLA axon terminals through a presynaptic mechanism. Postsynaptically, NE depolarizes MDm neurons and increases their tonic firing rates. These findings show that NE, whose levels are elevated during arousal and stress, can suppress transmission of affective information from BLA into MDm, thereby blunting this potent indirect pathway from BLA to mPFC.",

    "content": "Auditory externalization, the perception of a sound source as located outside the head, is essential for spatial hearing and auditory scene analysis. However, its neural correlates remain poorly understood. This study investigated differences in brain activation elicited by externalized versus internalized sound sources. Twenty-nine healthy participants underwent a 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while listening to auditory stimuli presented in three spatialization conditions: reverberant externalized sounds (highest externalization), anechoic externalized sounds (intermediate externalization) and diotic anechoic sounds (internalized). Whole-brain analyses revealed greater activation for externalized compared to internalized sound sources in the left superior temporal gyrus, including the planum temporale, the cerebellum and the left posterior cingulate gyrus. Internalized sounds elicited greater relative activity in the left inferior temporal gyrus. Direct comparison between the two externalized conditions revealed stronger left superior temporal gyrus activation for reverberant sounds, while anechoic sounds preferentially activated the right middle temporal gyrus. These findings confirmed the key role of the planum temporale in auditory externalization and the involvement of higher-order brain regions, suggesting broader networks underpinning the perception of sound location.",

    "title": "Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials reflects trait anxiety and harm avoidance in healthy adults: an exploratory study",
    "content": "Loudness dependence of auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP), a neurophysiological measure that reflects central serotonergic activity, is also influenced by the noradrenaline and dopamine systems. While it has been used in investigations of various psychiatric disorders, the fundamental characteristics in healthy individuals remain largely unknown. The present exploratory study examined 60 healthy adults to determine the associations of LDAEP with psychological traits assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The participants completed TCI and STAI questionnaires before undergoing electrophysiological recordings. LDAEP was measured based on the peak-to-peak amplitude slopes of P50/N100 and N100/P200 across five sound intensity levels. Using Spearman's correlation analysis, moderate negative correlations of LDAEP slopes with harm avoidance (HA) and trait anxiety (STAI-T) scores were noted. Additionally, sex-adjusted analysis showed novelty seeking to be positively associated with LDAEP. These findings suggest an association of LDAEP with individual differences in harm avoidance, trait anxiety, and novelty seeking in healthy adults. This supports the potential use of LDAEP as a non-invasive biomarker to predict treatment response in major depressive disorder, as well as in anxiety-related conditions.",

    "content": "IntroductionPerinatal brain injury is a leading cause of cerebral palsy. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) provides a non-invasive method for investigating motor pathway development; however, data on the safety and feasibility of its repeated use in infants are limited. This study provides the first longitudinal evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of spTMS in infants with perinatal brain injury.MethodsTwenty infants with perinatal brain injury (corrected age 3\u201325 months) participated in 46 spTMS sessions while awake. Safety and tolerability were systematically assessed using heart rate, respiratory rate, and the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS). Feasibility was quantified by session completion, participant retention, and acquisition of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from bilateral wrist flexors.ResultsAcross 2,527 pulses, no adverse events occurred. Physiological measures and MBPS scores remained stable from pre- to post-stimulation. Analyzable electromyography (EMG) was obtained in 100% of sessions, with MEPs successfully elicited in 44/46 sessions (95.7%) across 19/20 infants (95%). A high longitudinal retention rate (85%) further demonstrated excellent protocol acceptability.DiscussionThese findings establish a safe, reproducible framework for longitudinal spTMS in a vulnerable infant population. This methodological advance enables future investigations into neuroplasticity and corticospinal tract development after early brain injury, with the potential to yield biomarkers that guide the timing and targets of early interventions.",

    "title": "Brainstem neurochemical profiles after hospitalisation for COVID-19: a 7T MR spectroscopy study",
    "content": "BackgroundSomatic, cognitive and mental health issues have been identified in three-quarters of people 5\u202fmonths after hospitalisation for severe acute SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. The underlying neuroanatomical basis of these symptoms remains unclear, but recent studies suggest a role for altered brainstem physiology. We aimed to test the hypothesis that brainstem neurochemical profiles differ in patients who had been hospitalised for COVID-19 compared to matched controls using 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).MethodsThis prospective case\u2013control study recruited 34 individuals who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and 15 healthy controls with no history of COVID-19 infection from two major UK hospitals before vaccines became available. The participants underwent 7T semi-adiabatic localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (sLASER) 1H-MRS at the ponto-medullary junction. Water-referenced metabolite concentrations were compared between the patients and controls and correlated with infection severity, as measured by maximum C-reactive protein (CRPmax) assay during inpatient admission. Linear mixed modelling was used with a 0.05 significance level.ResultsSpectral quality was high/acceptable in 44/49 participants according to the MRS Consensus criteria. The magnitude of inflammation during patient admission (i.e., CRPmax) correlated positively with myo-inositol concentration (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.005, p\u202f=\u202f0.035), as did patient-reported symptoms (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.564, p\u202f=\u202f0.023). However, metabolite concentrations were not significantly different between the patients and controls.ConclusionWe show the feasibility of assessing brainstem neurochemical profiles using 7T 1H-MRS in a multi-centre study. Technical limitations at one site\u2019s 7T MRI led to variable repetition times, which limited our statistical power and should be avoided in future studies. Our findings highlight the need for further investigation into the role of neuroinflammation in post-acute COVID-19.",

    "content": "Background/objectivesThe pupil, a dynamic ocular structure, serves as a critical indicator of neurological and ophthalmological function. This interdisciplinary review explores the anatomical, physiological, and pathological aspects of pupillary reflexes and disorders.ContentEmphasis is placed on the diagnostic relevance of light and accommodation reflexes, sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, and the clinical implications of conditions such as Horner\u2019s syndrome, Adie\u2019s tonic pupil, and Argyll Robertson pupil. The utility of pharmacological testing and pupillometry in localizing lesions and identifying subclinical changes is extensively discussed. Advancements in pupillary assessment\u2013particularly dynamic and chromatic pupillometry\u2013offer novel insights into autonomic nervous system dysfunction, neurodegenerative diseases, and retinal pathologies including glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa.Recent findingsBy integrating classical examination techniques with modern imaging and measurement modalities, the pupil emerges as a valuable biomarker in systemic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. This review underscores the necessity of collaborative, multidisciplinary approaches for accurate diagnosis and effective management of pupillary abnormalities.ConclusionParticular attention is given to the diagnostic and prognostic applications of pupillometry, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pupillary abnormalities, and the utility of pharmacological tests in lesion localization. By consolidating foundational knowledge with recent clinical and technological developments, this review offers an updated framework for understanding pupillary function and dysfunction and highlights the importance of collaborative approaches across medical specialties for improved diagnostic accuracy and patient care.",

    "title": "Endovascular management of tandem embolic stroke due to cardioembolic free-floating thrombus: a case report",
    "content": "BackgroundTandem lesions (TLs), defined as simultaneous occlusions of both extracranial and intracranial arteries, represent a particularly challenging subset of large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes. While most TLs are attributed to atherosclerotic changes or arterial dissection, a smaller subset originates from cardioembolic emboli arising from the heart or aortic arch, commonly referred to as embolic tandem lesions. In rare instances, these emboli form a free-floating thrombus (FFT) in the carotid artery, characterized by mobile intraluminal thrombotic material with high embolic potential. Optimal treatment strategies for these rare and complex cases remain undefined.Case summaryWe present a rare case involving an embolic tandem lesion in a 73-year-old male with known atrial fibrillation who presented with acute ischemic stroke upon awakening. Imaging and angiography demonstrated a free-floating thrombus (FFT) at the brachiocephalic bifurcation extending into the origins of the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries, a free-floating thrombus at the carotid bifurcation, and an additional thrombus occluding the right ICA terminus and the origin of the M1 segment. A staged endovascular approach was employed: intracranial recanalization was first achieved via mechanical thrombectomy, followed by stent-assisted stabilization of the residual free-floating thrombus within the common carotid artery. The patient experienced significant neurological improvement and attained functional independence at 3-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic complexity associated with embolic tandem lesions and carotid FFT involvement. Comprehensive preprocedural imaging, including assessment of the aortic arch and cervical vessels, is critical. A personalized, multi-modality endovascular approach combining thrombectomy and stenting can enable successful revascularization and favorable clinical outcomes, particularly when FFT complicates tandem occlusions.",

    "content": "When beliefs in autobiographical memories are reduced while recollections remain relatively intact, a phenomenon termed nonbelieved memories (NBMs) unfolds. The current preregistered study (<em>N</em> = 104) used a 3-week longitudinal design to investigate the relationships between the frequency of recalled NBMs, memory distrust, rumination over autobiographical events, and self-esteem. Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Dissociation is a phenomenon present in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders as well as in the general population. The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: Developmental dyslexia (DD) has been related to deficits in multiple cognitive skills. Phonological processing deficits are the most frequently reported in opaque orthographies, but there are few studies of transparent orthographies, such as Spanish. The aim of this study was to comprehensively explore possible deficiencies in cognitive functions in Spanish-speaking Mexican children with DD, to determine whether these deficits can explain problems with decoding fluency and accuracy, and analyze whether they provide support for some of the explanatory hypotheses of DD. Method: An extensive cognitive assessment was performed with Spanish-speaking readers: 40 children (20 girls) with DD (mean age 9.02 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.49) and 40 children (20 girls) who were typical readers (mean age 9.22 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.45). Results: Our results showed that most of the children with DD presented deficits in multiple cognitive skills, although not all of these skills contributed to reading performance. These cognitive deficits were not equally distributed among all children and there was no cognitive skill in which all participants with DD showed poor performance. Our results demonstrated that recognition of letter orientation, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming were significant predictors of reading ability. Conclusion: These findings support the idea that reading is a multifactorial process involving many cognitive skills, and its disruption could arise from different causes. The main findings are discussed in relation to the major explanatory hypotheses of DD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic condition with implications on cognitive functions such as decision-making and impulse control. Intertemporal choice paradigms, measuring temporal discounting, offer insight into decision-making of addictive behaviors. When coupled with mouse kinematics, they also provide implicit measures of decision dynamics. Here, we employed mouse kinematics to investigate the profile of both explicit and implicit intertemporal decision-making in CUD patients versus healthy controls, and the degree of association with clinical, psychiatric, and neuropsychological measures. Method: We recorded mouse kinematics during an intertemporal choice task in 36 CUD patients and 34 healthy matched controls. Before testing, CUD patients underwent a general assessment on a set of addiction-related psychiatric and cognitive domains. Results: In line with previous literature, results revealed higher discount rates in the CUD group. Mouse kinematics was able to discriminate among groups, with CUD patients displaying straighter trajectories for immediate choices and edge-curved ones for future ones. Further, a series of significant correlations have been found between discount rates, kinematic measures and both clinical and psychiatric indices. Conclusions: Overall, these results hold important implications and relevant insights for tailored therapeutic interventions, relapses prediction, and neurobiological classification of addictive disorders.

    "title": "Anhedonia is associated with impaired memory for positive emotional stimuli in individuals with schizophrenia.",
    "content": "Objective: Individuals with psychotic disorders routinely display anhedonia when rated on clinical interviews that rely on retrospective reports of pleasure; however, hedonic response is intact on laboratory paradigms measuring self-reported in-the-moment (i.e., consummatory) pleasure. It is currently unclear how to reconcile this apparent discrepancy. In the present study, we examined the possibility that clinician-rated anhedonia is associated with impaired memory for positive information across two experiments. Method: In Experiment 1, individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ; <em>n</em> = 28) and healthy controls (CN: <em>n</em> = 21) completed valence and arousal ratings of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral photograph stimuli, followed by an unprompted recognition test after a 1-week delay. In Experiment 2, individuals with SZ (<em>n</em> = 102) and CN (<em>n</em> = 60) completed the Emotional Verbal Learning Test, which assesses memory for word stimuli from happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety conditions over five immediate free-recall trials, short-delay free recall, 20-min long-delay free recall, and long-delay yes/no recognition conditions. Results: Results of Experiment 1 indicated that SZ and CN reported similar levels of valence and arousal to visual stimuli; however, SZ had poorer recognition memory for both pleasant and unpleasant stimuli compared with CN. In Experiment 2, CN demonstrated preferential recall for happiness over sadness, anger, and anxiety stimuli. However, this preferential recall advantage for happiness stimuli was less evident in SZ. Conclusions: Across both studies, reduced recall or recognition for positive stimuli was associated with greater severity of anhedonia. Collectively, findings from these two experiments suggest that clinical ratings of anhedonia are associated with memory deficits for positive stimuli in SZ.

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
    "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "The circadian system regulates core physiological processes, including muscle regeneration, protein synthesis, and cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in circadian rhythms contribute to impaired muscle function in older adults, with age-related declines in muscle mass and regenerative capacity serving as major contributors to sarcopenia. Emerging evidence indicates that exercise\u2014a powerful modulator of muscle adaptation\u2014can also influence circadian regulation, offering a potential avenue to enhance muscle repair in aging populations. This review examines how physical activity interacts with circadian mechanisms in aged skeletal muscle, emphasizing key molecular and cellular pathways involved in muscle regeneration. Central circadian regulators such as Clock, BMAL1, and PER1 are discussed in the context of muscle protein turnover, satellite cell activity, and mitochondrial function. Aligning exercise timing with circadian rhythms is proposed as a promising strategy to enhance muscle recovery and functional capacity in older individuals. Furthermore, the review highlights the therapeutic potential of chrono-exercise to delay the onset of sarcopenia and promote healthy aging. By integrating insights from chronobiology, geroscience, and exercise physiology, this analysis underscores the importance of chrono-exercise in supporting muscle health during aging.",

    "content": "ObjectivePost-stroke depression (PSD), a common neuropsychiatric complication, significantly hinders stroke recovery and quality of life. Given the established role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PSD, this study aimed to identify key inflammation-related genes and pathways using bioinformatics and machine learning and further evaluate the protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) monomer compounds.MethodsPSD-related datasets (GSE16561, GSE98793) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package, followed by functional enrichment analysis with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Three machine learning algorithms\u2014random forest, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)\u2014were applied to screen inflammation-related hub genes. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Candidate TCM compounds were explored via the Coremine Medical database. A PSD rat model was established to validate hub gene expression and to assess the efficacy of berberine (BBR).ResultsAnalysis identified 35 inflammation-related DEGs (IDEGs) significantly enriched in immunological processes, including malaria pathogenesis, NETosis, innate immune deficiencies, Rap1 signaling, and IL-17 cascades. The integration of machine learning pinpointed TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core hub genes, demonstrating robust diagnostic performance in external validation. Molecular docking suggested a strong binding affinity between the TCM compound BBR and TLR2/CYP1B1 proteins. PSD rats exhibited prolonged immobility in forced swim/tail suspension tests and decreased sucrose preference versus controls, alongside neuronal damage, edema, and inflammatory infiltration (HE staining). BBR treatment reversed these behavioral deficits and pathological changes. Western blot analysis confirmed elevated TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression in PSD rats, significantly downregulated by BBR. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed increased serum IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels in PSD, which BBR effectively reduced.ConclusionThis study identifies TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core inflammation-related genes in PSD. BBR demonstrates therapeutic efficacy as an active monomer compound against PSD, likely mediated through downregulating TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression, consequently diminishing the concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) that mediate cerebroprotective actions.",

    "content": "BackgroundElectroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to assess prognosis in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). Visual assessments by physicians and quantitative EEG (qEEG) are commonly used; however, only a few studies have directly compared their predictive accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the prognostic value of visual EEG classification versus that of qEEG-based spectral analysis for survival and neurological outcomes in patients with impaired consciousness.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we examined 97 patients with impaired consciousness admitted to the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Fukushima Medical University Hospital between April 2018 and December 2023. Visual EEG grading was performed using a conventional grading system based on established criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare predictive performance. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed incorporating qEEG and clinical prognostic factors (Scarpino score, rehabilitation status, and age). The incremental predictive value of clinical variables was assessed using DeLong\u2019s test.ResultsVisual EEG assessment showed moderate predictive accuracy [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.77 for survival; 0.677\u20130.725 for neurological outcomes]. qEEG-based models showed comparable performance to visual EEG classification, with slightly higher AUC values that were not statistically significant. The addition of clinical factors significantly improved predictive accuracy, particularly for neurological recovery (AUC improved from 0.729 to 0.936; P < 0.001).ConclusionCombining qEEG features and clinical prognostic factors provided a comprehensive approach for outcome prediction in patients with DoC. These findings support the potential of a multimodal prognostic framework integrating objective EEG metrics and physician-derived evaluations, although further prospective validation is required.",

    "content": "ObjectivesMutations in KIDINS220 are known to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and SINO syndrome. However, the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of KIDINS220-related disorders remains incompletely understood. Herein, we describe the clinical, electrophysiological, histopathological, and genetic features of a novel KIDINS220 sterile alpha motif (SAM) -like domain mutation identified in a Chinese family with HSP accompanied by severe peripheral neuropathy (PN).MethodsClinical data, electrophysiological characteristics, and sural nerve histopathology were analyzed in a 19-year-old Chinese male. Genetic testing was performed in his family by using whole-exome sequencing, mitochondrial genome testing, and Sanger validation. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to analyze the phenotypic and genetic data of previously reported cases with KIDINS220 variants up to July 2025.ResultsThe proband exhibited classical signs of autosomal dominant HSP accompanied by severe multifocal sensory-motor PN. The spinal cord MRI showed mild spinal cord thinning, while the brain MRI and nerve ultrasound examinations were normal. Electrophysiological study revealed absent sensory nerve responses and globally reduced motor conduction velocities. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed significantly reduced nerve fiber density, myelin defects, axonal degeneration, and mitochondrial abnormalities. A heterozygous KIDINS220 c.3668A > G (p. Glu1223Gly) mutation, located within the SAM domain, was identified in both the proband and his mother. A total of 42 cases from 11 cohorts were reviewed.ConclusionWe suggest that patients with KIDINS220 SAM domain mutation may present with HSP accompanied by severe, mixed axonal and demyelinating PN, expanding the existing spectrum of the clinical phenotypes and pathogenic variants of KIDINS220.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.12146v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The paper presents a comparative user study between an Augmented Reality-based Computer-Aided Design (AR-CAD) system and a traditional computer-based CAD modeling software, SolidWorks. Twenty participants of varying skill levels performed 3D modeling tasks using both systems. The results showed that while the average task completion time is comparable for both groups, novice designers had a higher completion rate in AR-CAD than in the traditional CAD interface, and experienced designers had a similar completion rate in both systems. A statistical comparison of task completion rate, time, and NASA Task Load Index (TLX) showed that AR-CAD slightly reduced cognitive load while favoring a high task completion rate. Higher scores on the System Usability Scale (SUS) by novices indicated that AR-CAD was superior and worthwhile for reducing barriers to entering CAD. In contrast, the Traditional CAD interface was favored by experienced users for its advanced capabilities, while many viewed AR-CAD as a valid means for rapid concept development, education, and an initial critique of designs. This opens up the need for future research on the needed refinement of AR-CAD with a focus on high-precision input tools and its evaluation of complex design processes. This research highlights the potential for immersive interfaces to enhance design practice, bridging the gap between novice and experienced CAD users.",

Yet, timelines -- a fundamental tool for representing historical and conceptual development -- remain largely static, limiting user agency and curiosity. We introduce the concept of a generative timeline: an AI-powered timeline that adapts to users' evolving questions by expanding or contracting in response to input. We instantiate this concept through KnowledgeTrail, a system that enables users to co-construct timelines of historical events and knowledge formation processes. Two user studies showed that KnowledgeTrail fosters curiosity-driven exploration, serendipitous discovery, and the ability to trace complex relationships between ideas and events, while citation features supported verification yet revealed fragile trust shaped by perceptions of source credibility. We contribute a vision for generative timelines as a new class of exploratory interface, along with design insights for balancing serendipity and credibility.",

    "title": "Social Simulation for Integrating Self-Care: Measuring the Effects of Contextual Environments in Augmented Reality for Mental Health Practice",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.12081v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite growing interest in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) for mental well-being, prior work using immersive interventions to teach mental health skills has largely focused on calming or abstract settings. As a result, little is known about how realistic social simulation may better support the transfer and application of skills to in-person environments. In this work, we present a 14-day user study with 43-participants comparing an augmented reality intervention simulating a realistic contextual environment against a matched non-contextual control, applied to the public speaking context. We found that participants who practice mental health skills in the contextual environment showed significantly greater likelihood to apply self-care techniques and greater physiological stress reduction when using skills in mock in-person tasks. Overall, our work provides empirical evidence for the effects of realistic stressor simulation, and offers design implications for mental health technology that supports effective transfer of skills to the real-world.",

We detail the algorithms used to implement the optional block feature and present usage experiences from instructors who have integrated it into their curriculum. The optional blocks feature enables instructors to create more complex Parsons problems with multiple correct solutions utilizing omitted or optional blocks. This affords students a method to engage with questions that have several valid solutions composed of different answer components. Instructors can specify blocks with multiple mutually exclusive dependencies, which we represent using a multigraph structure. This multigraph is then collapsed into multiple directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), allowing us to reuse existing algorithms for grading block ordering problems represented as a DAG. We present potential use cases for this feature across various domains, including helping students learn Git workflows, shell command sequences, mathematical proofs, and Python programming concepts.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.11954v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Enterprise chatbots show promise in supporting knowledge workers in information synthesis tasks by retrieving context from large, heterogeneous databases before generating answers. However, when the retrieved context misaligns with user intentions, the chatbot often produces \"irrelevantly right\" responses that provide little value. In this work, we introduce VizCopilot, a prototype that incorporates visualization techniques to actively involve end-users in context alignment. By combining topic modeling with document visualization, VizCopilot enables human oversight and modification of retrieved context while keeping cognitive overhead manageable. We used VizCopilot as a design probe in a Research-through-Design study to evaluate the role of visualization in context alignment and to surface future design opportunities. Our findings show that visualization not only helps users detect and correct misaligned context but also encourages them to adapt their prompting strategies, enabling the system to retrieve more relevant context from the outset. At the same time, the study reveals limitations in verification support regarding close-reading and trust in AI summaries. We outline future directions for visualization-enhanced chatbots, focusing on personalization, proactivity, and sustainable human-AI collaboration.",

Alterations can enable small changes to otherwise static garments, but these changes often require sewing and are non-reversible. We propose a modular approach to garment design that considers resizing, restyling, and reuse earlier in the design process. Our contributions include a compact set of modules and connectors that form the building blocks of modular garments, a method to decompose a garment into modules via integer linear programming, and a digital design tool that supports modular garment design and simulation. Our user evaluation suggests that our approach to modular design can support the creation of a wide range of garments and can help users transform them across sizes and styles while reusing the same building blocks.",

However, not every potentially important feature in the data may correspond to a visual feature which readers can detect or prioritize. In this study, we conducted a visual stenography task, where participants re-drew line charts to solicit information about the visual features they believed to be important. We systematically varied noise levels (SNR ~5-30 dB) across line charts to observe how visual clutter influences which features people prioritize in their sketches. We identified three key strategies that correlated with the noise present in the stimuli: the Replicator attempted to retain all major features of the line chart including noise; the Trend Keeper prioritized trends disregarding periodicity and peaks; and the De-noiser filtered out noise while preserving other features. Further, we found that participants tended to faithfully retain trends and peaks and valleys when these features were present, while periodicity and noise were represented in more qualitative or gestural ways: semantically rather than accurately. These results suggest a need to consider more flexible and human-centric ways of presenting, summarizing, pre-processing, or clustering time series data.",

Our study highlights the advantages of each annotator population and the impact of the different feedback loops; a closer loop creates higher quality conversations with a decrease in quantity and diversity.

This limitation arises primarily from the lack of personalization and adaptive content design. To address this, we propose MindfulVerse, an AI-Generated Content (AIGC)-driven application to create personalized and immersive mindfulness experiences. By developing a novel agent, the system can dynamically adjust the meditation content based on the ideas of individual users. Furthermore, we conducted exploratory user studies and comparative evaluations to assess the application scenarios and performance of our novel generative meditation tool in VR environments. The results of this user study indicate that generative meditation improves neural activation in self-regulation and shows a positive impact on emotional regulation and participation. Our approach offers a generative meditation procedure that provides users with an application that better suits their preferences and states.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \\emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \\emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\\varnothing$, i.e., \\[ \\Delta = K\\big(O_{W,\\varnothing}\\big) - K\\big(O_{W,R}\\big) > 0. \\] We then prove that the larger $\\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\\Delta > 0$ yields \\[ \\Pr\\big((W,R)\\mid x\\big) \\le C\\,2^{\\,M(W{:}R)}\\,2^{-\\Delta}, \\] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \\emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \\emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \\emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.12751v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Background: Non-linear alterations in brain network connectivity may represent early neural signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in cognitively normal older adults. Understanding these changes and their cognitive relevance could provide sensitive biomarkers for early detection. Most prior studies recruited participants from memory clinics, often with subjective memory concerns, limiting generalizability.\n  Methods: We examined 14 large-scale functional brain networks in 968 cognitively normal older adults recruited from the community using resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (amyloid-$\\beta$ 1-42 [A$\\beta$], total tau, phosphorylated tau 181), and neuropsychological assessments. Functional networks were identified using group independent component analysis.\n  Results: Inverted U-shaped associations between CSF A$\\beta$ and functional connectivity were observed in the precuneus network and ventral default mode network (DMN), but not in the dorsal DMN, indicating network-specific vulnerability to early amyloid pathology. Higher connectivity in A$\\beta$-related networks, including dorsal and ventral DMN, precuneus, and posterior salience networks, was associated with better visual memory, visuospatial, and executive performance. No significant relationships were observed between CSF tau and functional connectivity.\n  Conclusions: Using a large, community-based cohort, we demonstrate that non-linear alterations in functional connectivity occur in specific networks even during the asymptomatic phase of AD. Moreover, A$\\beta$-related network connectivity is cognitively relevant, highlighting functional brain networks as promising imaging markers for early detection and prognosis of AD.",

However, this causal view fails to explain misrepresentation, a phenomenon better handled by an informational view based on decodable content. This creates a tension: how does a system that abstracts away details still preserve the fine-grained information needed for downstream functions? We propose readout representation to resolve this, defining representation by the information recoverable from features rather than their causal origin. Empirically, we show that inputs can be accurately reconstructed even from heavily perturbed mid-level features, demonstrating that a single input corresponds to a broad, redundant region of feature space, challenging the causal mapping perspective. To quantify this property, we introduce representation size, a metric linked to model robustness and representational redundancy. Our framework offers a new lens for analyzing how both biological and artificial neural systems learn complex features while maintaining robust, information-rich representations of the world.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.12141v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision. MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.",

While such analyses are possible when areas are recorded simultaneously, it is rare to observe all combinations of areas of interest within a single animal or recording session. How can we leverage multi-animal datasets to better understand multi-area interactions? Building on recent progress in large-scale, multi-animal models, we introduce NeuroPaint, a masked autoencoding approach for inferring the dynamics of unrecorded brain areas. By training across animals with overlapping subsets of recorded areas, NeuroPaint learns to reconstruct activity in missing areas based on shared structure across individuals. We train and evaluate our approach on synthetic data and two multi-animal, multi-area Neuropixels datasets. Our results demonstrate that models trained across animals with partial observations can successfully in-paint the dynamics of unrecorded areas, enabling multi-area analyses that transcend the limitations of any single experiment.",

    "title": "A reference brain for the clonal raider ant",
    "content": "Ants exhibit remarkable collective and social behaviors, such as alloparental care, chemical communication, homing, and cooperative group hygiene. The clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi is especially well-suited for investigating the neuronal and genetic underpinnings of these behaviors. Unlike most ant species, O. biroi lacks a queen caste. Instead, colonies consist entirely of regular workers and slightly larger intercaste workers. All workers reproduce in synchrony via parthenogenesis, giving rise to age-matched cohorts of clonally identical offspring. This unique life history enables precise experimental control over age, genotype, and colony composition. These features have also facilitated the introduction of genetically encoded calcium indicators into O. biroi, enabling in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the neural basis of social behaviors. Despite its promise as a neuroscience model, the structure of the clonal raider ant brain has not been systematically characterized, and a representative reference brain does not exist. To address this gap, we imaged the brains of 40 age-matched, genetically identical individuals with confocal microscopy and, using 3D groupwise registration, generated the first reference brain for the species. We introduce a registration pipeline to align brains to this reference, facilitating the comparison of anatomical features across labeling experiments with high spatial precision. Unexpectedly, despite homogeneity in genotype, age, and external morphology, we discovered extensive interindividual variability across our collection of brain samples. This raises the possibility that behavioral division of labor in O. biroi is linked to individual differences in brain structure. This work provides a powerful resource for the emerging clonal raider ant neuroscience community and reveals novel features of the species' neurobiology that may influence social behaviors and colony function.",

    "title": "Patterns of Brain Activation and Hippocampal Functional Connectivity Supporting Verbal Memory in Midlife Women",
    "content": "Women show declines in verbal memory across the menopause transition that may persist into the postmenopause. The goal of the present study was to characterize the patterns of brain activity and hippocampal functional connectivity that support verbal memory performance in midlife postmenopausal women. The study sample included 171 midlife postmenopausal women from the MsBrain I study (mean age = 59.3 years, mean education= 15.7 years, 87.7% white). All participants were cognitively normal, native English speakers, not taking menopausal hormone therapy. Participants completed neuropsychological (California Verbal Learning Test [CVLT]) and neuroimaging assessments, including an fMRI task of verbal encoding and recognition. Findings indicated that during verbal encoding, greater activation of bilateral prefrontal and medial temporal regions, as well as the precuneus, cuneus, caudate, and cerebellar regions, was associated with better performance on CVLT measures, including learning, short- and long-delay recall, and semantic clustering. Functional connectivity from both hippocampi to primarily right prefrontal regions during verbal encoding associated with better CVLT performance. In-scanner word recognition accuracy was more strongly associated with activation of parietal and occipital regions, and with functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and bilateral parietal and temporal regions. Our findings characterize the patterns underlying verbal memory abilities in midlife postmenopausal women. The patterns identified here may act as a foundation for better interpreting the effects of hormonal changes and menopausal symptoms on cognition at midlife, and for identifying neural targets for pharmacological and lifestyle interventions aimed at sustaining women's memory function.",

    "title": "Single cell transcriptomics reveals enrichment of aggregation-prone alpha-synuclein isoforms across synucleinopathies",
    "content": "Alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Dysregulated expression of its encoding gene, SNCA, has been identified in association with both PD and DLB in short-read sequencing studies. However, such studies do not capture variation in transcript isoforms expressed. Here we combine for the first time SNCA-targeted long-read multiplexed arrays isoform sequencing (MAS-Iso-seq) with unbiased short-read single nucleus (sn) RNA-seq for simultaneous characterization of the SNCA transcript isoform landscape and mapping of isoform expression to specific cell types and subtypes in PD, DLB, and control sample cortical tissues. This approach enabled discovery of numerous SNCA transcript isoforms displaying novel splicing patterns and incorporating novel exons. We further identified an abundant class of transcript isoforms encoding a previously unreported a-Syn protein variant (a-Syn-115) and displaying increased proportional detection in excitatory neurons of PD and DLB tissues in comparison to controls. The proportion of these isoforms was found to be especially high within several specific glutamatergic neuron subtypes. In-depth characterization of the predicted structural and biochemical properties of a-Syn-115 using an in silico modeling approach revealed a greater aggregative affinity compared with canonical a-Syn-140, suggesting the potential for increased cytosolic a-Syn-115 abundance to induce aggregation between heterogeneous a-Syn isoforms, potentially driving fibril formation and disease progression. Together, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying a-Syn involvement in multiple synucleinopathies and have translational implications for the development of new precision medicine strategies to combat these diseases, indicating the potential for treatments targeting both specific transcript and protein isoforms, as well as disease-driving cell subtypes.",

    "title": "Harry Potter meets Markov: Neural event representation in the reading network during narrative processing",
    "content": "People segment ongoing information into meaningful mental representations known as events. Recent studies have found a spatio-temporal hierarchy in the event structure during movie watching and story listening. How the human brain segments stories while reading remains unclear. We examined event segmentation while reading Harry Potter using publicly available 3T fMRI data. To identify neural events, we employed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) within six regions of interest (ROI) in the reading network. The ROIs included the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), angular gyrus (AG), inferior frontal gyrus orbital (IFGorb), anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and posterior temporal lobe (PTL). These regions are also associated with DMN. The results revealed multiple timescales of events, with the IFG and AG representing shorter events, while the IFGorb, ATL, PTL and MFG represent relatively longer events. Boundaries of longer events were partially aligned within short events, suggesting a nested hierarchical event structure. Further comparisons identified associations between neural events and annotations from humans and ChatGPT (automated and less subjective segmentation) in the inferior frontal, temporal and parietal areas. Notably, the AG (a core region of the DMN and memory processing) and the IFG (relevant for language processing) exhibited stronger alignment with both sets of annotations. The findings suggest an important role of AG and IFG in event segmentation in reading. They also confirm the connection between the reading network and the DMN in event segmentation. This connection seems to be linked to the hierarchical processing of context-dependent semantic information during reading.",

    "title": "Transposable Element-Mediated Epigenomic Remodeling Drives Erythropoietin-Induced Neurogenesis in the Adult Hippocampus",
    "content": "Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which erythropoietin (EPO) is associated with neurogenesis is essential to harness its therapeutic potential for cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we employed single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq), combined with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), to map the epigenomic and transcriptional landscapes of adult mouse hippocampus under recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) treatment. We discovered significant lineage-specific remodelling of chromatin accessibility predominantly in newly formed pyramidal neurons, highlighting a robust EPO-driven neurogenic response. Notably, transposable elements (TEs), particularly ancient LINEs and SINEs, emerged as critical cis-regulatory elements extensively bound by key neurogenic transcription factors such as NEUROD1/2, FOXG1, and ASCL1. Integrative analyses revealed that these TE-derived regulatory elements orchestrate gene networks involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognised role of TEs as dynamic regulators in EPO-induced hippocampal re-wiring of gene regulatory networks associated with neurogenesis, establishing a valuable epigenomic resource for advancing therapeutic strategies targeting cognitive deficits and neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "title": "Towards decoding inner speech from EEG and MEG",
    "content": "Despite the prevalence of inner speech in everyday life, research on this has been limited, particularly when it comes to non-invasive methods. This preprint aims to fill this gap by using EEG and MEG to collect data from three different inner speech paradigms, and by conducting an initial decoding analysis. Specifically, we tested silent reading, repetitive inner speech, and generative inner speech tasks. We collect a high number of inner speech trials from a few participants. Besides comparing across recording modalities we also compare across inner speech types. Our aim is to analyse the decodability of inner speech within each task and between tasks by the use of transfer learning. We find that in both EEG and MEG, silent reading can be decoded relatively well with 30-40% accuracy across 5 words. However, the decoding performance of both types of inner speech is mostly at chance level. This prohibited further transfer learning investigations between tasks. While the inner speech results are primarily negative, we believe our exploration of data size and various decoding methods is valuable. The dataset itself is useful for the research community as it contains a much larger number of trials within one participant than any other inner speech dataset. Having multiple sessions also allows for testing across-session performance. Finally, we systematically compare silent reading decoding performance within 3 participants across four non-invasive modalities. These are EEG, 2 types of MEG machines, Elekta and CTF, and optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs). We also compare the spatiotemporal dynamics of silent reading between these modalities. This is especially aimed at validating OPMs as a new kind of non-invasive brain recording technology. We find comparable performance to EEG, but OPM performance did not reach traditional MEG.",

    "title": "PERINATAL ORGANOPHOSPHATE FLAME RETARDANT EXPOSURE ALTERS ADULT HPA AXIS FUNCTION AND AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR IN A SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER IN MICE",
    "content": "Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are ubiquitous flame-retardant additives with endocrine-disrupting properties. Despite increasing evidence that OPFRs impact neurodevelopment, their effects on the neuroendocrine stress response remain poorly understood. To examine their long-term impact on stress regulation, we treated pregnant C57Bl/6J dams to a mixture of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and tricresyl phosphate (TCP; 1 mg/kg each) from gestational day (GD) 7 through postnatal day (PND) 14. Adult offspring (8-9 weeks of age) were then challenged with acute stressors, including 1 h restraint or a 6-day acute variable stress (AVS) paradigm. Perinatal OPFR exposure produced persistent, sex-specific alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stress-related neurocircuitry. Following 1 h restraint, OPFR-treated females showed heightened serum corticosterone. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed sex-dependent disruptions in key stress-regulatory pathways after OPFR treatment and 1 h restraint in the hypothalamus (Crhr1, Crhr2, Ptpn5) and pituitary (Crhr1, Pomc, Nr3c1). Females demonstrated more differences in adrenal gene expression related to steroidogenesis (Mc2r, Cyp11b2) and catecholamine biosynthesis (Dbh, Pnmt), with OPFR-treated groups having blunted responses. OPFR AVS females displayed reduced corticosterone and downregulated Pacap/Pac1r expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), accompanied by increased behavioral avoidance and immobility. In males, OPFR exposure led to increased BNST Pacap and Pac1r, expression, along with hyperactivity and avoidance behaviors. Together, these findings demonstrate that early-life OPFR exposure induces lasting, sex-specific dysregulation of the HPA axis and associated stress circuits, highlighting OPFRs as developmental neuroendocrine disruptors with implications for mood and stress-related disorders.",

    "title": "The SNCA A53T mutation sensitizes human neurons and microglia to ferroptosis",
    "content": "The major pathological hallmarks of sporadic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the targeted and progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDA), associated with systemic iron accumulation, a-synuclein (asyn) accumulation and aggregation, and lipid peroxidation amongst other reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Therapeutic strategies aimed towards dopamine restoration, asyn removal and iron chelation have provided symptomatic relief but failed to prevent or slow disease progression. This is in part due to the lack of understanding of the exact pathways leading to neuronal death in PD. In this study, we investigate ferroptosis, a unique cell death mechanism sharing multiple features with PD pathology, as a relevant pathway with implications in disease pathogenesis. We identified an enrichment of ferroptosis genes dysregulated throughout PD postmortem brain samples and several neuronal and glial PD models. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a rapid iPSC-derived synucleinopathy neuronal model harbouring the SNCA A53T mutation and report increased ROS generation, reduced levels of antioxidant glutathione (GSH), impaired mitophagy and a heightened vulnerability to ferroptosis-induced lipid peroxidation and cell death. Critically, inhibition of the key lipid peroxidation enzyme and driver of ferroptosis, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), rescued synucleinopathy associated pathologies and prevented pathological asyn oligomerisation in SNCA A53T neurons. Furthermore, we report enhanced microglial ferroptosis susceptibility in models of synucleinopathy. In summary, we highlight a new mechanism by which the familial PD-associated SNCA A53T mutation causes cell death and propose 15-LO inhibition as a tractable therapeutic opportunity in PD.",

    "title": "Slow Intrinsic Oscillations in the Ventrolateral Preoptic nucleus",
    "content": "The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) of the hypothalamus plays a major role in the induction and consolidation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. While VLPO neurons are heterogeneous, they often display low-threshold spikes (LTS), a feature that supports rhythmic activity. Nevertheless, rhythmic bursting in these VLPO neurons has never been observed. Here, we report that ~12% of VLPO neurons in a large database of ex vivo patch-clamp recordings display spontaneous rhythmic bursting of action potentials. This activity occurred in putative sleep-promoting neurons, identified by inhibitory responses to noradrenaline (NA), as well as wake-active neurons that were activated by NA. Unsupervised clustering of 24 neurons based on burst properties, electrophysiological, and morphological features revealed three distinct groups: one corresponding to putative sleep-promoting neurons and two wake-active neurons with fast and slow bursting dynamics. Strikingly, membrane potential oscillations persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), indicating that rhythmic bursting is driven by intrinsic mechanisms rather than network activity. These findings suggest that rhythmic bursting is an intrinsic and functionally relevant mode of activity in VLPO neurons, which may contribute to sleep regulation.",

    "content": "Wolfram-like syndrome leads to retinal ganglion cell degeneration and vision loss. Wolfram-like syndrome is primarily caused by variants in the WFS1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident transmembrane protein, Wolframin. To date, the disease mechanism remains unclear, and no therapies are available. Here, we generated a mouse model carrying the pathogenic WFS1E864K allele that recapitulated key features of human Wolfram-like syndrome, including bilateral optic atrophy, retinal nerve fiber thinning and lamination of the outer plexiform layer. We demonstrated, using the Wfs1E864K mouse model, that alteration of the protein leads to impairments of retinal ganglion cell function, associated with a thinning of the inner retina layer and nerve fibers. These alterations are associated with myelin disorganization, axonal death, mitochondrial alterations in the axons, and impairment of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria communication in the soma. Our data showed that primary deficits are localized in the optic nerve before progressing towards the retinal ganglion cell soma. RNAseq analysis identified several altered signaling pathways such as in lipid metabolism, glia activation response, metabolic stress, organelle transport and quality control. These findings highlighted the critical role of Wolframin in optic nerve mitochondrial physiology, providing us with a pertinent model to develop novel innovative therapeutic strategies.",

It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

    "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.10173v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper introduces Chord Colourizer, a near real-time system that detects the musical key of an audio signal and visually represents it through a novel graphical user interface (GUI). The system assigns colours to musical notes based on Isaac Newton's original colour wheel, preserving historical links between pitch and hue, and also integrates an Arduino-controlled LED display using 3D-printed star-shaped diffusers to offer a physical ambient media representation. The method employs Constant-Q Transform (CQT) chroma features for chord estimation and visualization, followed by threshold-based filtering and tonal enhancement to isolate the root, third, and fifth. A confidence score is computed for each detection to ensure reliability, and only chords with moderate to very strong certainty are visualized. The graphical interface dynamically updates a colour-coded keyboard layout, while the LED display provides the same colour information via spatial feedback. This multi-modal system enhances user interaction with harmonic content, offering innovative possibilities for education and artistic performance. Limitations include slight latency and the inability to detect extended chords, which future development will aim to address through refined filtering, adaptive thresholds, and support for more complex harmonies such as sevenths and augmented chords. Future work will also explore integration with alternative visualization styles, and the comparison of audio analysis libraries to improve detection speed and precision. Plans also include formal user testing to evaluate perception, usability, and cross-cultural interpretations of colour-pitch mappings.",

Past work has identified many individual factors that can drive human-companion interaction, but we know little about how these factors interact and evolve over time. In Study 1, we surveyed AI companion users (N = 303) to map the psychological pathway from users' mental models of the agent to parasocial experiences, social interaction, and the psychological impact of AI companions. Participants' responses foregrounded multiple interconnected variables (agency, parasocial interaction, and engagement) that shape AI companionship. In Study 2, we conducted a longitudinal study with a subset of participants (N = 110) using a new generic chatbot. Participants' perceptions of the generic chatbot significantly converged to perceptions of their own companions by Week 3. These results suggest a longitudinal model of AI companionship development and demonstrate an empirical method to study human-AI companionship.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.10049v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable end-users to delegate complex tasks to autonomous agents through natural language. However, prompt-based interaction faces critical limitations: Users often struggle to specify procedural requirements for tasks, especially those that don't have a factually correct solution but instead rely on personal preferences, such as posting social media content or planning a trip. Additionally, a ''successful'' prompt for one task may not be reusable or generalizable across similar tasks. We present ALLOY, a system inspired by classical HCI theories on Programming by Demonstration (PBD), but extended to enhance adaptability in creating LLM-based web agents. ALLOY enables users to express procedural preferences through natural demonstrations rather than prompts, while making these procedures transparent and editable through visualized workflows that can be generalized across task variations. In a study with 12 participants, ALLOY's demonstration--based approach outperformed prompt-based agents and manual workflows in capturing user intent and procedural preferences in complex web tasks. Insights from the study also show how demonstration--based interaction complements the traditional prompt-based approach.",

Taking Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) as a representative chronic condition, this paper presents a two-part mixed-methods study that examines how patients and physicians in China evaluate the quality and usability of AI-generated health information. Study~1 analyzes 784 authentic patient questions to identify seven core categories of informational needs and five evaluation dimensions -- \\textit{Accuracy, Safety, Clarity, Integrity}, and \\textit{Action Orientation}. Study~2 involves seven endocrinologists who assess responses from four mainstream AI models across these dimensions. Quantitative and qualitative findings reveal consistent strengths in factual and lifestyle guidance but significant weaknesses in medication interpretation, contextual reasoning, and empathy. Patients view AI as an accessible ``pre-visit educator,'' whereas clinicians highlight its lack of clinical safety and personalization. Together, the findings inform design implications for interactive health systems, advocating for multi-model orchestration, risk-aware fallback mechanisms, and emotionally attuned communication to ensure trustworthy AI assistance in chronic disease care.",

While several interventions (e.g., pharmacological and psychotherapeutic techniques) have been introduced for anxiety alleviation, the recently emerged virtual reality (VR) technology, with its immersive and playful nature, opened new opportunities for complementing and enhancing the therapeutic effects of existing interventions. In this light, we conducted a series of co-design workshops with 13 children aged 10-12 to explore how they envisioned using VR to address their fear and stress associated with dental visits, followed by interviews with parents (n = 13) and two dentists. Our findings revealed that children expected VR to provide immediate relief, social support, and a sense of control during dental treatment, parents sought educational opportunities for their children to learn about oral health, and dentists prioritized treatment efficiency and safety issues. Drawing from the findings, we discuss the considerations of multi-stakeholders for developing VR-assisted anxiety management applications for children within and beyond dental settings.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.09944v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Research on Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) has traditionally examined how humans rely on one another cognitively and socially to accomplish tasks together. With the rapid advancement of AI and large language models, however, a new question emerge: what happens to team dynamics when one of the \"teammates\" is not human? In this study, we investigate how the integration of an AI teammate -- a fully autonomous GPT-4 agent with social, cognitive, and affective capabilities -- shapes the socio-cognitive dynamics of CPS. We analyze discourse data collected from human-AI teaming (HAT) experiments conducted on a novel platform specifically designed for HAT research. Using two natural language processing (NLP) methods, specifically Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and Group Communication Analysis (GCA), we found that AI teammates often assumed the role of dominant cognitive facilitators, guiding, planning, and driving group decision-making. However, they did so in a socially detached manner, frequently pushing agenda in a verbose and repetitive way. By contrast, humans working with AI used more language reflecting social processes, suggesting that they assumed more socially oriented roles. Our study highlights how learning analytics can provide critical insights into the socio-cognitive dynamics of human-AI collaboration.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.09874v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The paper presents the first results of an artistic research project investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) curate and present collective memory. In a public installation exhibited during two months in Vienna in 2025, visitors could interact with five different LLMs (ChatGPT with GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini, Mistral Large, DeepSeek-Chat, and a locally run Llama 3.1 model), which were instructed to act as narrators, implementing a role-playing game revolving around the murder of Austrian philosopher Moritz Schlick in 1936. Results of the investigation include protocols of LLM-user interactions during the game and qualitative conversations after the play experience to get insight into the players' reactions to the game. In a quantitative analysis 115 introductory texts for role-playing generated by the LLMs were examined by different methods of natural language processing, including semantic similarity and sentiment analysis. While the qualitative player feedback allowed to distinguish three distinct types of users, the quantitative text analysis showed significant differences between how the different LLMs presented the historical content. Our study thus adds to ongoing efforts to analyse LLM performance, but also suggests a way of how these efforts can be disseminated in a playful way to a general audience.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.09791v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Various analytical techniques-such as scenario modeling, sensitivity analysis, perturbation-based analysis, counterfactual analysis, and parameter space analysis-are used across domains to explore hypothetical scenarios, examine input-output relationships, and identify pathways to desired results. Although termed differently, these methods share common concepts and methods, suggesting unification under what-if analysis. Yet a unified framework to define motivations, core components, and its distinct types is lacking. To address this gap, we reviewed 141 publications from leading visual analytics and HCI venues (2014-2024). Our analysis (1) outlines the motivations for what-if analysis, (2) introduces Praxa, a structured framework that identifies its fundamental components and characterizes its distinct types, and (3) highlights challenges associated with the application and implementation. Together, our findings establish a standardized vocabulary and structural understanding, enabling more consistent use across domains and communicate with greater conceptual clarity. Finally, we identify open research problems and future directions to advance what-if analysis.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.09763v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI-driven applications have become woven into students' academic and creative workflows, influencing how they learn, write, and produce ideas. Gaining a nuanced understanding of these usage patterns is essential, yet conventional survey and interview methods remain limited by recall bias, self-presentation effects, and the underreporting of habitual behaviors. While ethnographic methods offer richer contextual insights, they often face challenges of scale and reproducibility. To bridge this gap, we introduce a privacy-conscious approach that repurposes VPN-based network traffic analysis as a scalable ethnographic technique for examining students' real-world engagement with AI tools. By capturing anonymized metadata rather than content, this method enables fine-grained behavioral tracing while safeguarding personal information, thereby complementing self-report data. A three-week field deployment with university students reveals fragmented, short-duration interactions across multiple tools and devices, with intense bursts of activity coinciding with exam periods-patterns mirroring institutional rhythms of academic life. We conclude by discussing methodological, ethical, and empirical implications, positioning network traffic analysis as a promising avenue for large-scale digital ethnography on technology-in-practice.",

    "title": "People use fast, flat goal-directed simulation to reason about novel problems",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.11503v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Games have long been a microcosm for studying planning and reasoning in both natural and artificial intelligence, especially with a focus on expert-level or even super-human play. But real life also pushes human intelligence along a different frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making problems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice gameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem settings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how they play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how fun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these capacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the \"Intuitive Gamer\". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited) goal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo tree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few stochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep search. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000 participants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our participants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions varying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no experience at all (\"just thinking\"), to a single round of play, to indirect experience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and does so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level models. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly evaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could inform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine not just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at all.",

    "title": "Refining RDoC Using Individual-Level Task fMRI Factor Models Reveals Reproducible Brain-wide Motifs",
    "content": "The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework was introduced to guide psychiatric research using biologically grounded, dimensional constructs of mental function. However, its current hierarchical domain structure remains largely unvalidated against individual-level brain imaging data. Building on our prior group-level work showing that data-driven bifactor models outperform RDoC-based models, we applied a multi-stage validation framework to Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI data to test whether individual-level, empirically derived models more accurately reflect the intrinsic organization and behavioral relevance of brain activity. Using confirmatory factor analysis in two independent cohorts, we found that individual-level, data-driven bifactor models consistently outperformed RDoC-based models across multiple fit indices in both training and validation sets. The general factor derived from these models revealed a reproducible macroscale gradient spanning visual-attentional to auditory-default mode networks, aligning with canonical resting-state gradients and supporting its interpretation as a domain-general axis of large-scale brain organization. Applying community detection to subject-specific factor representations revealed four spatial motifs whose centroids corresponded to interpretable brain systems and were robustly reproduced across cohorts. Similarity to these centroids predicted individual task performance in working memory and relational reasoning, as measured by both raw accuracy and latent performance factors. To further assess organizational validity, we applied Mapper-a topological data analysis method-to contrast maps, generating unsupervised graph representations of task-evoked brain activity. Mapper graphs annotated with data-driven centroids showed greater modularity than those annotated with RDoC domains, suggesting that the data-driven framework better captures the topological structure of individual functional brain states. Together, these findings demonstrate that individual-level, data-driven factor models provide a more accurate, interpretable, and behaviorally relevant account of brain organization than the current RDoC framework. By modeling inter-individual variability directly from neuroimaging data, this approach advances precision neuroscience and supports the empirical refinement of dimensional psychiatric frameworks such as RDoC.",

    "content": "In humans and non-human primates, the extrastriate visual cortex contains fine-scale columns selectively responsive to motion, disparity, and color. However, the developmental interplay between these functional modules remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI, we compared the mesoscale organization of extrastriate cortex in 16 individuals with normal vision and 15 participants with amblyopia (PwA) caused by strabismus (n=8) or anisometropia (n=7). In controls, the cortical territory occupied by disparity-selective columns exhibited a competitive relationship with that of motion- and color-selective columns. Consistent with this pattern, PwA showed a reduction in disparity-selective responses accompanied by enhanced motion- and color-selective activity, as well as expansion of the cortical territory allocated to them. Our results show that the mesoscale modules of the human visual system are rivals in development allowing intact functions to usurp those that are compromised.",

    "title": "Age differences in electrocortical dynamics during uneven terrain walking",
    "content": "Walking on uneven terrain becomes more difficult as we age, and gait becomes less automatic. Using mobile brain imaging via high-density electroencephalography (EEG) can provide insight into the neural mechanisms contributing to reduced mobility capability with aging. The objective of this study was to quantify age differences in electrocortical dynamics during uneven terrain walking, both averaged across many strides and variations within a stride. We included 31 young adults and 71 older adults for analysis. All participants walked on an uneven terrain treadmill with four levels of terrain difficulty at their self-selected speed. Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibited a greater increase in step duration variability and mediolateral sacral excursion variability as the terrain became more uneven. We identified multiple brain regions involved during walking on uneven terrain. Regardless of age group, walking on uneven terrain compared to flat terrain led to a widespread change of electrocortical dynamics in the brain, especially in the alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) band power. In the parieto-occipital region, younger adults experienced a greater reduction in alpha and beta power with increasing terrain unevenness compared to older adults. We also assessed how intra-stride power fluctuations changed with terrain unevenness and age group. Greater intra-stride power spectral fluctuations in the occipital area were associated with greater terrain unevenness for younger adults, but not for older adults. In summary, older adults showed a greater increase in gait variability than younger adults as the terrain became more uneven, but exhibited a lack of modulation of parieto-occipital activity in response to terrain unevenness. The lack of task-related power modulation may suggest reduced cortical network flexibility in older adults. The absence of increased parieto-occipital activity when walking on uneven versus flat surfaces in older adults may also indicate that, unlike younger adults, older adults already heavily rely on visual processes during flat surface walking and may therefore have reduced occipital modulation range remaining to cope with the visuomotor processing demands of walking on uneven surfaces.",

    "title": "Peripheral Inflammation Limits Serotonin Neuron Signaling Capacity via Serotonergic IL-1R1 to Reduce Neuronal Excitability and Enhance Serotonin Clearance",
    "content": "Neurobehavioral disorders, ranging from depression to schizophrenia, have been found to display immune system alterations. The high incidence of comorbidity of these disorders, particularly depression, with chronic inflammatory conditions suggests shared mechanisms contributing to the manifestation of these conditions. We have previously shown that peripheral modulation of the innate immune system in mice rapidly triggers enhanced serotonin (5-HT) clearance in vivo associated with increased anxiety- and despair-like behaviors that can be suppressed by serotonergic elimination of p38 MAPK. Forebrain-projecting 5-HT synthesizing neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT) play a key role in regulating behaviors related to mood and anxiety and whose perturbations are observed in multiple affective disorders. Here we identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms that can translate peripheral innate immune system activation into changes in 5-HT signaling capacity. Using whole cell patch clamp recordings from acute midbrain slices, we demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1{beta}, acts cell autonomously through its receptor, IL-1R1, via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to rapidly inhibit firing of DRN5-HT neurons. In the dorsal hippocampus, we found that as with acute, peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, local injections of IL-1{beta} rapidly enhance 5-HT clearance as assessed by in vivo chronoamperometry. Like IL-1{beta}, TNF also acts via a serotonergic p38 MAPK dependent pathway to reduce excitability of DRN5-HT neurons. Immunocytochemical studies reveal that, IL-1R1, is nonuniformly expressed by DRN5-HT neurons and is required for LPS-induced inhibition of these cells as detected by cFos activation, with sex-dependent patterns evident. Moreover, we detected both DRN5-HT IL-1R1-dependent and -independent LPS-mediated changes in cFos changes in forbrain projection areas. Our findings support a growing appreciation that serotoninergic neurons contribute to changes in CNS physiology and behavior following peripheral immune activation. More specifically, our studies attest to a functional role of serotonergic IL-1R1 in mediating IL-1{beta} following peripheral innate immune activation, effects likely to arise both from changes in diminished 5-HT neuron excitability and elevated 5-HT clearance.",

    "title": "A compressed code for memory discrimination",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.10791v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The ability to discriminate similar visual stimuli is an important index of memory function. This ability is widely thought to be supported by expanding the dimensionality of relevant neural codes, such that neural representations for similar stimuli are maximally distinct, or ``separated.'' An alternative hypothesis is that discrimination is supported by lossy compression of visual inputs, efficiently coding sensory information by discarding seemingly irrelevant details. A benefit of compression, relative to expansion, is that it allows individuals to retain fewer essential dimensions underlying stimulus variation -- a process linked to higher-order visual processing -- without hindering discrimination. Under this hypothesis, pattern separation is facilitated when more information from similar stimuli can be discarded, rather than preserved. We test the compression versus expansion hypotheses by predicting performance on the canonical mnemonic similarity task. We train neural networks to compress perceptual and semantic factors of stimuli, measuring lossiness using the mathematical framework underlying compression. Consistent with the compression hypothesis, and not the expansion hypothesis, greater lossiness predicts the ease and performance of lure discrimination, especially in deeper convolutional network layers that predict higher-order visual brain activity. We then confirm these predictions across two image sets, four behavioral datasets, and alternative lossiness metrics. Finally, using task fMRI, we identify signatures of lossy compression -- neural dimensionality reduction and information loss -- in higher-order visual regions V4 and IT and hippocampal DG/CA3 and CA1 linked to lure discrimination. These results suggest lossy compression supports mnemonic discrimination by discarding redundant and overlapping information.",

    "title": "The Cost of Simplicity: How Reducing EEG Electrodes Affects Source Localization and BCI Accuracy",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.10770v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electrode density optimization in electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) requires balancing practical usability against signal fidelity, particularly for source localization. Reducing electrodes enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio (Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures. Most importantly, the sqrt(Re) scaling law may provide the first principled method to determine the minimal electrode density required based on acceptable error margins or expected effect sizes.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.10733v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity, enabling Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for communication and control. However, their performance is limited by signal fidelity issues, among which the choice of re-referencing strategy is a pervasive but often overlooked preprocessing bias. Addressing controversies about its necessity and optimal choice, we adopted a quantified approach to evaluate four strategies - no re-referencing, Common Average Reference (CAR), small Laplacian, and large Laplacian - using 62-channels EEG (31 subjects, 2,520 trials). To our knowledge, this is the first study systematically quantifying their impact on single-trial P300 classification accuracy. Our controlled pipeline isolated re-referencing effects for source-space reconstruction (eLORETA with Phase Lag Index) and anatomically constrained classification. The large Laplacian resolves distributed P3b networks while maintaining P3a specificity, achieving the best P300 peak classification accuracy (81.57% hybrid method; 75.97% majority regions of interest). Performance follows a consistent and statistically significant hierarchy: large Laplacian > CAR > no re-reference > small Laplacian, providing a foundation for unified methodological evaluation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.10559v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This review examines the evidence in the literature for physiological co-modulation during human-animal interaction. The aim of this work is to identify studies that assessed co-modulation via simultaneous measurement of physiological signals in both species, performing quantitative comparisons, and evaluate the consistency of the findings.\\\\ We searched PubMed, EM-BASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Animal Studies Repository, and the ''Consensus app'' tool between June and August 2025 (last search: August 5, 2025). Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the ROBINS-I V2 tool. Results were grouped by data analysis method, interaction context, and physiological parameter. Data were synthesised narratively, in structured tables and in barplots. Thirty-seven studies were included, primarily focusing on dogs (n=22) and horses (n=15), framed primarily within the interaction contexts of Animal-Assisted Therapy and Intervention (AAT and AAI) and companionship. Cardiac and hormonal measures were most frequently assessed. Most studies (n = 20) performed correlation analyses. Sample sizes ranged from less than 10 to more than 130 dyads. Co-modulation resulted significant in 22 studies, partial (limited to subsets of data) in 9, and absent in 6. Time-series coupling methods yielded more consistent evidence than discrete-time correlations. Many studies had small samples and did not explicitly test for significant co-modulation. Evidence, while not conclusive, supports physiological co-modulation during human-animal interactions. However, studies' heterogeneity limits generalizability: rather than indicating a universal phenomenon, findings suggest co-modulation may emerge under specific biological and methodological conditions. Future research should explicitly test its presence across contexts.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.10308v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping the way we construct computational counterparts of the brain, giving rise to a new class of ``surrogate brains''. In contrast to conventional hypothesis-driven biophysical models, the AI-based surrogate brain encompasses a broad spectrum of data-driven approaches to solve the inverse problem, with the primary objective of accurately predicting future whole-brain dynamics with historical data. Here, we introduce a unified framework of constructing an AI-based surrogate brain that integrates forward modeling, inverse problem solving, and model evaluation. Leveraging the expressive power of AI models and large-scale brain data, surrogate brains open a new window for decoding neural systems and forecasting complex dynamics with high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and adaptability. We highlight that the learned surrogate brain serves as a simulation platform for dynamical systems analysis, virtual perturbation, and model-guided neurostimulation. We envision that the AI-based surrogate brain will provide a functional bridge between theoretical neuroscience and translational neuroengineering.",

These lattices show non-random features-frequent dendritic convergence, hub nodes, small-world connectivity, and large voids. Synaptic contacts cluster and strengthen at hubs. Strikingly, these properties mirror the cosmic web: dendritic branches resemble cosmic filaments and synapses map to galaxies. Quantitative metrics align across systems, suggesting shared underlying geometric principles. We invite cross-disciplinary collaboration to interrogate and extend these parallels.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.10251v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis posits that at least some important cognitive processes involve language-like representations. These representations must be processed by appropriate hardware. Since the organ of biological cognition is the nervous system, whether biological cognition relies on a LOT depends on how neural hardware works. I distinguish between different versions of LOT, articulate their hardware requirements, and consider which versions of LOT are supported by empirical evidence. I argue that the Classical LOT hypothesis (Fodor 1975) is ruled out; the version of LOT that is best supported by empirical evidence is the Nonclassical LOT thesis that some neural representations mirror some of the structure of natural language and represent in a language-like way, yet they encode information nondigitally and are processed by ordinary (nondigital, and hence Nonclassical) neural computations that rely not only on syntactic structure but many other features.",

    "title": "Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.09951v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs.We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture.In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.",

    "title": "A mathematical theory for understanding when abstract representations emerge in neural networks",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.09816v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent experiments reveal that task-relevant variables are often encoded in approximately orthogonal subspaces of the neural activity space. These disentangled low-dimensional representations are observed in multiple brain areas and across different species, and are typically the result of a process of abstraction that supports simple forms of out-of-distribution generalization. The mechanisms by which such geometries emerge remain poorly understood, and the mechanisms that have been investigated are typically unsupervised (e.g., based on variational auto-encoders). Here, we show mathematically that abstract representations of latent variables are guaranteed to appear in the last hidden layer of feedforward nonlinear networks when they are trained on tasks that depend directly on these latent variables. These abstract representations reflect the structure of the desired outputs or the semantics of the input stimuli. To investigate the neural representations that emerge in these networks, we develop an analytical framework that maps the optimization over the network weights into a mean-field problem over the distribution of neural preactivations. Applying this framework to a finite-width ReLU network, we find that its hidden layer exhibits an abstract representation at all global minima of the task objective. We further extend these analyses to two broad families of activation functions and deep feedforward architectures, demonstrating that abstract representations naturally arise in all these scenarios. Together, these results provide an explanation for the widely observed abstract representations in both the brain and artificial neural networks, as well as a mathematically tractable toolkit for understanding the emergence of different kinds of representations in task-optimized, feature-learning network models.",

JA5 client fingerprinting (<a href=\"https://tempesta-tech.com/knowledge-base/Traffic-Filtering-by-Fingerprints/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://tempesta-tech.com/knowledge-base/Traffic-Filtering-b...</a>). This is a HTTP and TLS layers fingerprinting, similar to JA4 (<a href=\"https://blog.foxio.io/ja4%2B-network-fingerprinting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blog.foxio.io/ja4%2B-network-fingerprinting</a>) and JA3 fingerprints. The last is also available in Envoy (<a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/listener/tls_inspector/v3/tls_inspector.proto.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extension...</a>) or Nginx module (<a href=\"https://github.com/fooinha/nginx-ssl-ja3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/fooinha/nginx-ssl-ja3</a>), so check the documentation for your web server<p>2. Access logs are directly written to Clickhouse analytics database, which can cunsume large data batches and quickly run analytic queries. For other web proxies beside Tempesta FW, you typically need to build a custom pipeline to load access logs into Clickhouse. Such pipeliens aren't so rare though.<p>3. Abbility to block web clients by IP or JA5 hashes. IP blocking is probably available in any HTTP proxy.<p>*How does it work*<p>This is a daemon, which<p>1. Learns normal traffic profiles: means and standard deviations for client requests per second, error responses, bytes per second and so on. Also it remembers client IPs and fingerprints.<p>2. If it sees a spike in z-score (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score</a>) for traffic characteristics or can be triggered manually. Next, it goes in data model search mode<p>3. For example, the first model could be top 100 JA5 HTTP hashes, which produce the most error responses per second (typical for password crackers). Or it could be top 1000 IP addresses generating the most requests per second (L7 DDoS). Next, this model is going to be verified<p>4. The daemon repeats the query, but for some time, long enough history, in the past to see if in the past we saw a hige fraction of clients in both the query results. If yes, then the model is bad and we got to previous step to try another one. If not, then we (likely) has found the representative query.<p>5. Transfer the IP addresses or JA5 hashes from the query results into the web proxy blocking configuration and reload the proxy configuration (on-the-fly).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45583667\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45583667</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "Social anxiety (SA) is associated with enhanced error monitoring, yet underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Consistent with cognitive models of SA, we propose that stronger error monitoring contributes to SA by strengthening memory encoding of errors (including relevant social cues), negatively biasing what is remembered. Supporting this hypothesis, our prior work demonstrated that high SA individuals exhibit better memory for faces presented during error (vs. correct) trials. To test whether this Memory Bias for Error Events is specific to social stimuli, 140 participants completed a Flanker task with trial-unique faces (social) or objects (non-social) as background images, followed by a surprise memory test. Results revealed that higher SA symptoms were associated with enhanced memory for faces on error (vs. correct) trials, but not for objects. These findings replicate and extend our prior work, demonstrating that SA-related memory biases for errors are specific to social stimuli, rather than reflecting general encoding biases.",

This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "Social coordination in primates relies on parieto-frontal networks encoding self- and others actions. These areas send convergent projections to the putamen, but its role in representing self- and others actions remains unknown. We recorded neuronal activity from anatomically characterized putamen regions during a Mutual Action Task (MAT), where a monkey and a human took turns grasping a multi-affordance object based on sensory cues. Cortico-striatal synaptic input, indexed by local field potentials, mirrored known cortical dynamics during sensory instructions and movement, while single neurons selectively encoded the monkey s action, the human s action, or both. Grip type was encoded only during the monkey s trials. Viewing the partner s action was neither necessary nor sufficient: neurons fired even when the partner s action occurred in darkness, but not when viewed through a transparent barrier. These findings support a pragmatic role for the putamen in gating cortical representations of self- and other s actions in social contexts",

    "title": "Comparison of T1- and T2-weighted MRI contrasts of ex vivo ex situ brains fixed with solutions used in gross anatomy laboratories",
    "content": "Post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers high resolution and histological correlation, so protocols have been developed by brain banks using hemispheres fixed by immersion in Neutral-buffered formalin (NBF), but they provide limited tissue samples. Conversely, anatomy laboratories could supply complete brains perfused either with a salt-saturated (SSS) or an alcohol-formaldehyde (AFS) solution. These fixation methods alter the brain's molecular properties, potentially affecting MRI quality and structural characteristics. T1- and T2-weighted (T1w, T2w) contrasts change with NBF fixation, but the effects of SSS or AFS remain unknown. We compared T1w and T2w intensities of different regions of interest (ROIs), including subcortical white matter (WM), cortical and deep gray matter (GM), in brains fixed with NBF, SSS and AFS. We scanned 20 ex situ hemispheres (NBF-immersed=7; SSS-perfused=7; AFS-perfused=6) in a 3T MRI scanner using T1w (0.7mm3) and T2w (0.64mm3) sequences overnight. Mean intensities of 29 ROIs in T1w and T2w MRIs and GM-WM ratios were calculated and compared in brains fixed with the three solutions. We found that T1w images were more affected by the fixation process, inverting the contrast of in vivo T1w and reducing the GM-WM contrast in AFS-fixed brains. T2w images resembled in vivo scans and maintained a sharp contrast in brains fixed with the three solutions, although the GM-WM intensity ratios were lowered in SSS-fixed brains. In conclusion, brains fixed with SSS and AFS from anatomy laboratories could be used for MRI studies, especially with the T2w sequence that seems more appropriate for structural analyses in different ROIs.",

    "title": "Functional MRI signals as fast as 1Hz are coupled to brain states and predict spontaneous neural activity",
    "content": "fMRI signals were traditionally seen as slow and sampled in the order of seconds, but recent technological advances have enabled much faster sampling rates. We hypothesized that high-frequency fMRI signals can capture spontaneous neural activity that index brain states. Using fast fMRI (TR=378ms) and simultaneous EEG in 27 humans drifting between sleep and wakefulness, we found that fMRI spectral power increased during NREM sleep (compared to wakefulness) across several frequency ranges as fast as 1Hz. This fast fMRI power was correlated with canonical arousal-linked EEG rhythms (alpha and delta), with spatiotemporal correlation patterns for each rhythm reflecting a combination of shared arousal dynamics and rhythm-specific neural signatures. Using machine learning, we found that alpha and delta EEG rhythms can be decoded from fast fMRI signals, in subjects held-out from the training set, showing that fMRI as fast as 0.9Hz (alpha) and 0.7Hz (delta) contains reliable neurally-coupled information that generalizes across individuals. Finally, we demonstrate that this fast fMRI acquisition allows for EEG rhythms to be decoded from 3.8s windows of fMRI data. These results reveal that high-frequency fMRI signals are coupled to dynamically varying brain states, and that fast fMRI sampling allows for more temporally precise quantification of spontaneous neural activity than previously thought possible.",

    "title": "HIF1\u03b1-dependent induction of the T-Type calcium channel CaV3.2 mediates hypoxia-induced neuronal hyperexcitability",
    "content": "Post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is a major cause of acquired epilepsy in adults, yet the molecular mechanisms linking post-ischemic hypoxia to neuronal hyperexcitability remain poorly understood. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a central mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia and may contribute to epileptogenesis by regulating ion channel expression. Here, we identify the T-type calcium channel CaV3.2 (encoded by Cacna1h) as a direct transcriptional target of HIF1 and demonstrate its role in hypoxia-induced network hyperexcitability. Using neuronal cell lines, primary cortical neurons, and organotypic brain slice cultures (OTCs) from mouse and human tissue, we show that HIF1 activation, either through hypoxia or HIF1 overexpression, consistently increases Cacna1h expression. In NS20Y cells, overexpression of a normoxia-stable HIF1 variant increased Cacna1h promoter activity in both fluorescent and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The same effect was observed in primary cortical neurons, where HIF1 overexpression also elevated network activity measured by multielectrode array recordings. In murine and human OTCs, hypoxia led to marked increase of HIF1 and Cacna1h expression at both transcript and protein levels. Furthermore, oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced a persistent increase in neuronal firing rate, which was recapitulated by HIF1 overexpression alone. Together, these results establish HIF1 as a key transcriptional regulator of CaV3.2 in neurons and reveal a conserved hypoxia-HIF1-CaV3.2 pathway that enhances neuronal excitability. This mechanism may underlie hypoxia-induced network hyperactivity and contribute to the pathogenesis of post-ischemic epileptogenesis.",

    "title": "Dynamic electrocortical states and paradoxical complexity during desflurane anesthesia",
    "content": "Background: How general anesthesia alters the dynamics of electrocortical activity is crucial to understand the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness. Local cortical activity undergoes spontaneous transitions at constant anesthetic concentration. The spatial organization and temporal dynamics of state transitions in large-scale electrocortical activity is incompletely understood. Methods: Epidural electrocorticogram was recorded from the right hemisphere in 8 rats (14 experiments) using chronically implanted 32-channel flexible electrode arrays during desflurane anesthesia at 6%, 4%, 2%, 0% inhaled concentrations, each maintained for 1 hour. Cortical states were identified by principal component analysis of power spectrograms followed by density-based clustering simultaneously across all anesthetic conditions. State-specific spatiotemporal complexity was quantified by the normalized Lempel-Ziv algorithm to capture signal variability beyond spectral effects. Temporal dynamics were assessed by state occurrence, dwell times, and transition probabilities. Results: Seven cortical states were identified. Six states generally tracked anesthetic depth with an increase in delta power and decrease in complexity, but their occurrence was not tied to any anesthetic level (p<0.001). The 7th state was a paradoxical, activated state that mostly occurred during deep anesthesia and was marked by reduced delta (p<0.001) and elevated complexity (p<0.001). Cortical activity was more likely to remain in a given state than to switch (mean dwell time of 136.55 s, persistence likelihood of 99.36%). When transitions occurred, they followed structured, non-random dynamics, primarily within light- or deep-anesthesia states (FDR-corrected p<0.05), with a mild tendency to exit deep states and enter light states (p=0.0039), consistent with anesthetic emergence. Conclusions: Electrocortical activity is not a unitary function of anesthetic concentration but involves spontaneous dynamics and paradoxically activated states with increased global complexity during deep anesthesia. The results suggest ongoing spontaneous reorganization of cortical activity during prolonged anesthetic challenge and provide new insight into anesthesia-induced brain dynamics that may inform future strategies for monitoring and manipulating the state of consciousness and facilitating recovery from general anesthesia.",

    "content": "<p>Hey HN! Ilya and Nikita here. We're building wispbit (<a href=\"https://wispbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wispbit.com</a>) - a tool that helps keep codebase standards alive.<p>With the help of AI coding tools, engineers are writing more code than ever. Code output has increased, but the tooling to manage this hasn't improved. Background agents still write bad code, and your IDE still writes slop without the right context.<p>So we built wispbit. It works by scanning your codebase for patterns you already use, and coming up with rules. Rules are kept up to date as standards change, and you can edit rules any time.<p>You can enforce these rules during code review, and because we have this rules system, you can run a CLI locally to review using these rules. You can think of it as a portable rules file that you can bring anywhere.<p>We put a lot of work into making a system that produces good rules and avoids slop. For repository crawling, we have an agent that dispatches subagents, similar to Anthropic's research agent. These subagents will go through and look for common patterns within modules and directories, and report back to the main agent, which synthesizes the results. We also do a historical scan on your pull request comments, determine which ones were addressed, filter out comments that wouldn't make a good rule, and use that to create or update rules.<p>Our early users are seeing 80%+ resolution rates, meaning that 80% of comments that wispbit makes are resolved.<p>Long-term, we see ourselves being a validation layer for AI-written code. With tools like Devin and Cursor, we find ourselves having to re-prompt the same solution many times. We still don't know the long-term implications on AI-assisted codebases, so we want to get in front of that as soon as possible.<p>We've opened up signups for free to HN folks at <a href=\"https://wispbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wispbit.com</a>. We're also around to chat and answer questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45584017\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45584017</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

Robot-assisted training (RT) is a promising therapy in stroke rehabilitation, but for the elderly, traditional 'reaching objects'\" tasks do not seem to create sufficient motivation, an important factor in rehabilitation, which reduces the effect of rehabilitation. Combining RT with some popular card games like mahjong, a popular tiled-based game in the Chinese elderly, is a strategy...",

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

    "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Designing a Model to Detect Beta Burst in EEG Using Nonlinear Dynamic Features Based on Machine Learning",
    "content": "Background: Beta bursts are brief, transient increases in beta-band (13 to 30 Hz) EEG activity that play a key role in motor control, particularly in processes like movement initiation and inhibition. While most existing methods detect these bursts using simple amplitude thresholds, they often ignore variability in burst duration and task context. More advanced techniques exist but are computationally demanding, often opaque, and dependent on large datasets and strong modeling assumptions. Objectives: This study aims to develop an automated, machine learning based approach to classify beta bursts using nonlinear dynamic features, considering both burst duration and task condition. Method: EEG data were collected from 26 healthy, right-handed participants during three motor tasks: (1) a right-hand isometric pinch grip at 10% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), (2) rhythmic right-hand finger opening closing in response to auditory cues (3 4 seconds), and (3) the same right-hand opening closing task and concurrent with a steady left-hand isometric pinch grip at 10% MVC. Beta bursts were extracted from the left motor cortex, categorized by duration (short, medium, long), and time-locked to task events. From each burst, four nonlinear features, Fractal Dimension (FD), Wavelet Entropy (WE), Sample Entropy (SE), and Nonlinear Energy Operator (NEO) were calculated to train machine learning (ML) models. Results: Statistical tests and feature selection revealed that FD, SE, and WE varied significantly with burst duration and task type, while NEO was more limited in sensitivity. ML models trained on these features achieved up to 91.1% validation and 85.7% test accuracy, especially when distinguishing bursts of different durations within the same task. Conclusions: These findings suggest that beta bursts reflect structured, task-specific neural dynamics rather than random fluctuations. By using nonlinear features and ML, we introduce a scalable, interpretable framework for burst classification that outperforms traditional methods. This approach advances the understanding of transient beta activity and holds promise for real-time neural decoding in neuroscience and neurotechnology.",

    "content": "Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of microtubule-associated protein tau, which is closely linked to cognitive decline. Reduction of tau is a potential and promising strategy for addressing tau-linked brain disorders. We report the development of a therapeutic approach using adeno-associated virus mediated delivery of an artificial microRNA targeting human tau. In a tauopathy mouse model, we demonstrate that a one-time intra-cisterna magna administration of vector resulted in reduced total tau, decreased pathological tau seeds, fewer tau inclusions, and amelioration of tau-related neuropathology. Notably, intervention at late disease stages, after onset of tau deposition and neurodegeneration, improved quality of life and extended survival. We further demonstrated the durability of therapeutic benefit and defined the minimally effective dose in tauopathy mice. These findings provide preclinical support for the advancement of a vectorized tau-lowering strategy as a disease-modifying approach for tauopathies and enable progression towards an investigational new drug application.",

    "content": "Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience to model the collective activity of neurons during behavioral tasks. The high dimensionality of their parameter and activity spaces, however, often make it challenging to infer and interpret the fundamental features of their dynamics. In this study, we employ recent nonlinear dynamical system techniques to uncover the core dynamics of several RNNs used in contemporary neuroscience. Specifically, using a data-driven approach, we identify Spectral Submanifolds (SSMs), i.e., low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds tangent to the eigenspaces of fixed points. The internal dynamics of SSMs serve as nonlinear models that reduce the dimensionality of the full RNNs by orders of magnitude. Through low-dimensional, SSM-reduced models, we give mathematically precise definitions of line and ring attractors, which are intuitive concepts commonly used to explain decision-making and working memory. The new level of understanding of RNNs obtained from SSM reduction enables the interpretation of mathematically well-defined and robust structures in neuronal dynamics, leading to novel predictions about the neural computations underlying behavior.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

    "title": "Efficacy of snap-needle patch therapy in pediatric epilepsy: a case study",
    "content": "BackgroundsEpilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder in early childhood, often characterized by genetic predisposition and diverse clinical manifestations. Benign epilepsy of childhood with central temporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common form of self-limited focal epilepsy (SeLFE) syndrome in children, accounting for approximately 6%\u20137% of all childhood epilepsy cases (Wirrell et al., 2011; Camfield et al., 1996). We report a case of a child who was treated with additional snap-needle for 3 months on top of poorly controlled oral medication alone, who stopped having seizures and gradually reduced the dose of oral medication and finally stopped, and was followed up for 1 year after stopping the medication without any recurrence.Case summaryA 10-years-old male had his first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) at age 7 during nocturnal sleep. Following this event, the parents sought medical evaluation, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal wave patterns. Over the following 3 years, the child had 2\u20133 GTCS annually; despite multiple adjustments to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, GTCS frequency indicated disease progression. However, after starting snap-needle patch therapy [guided by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles], the child remained seizure-free. Continuous monitoring has been conducted to date. We present this case of a pediatric patient with epilepsy: oral medication failed to control GTCS, but snap-needle patch therapy achieved successful seizure management, after which oral medication was discontinued.ConclusionAfter a systematic literature search, this study represents the first case report of BECTS treated with snap-needle therapy (needle size: 0.220 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm). In this case, the child\u2019s GTCSs resolved following the addition of snap-needle therapy, and oral antiepileptic medication was gradually reduced to complete discontinuation; no seizure recurrence was observed within 1 year of follow-up. It is important to acknowledge that the contributions of medication adjustments and the self-limiting nature of BECTS cannot be ruled out in this case. However, based on the observations here, we propose the hypothesis that snap-needle intervention is likely associated with seizure remission. Although the mechanism underlying snap-needle therapy for BECTS remains unclear, the child achieved a QOLCE-16-C score of 98.4 at the end of treatment; during the 1-year follow-up, the number of nighttime sleep disruptions also decreased from 2 to 5 episodes per year to 0. These outcomes surpass those typically achievable through pharmacological intervention alone.",

    "title": "The articulatory basis of phonological error patterns in childhood speech sound disorders",
    "content": "Speech acquisition involves complex coordination of articulatory structures, primarily the jaw, lips, and tongue. Typically developing children acquire speech sounds in a hierarchical sequence governed by progressive neuromotor maturation. However, disruptions in speech motor control can lead to systematic phonological error patterns, commonly attributed to cognitive-linguistic deficits. This study explores the articulatory foundations of phonological error patterns in preschool-aged children diagnosed with moderate-to-severe speech sound disorders. Using data from 48 children who participated in a randomized controlled trial, we employed Mutual Information Analysis and Random Forest Models to quantify associations between specific speech motor limitations and phonological error patterns identified via the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology assessment. Results showed moderate associations between phonological error patterns in particular cluster reduction, final consonant deletion, stopping, gliding, and atypical errors and limitations in jaw, labial-facial, and lingual control. Gliding, unexpectedly, demonstrated a negative relationship with speech motor errors, being more prevalent among older and milder cases, suggesting it may reflect a compensatory developmental stage rather than purely phonological simplification. These findings highlight the significance of speech motor constraints in phonological error patterns, challenging traditional cognitive-linguistic explanations. The results support theoretical frameworks such as Articulatory Phonology, emphasizing that phonological error patterns are influenced substantially by articulatory and neuromotor development. This study underscores the need for integrating motor considerations into clinical assessments and interventions for speech sound disorders in children, fostering a comprehensive approach bridging cognitive-linguistic and motor speech perspectives.",

    "title": "Modeling dyslexia in neurotypical adults by combining neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques: a hypothesis paper",
    "content": "Dyslexia is a prevalent developmental disorder marked by deficits in literacy skills. Given that the core deficits of dyslexia are uniquely human, animal models have not been as useful in dyslexia research as they have been in other areas of research. While significant progress has been made through behavioral and neuroimaging studies, a viable model could facilitate controlled investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia and accelerate the development of targeted interventions. In this hypothesis article, we propose a two-pronged approach to model dyslexia in neurotypical adults using neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques. First, we propose using functional and structural MRI data to cluster individuals into neuropathologically derived subgroups in order to facilitate the classification of dyslexia subtypes based on neuropathological characteristics. Second, we propose employing transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) to temporarily downregulate activity in brain regions specified in the clustering analysis, inducing subtype-specific dyslexic symptoms in neurotypical individuals. This approach enables the establishment of causal or probabilistic relationships between neuropathologies and dyslexia subtypes, while at the same time creating dyslexia models to facilitate investigation into subtype-specific interventions. Although this model is somewhat limited by the transient nature of neuromodulation as well as by the use of healthy adults to model a developmental disorder whose symptoms first arise in childhood, it is a meaningful step towards refining our understanding of the neural basis of dyslexia subtypes and it opens the door to novel and effective therapies. By integrating neuroimaging and neuromodulation, we hope to offer a viable substitute for animal models in dyslexia and accelerate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for dyslexia.",

    "title": "Toward accurate single image sand dust removal by utilizing uncertainty-aware neural network",
    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

While lower-order decompositions reveal large-scale networks, higher-order models provide finer granularity but have been limited by small sample sizes. In this study, we applied sgr-ICA with 500 components to more than 100,000 subjects with rsfMRI to generate a robust fine-grained ICN template. Using this template, we examined whole brain functional network connectivity (FNC) in 502 individuals with schizophrenia and 640 typical controls and compared the findings with a lower order multiscale template. The 500-component template yielded a large set of reliable ICNs, particularly in the cerebellar and paralimbic regions, and revealed schizophrenia-related dysconnectivity patterns that were not detected at larger spatial scales. Specifically, we observed hypoconnectivity between the cerebellar and subcortical domains (basal ganglia and thalamus) and hyperconnectivity between the cerebellar domain and the visual, sensorimotor and higher cognitive domains. These results demonstrate that very high-order ICA can capture distinct fine-grained ICNs, improving the detection of disease-related connectivity differences and enriching current multiscale ICN templates. The derived ICNs can serve as a valuable reference for future studies and potentially enhance the clinical utility of rsfMRI in psychiatric research.",

    "content": "The small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel SK3, encoded by the KCNN3 gene, plays a critical role in regulating dopaminergic neuron (DN) firing patterns by modulating after hyperpolarization currents. SK3 dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed structural and functional consequences of KCNN3 splicing and genetic variation. Alternative splicing variants of the KCNN3 gene were retrieved from the Ensembl database and aligned using T-Coffee, manually inspected and curated. Protein domains were identified with Pfam 35.0, SMART 9.0, and InterPro 98.0, and visualized. An AlphaFold2 model of SK3 full-length protein (UniProt: Q9UGI6) used as reference and structural models of its splicing variants were predicted with ColabFold. Functional domains (S1\u2013S6 transmembrane helices, H5 pore loop, and calmodulin-binding) were defined and superimposed onto the AlphaFold2 reference. Domain integrity was assessed based on completeness of all expected residue indices within each functional region. SNPs and CNVs across all coding KCNN3 splicing variants were analyzed, classified, and filtered to isolate pathogenic variants prioritizing non-synonymous amino acid substitutions. Differential variant impacts across splicing isoforms were assessed by mapping variant positions to individual transcript protein sequences and used to predict functional consequences. Two long and two short splicing variants are known. Short variants lack the motif required for potassium channels. Pathogenic variants result from missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions. In all cases, the consequential effects depend on the specific location and role of the amino acid being changed.",

    "title": "Epileptic encephalopathy-related Kv2.1 mutants impair channel clustering and membrane distribution but not neuronal excitability",
    "content": "The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2.1, which is encoded by the epileptic encephalopathy-associated gene KCNB1, is a primary driver of delayed-rectifier K+ currents in neurons. These currents contribute to high frequency firing by preventing depolarization block due to Na+ channel inactivation. Wild-type (WT) channels are localized at the soma, proximal dendrites and axons, forming large aggregates (clusters) via their C-terminal proximal restriction and clustering domain (PRC). This study investigates the biophysical and functional consequences of two C-terminal truncation mutations (Y529* and R579*), identified in patients with epileptic encephalopathy, which disrupt this critical clustering domain. Cluster formation was impaired, though not abolished, in neurons expressing mutated subunits together with endogenous WT subunits. Consistent with this clustering deficit, single-molecule imaging revealed altered channel dynamics, with WT channels remaining largely immobile, while mutated forms exhibited intermittent diffusion punctuated by transient immobilization events. This behavior was reproduced by diffusion-capture simulations considering channels with different number of PRC domains (i.e. with mutant subunits) and labile scaffolding interactions. Patch-clamp recordings revealed no significant difference in excitability between WT and mutant-expressing neurons. However, we observed increased firing in both conditions compared to non-transfected neurons. This suggests that Kv2.1 overexpression (for both WT and mutant channels) counterintuitively enhances neuronal excitability. Our data challenge a canonical role of this voltage-gated potassium channel in dampening neuronal firing, indicating that its overall expression level can be a critical and paradoxical driver of hyperexcitability.",

    "title": "Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in Parkinson's disease: Effects of age, sex, and body mass index in a large fluorodopa PET cohort",
    "content": "BACKGROUND. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons leads to motor symptoms. Positron emission tomography (PET) using radioligand [18F]fluorodopa detects reduced striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in PD patients. Demographic factors such as sex and BMI are also associated with dopamine synthesis capacity. The combined contribution of demographic and clinical effects however remains elusive. It also remains unresolved how the dopamine synthesis capacity is correlated between striatal subregions and how the dopamine synthesis capacity and dopamine receptor function across striatal regions are associated with each other in PD patients and healthy controls. MATERIAL, AIMS, AND METHODS. For this retrospective register-based study, we used baseline [18F]fluorodopa PET data acquired at the Turku PET Centre between the years 1988-2016 with three different scanners (Ecat 931, GE Advance, HRRT). The data included scans of 350 adult human subjects, including 132 healthy controls (65 males and 67 females), and 218 PD patients (134 males and 84 females). The primary aim was to simultaneously investigate the effects of PD, age, sex and BMI on regional dopamine synthesis capacity (influx rate constant Kiref quantified with Patlak) using Bayesian linear regression. Secondary aims were to assess interregional correlations of dopamine synthesis capacity, and the association between regional presynaptic dopamine synthesis and postsynaptic dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R) availability in subjects who also had a proximal [11C]raclopride PET scan. RESULTS. We found modest support for age-dependent decline in dopamine synthesis capacity, increased capacity for higher BMIs, and for higher capacity in females versus males. These effects were smaller than the effect of PD status. Dopamine synthesis capacity across regions was correlated in both patients and controls. Support for positive correlation between the synthesis capacity and the D2R was observed in caudate nucleus. CONCLUSIONS. PD and demographic effects are independently associated with the striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. The capacity is reduced by PD, decreased through age (particularly after the age of around 50), higher in females versus males, and weakly increased in higher BMIs. Synthesis capacity is correlated between the striatal and thalamic regions in both PD patients and controls. The dopamine synthesis capacity was positively correlated with the D2R availability in caudate. Scanner affects the estimates of dopamine synthesis capacity measured with [18F]fluorodopa PET, and it is preferrable to adjust for such variation in the data.",

    "content": "Despite the increasing adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), developing high-degree-of-freedom (DOF) systems capable of decoding continuous movements, such as limb kinematics, remains a significant challenge. This difficulty stems from limited availability of task-specific neural features within individual neural signal datasets. To overcome this, we proposed a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to enrich training features within neural signal datasets. Specifically, we synthesized artificial neural signal waveforms of the primary motor cortex (M1) from functionally related cortical regions, thereby enhancing neural datasets for improved motor kinematics decoding via DNN. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during goal-directed arm-reaching tasks, our results showed that enhancing individual datasets with GAN-synthesized M1 signals significantly improved decoding performance by about 10% (p < 0.05). Such improved performance is sustained even in the absence of real M1 signals. Our results highlight the potential of signal generative networks for improving and augmenting high DOF motor BCIs to achieve freely intended movements.",

    "title": "A Hybrid Knowledge- and Data-driven Model for Automatic Assessment of Chemically Induced Spiking Patterns in C-fiber Microneurography",
    "content": "Analyzing temporal spike patterns in nociceptors recorded via microneurography is challenging due to the use of a single recording electrode, waveform variability, and high similarity of spike shapes across neurons limiting interpretation of sensory coding such as pain and itch. We present a data-driven, supervised spike sorting approach to improve the analysis of nociceptive discharges, identified through activity-dependent conduction velocity changes. Our method integrates three feature sets and applies machine learning models including one-class SVM, SVM, and XGBoost. Validation used experimentally derived ground truth data acquired by controlled electrical stimulation, allowing precise spike time-locking. Compared to Spike2 software, our approach achieved higher F1-scores and reduced false positives, indicating improved spike sorting. Although XGBoost achieved the highest median F1-scores, optimal performance was dependent on individual combinations of feature sets and models for each recording. In some recordings with many nerve fibers and a low signal-to-noise ratio, reliable sorting was not feasible. This highlights the necessity to determine sortability and optimal configures using a ground truth protocol for each recording. These findings represent an important step toward reliable analysis of nociceptive activity. The openly accessible framework supports analyzing pruritogen-induced and spontaneous activity in neuropathic pain patients, advancing tools for peripheral neural decoding.",

    "title": "Long-term dynamic profiles of cognitive kinases induced by different learning protocols",
    "content": "Learning is associated with activation of multiple protein kinases, but few details are known about the activation dynamics in response to different learning protocols. We addressed this issue by examining the long-term dynamics of kinases critical for long term synaptic facilitation (LTF) of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse. Three serotonin (5-HT) protocols have been found to induce LTF with distinct effectiveness: the five-pulse regular-spaced Standard protocol; the five-pulse irregular-spaced Enhanced protocol; and the two-pulse protocol with an interval of 45 min. We previously compared long-term dynamics of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform ERK after these protocols. Here we examined the long-term dynamics of additional kinases critical for LTF: p38 MAPK, protein kinase A (PKA), and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). All four kinases showed complex dynamics of activity during 24 h, with a first wave of increase occurring shortly after 5-HT treatment and ending within 5 h, and a second wave from ~ 5 h to 18 h. After the Standard and two-pulse protocols, all kinase activities returned towards basal at 24 h, but after the Enhanced protocol some remained elevated at 24 h. Interactions and multiple feedback loops among the kinase pathways, and with the growth factors Aplysia neurotrophin (NT) and transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}), contribute to development of molecular clocks underlying these complex dynamics. These results help to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of LTF and provide insights that may help design improved training protocols for induction and maintenance of LTF and long-term memory.",

    "title": "Examining oculomotor behavior in central vision loss with a gaze-contingent display",
    "content": "Patients with central vision loss due to macular degeneration (MD) must rely on their peripheral vision for tasks normally performed by the fovea. Many patients develop a preferred retinal locus (PRL), an eccentric retinal location used as a substitute for the damaged fovea in tasks such as face recognition, navigation, and reading. However, the mechanisms underlying PRL development remain elusive, and no single hypothesis fully explains its characteristics. Investigations into PRL development are hindered by oculomotor assessments, which often focus on fixation ability while neglecting other eye movement characteristics and potentially conflating different behaviors over time. In previous work, we introduced a series of oculomotor metrics in cases of simulated central vision loss, demonstrating that complex profiles of eye movement behavior can be extracted from a simple visual task. Here we present longitudinal data from 10 patients with MD as evidence of the feasibility of using these metrics to characterize different profiles of eye movements following central vision loss. Consistent with findings in healthy individuals using artificial scotoma, the metrics reveal substantial individual differences in behavior, both at baseline and after visual training. Overall, patients exhibit significantly higher saccadic re-referencing than controls, despite larger inter-individual differences. These metrics provide a detailed evaluation of oculomotor behavior in patients with central vision loss and offer a valuable tool for assessing progress in training protocols.",

    "content": "Objective. To address the limited innate regenerative capacity of neural tissues following traumatic brain injury (TBI) by developing a novel therapeutic intervention. Approach. We engineered a composite scaffold using 3D bioprinting to integrate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with collagen-heparan matrices supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), creating a 3D-CH-bFGF/NGF-MSCs construct. Main results. The engineered construct demonstrated favorable biomechanical characteristics and cytocompatibility. In rat TBI models, this intervention significantly enhanced cognitive recovery and sustained sensorimotor function restoration. Histopathological analyses revealed corresponding neural network regeneration through axonal regrowth, synaptogenesis reinforcement, and myelination enhancement at injury sites. Significance. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of a 3D-bioprinted, growth factor-enhanced MSC-scaffold construct to promote structural and functional neural repair after TBI, offering a promising strategy for neural tissue regeneration.",

    "content": "Objective. Steady-state visually evoked potential-based Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or participants of previous experiments), to the new user (target domain) using only unlabeled target data. Approach. Our method adapts the pre-trained DNN to the new user by minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and local-regularity terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and forces the DNN to assign similar labels to adjacent instances. Main results. Our method achieves excellent ITRs of 201.15\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 and 145.02\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 on the benchmark and BETA datasets, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is available at https://github.com/osmanberke/SFDA-SSVEP-BCI. Significance. The proposed method prioritizes user comfort by removing the burden of calibration while maintaining an excellent character identification accuracy and ITR. Because of these attributes, our approach could significantly accelerate the adoption of BCI systems into everyday life.",

    "content": "Objective: MicroRNAs regulate the brain vascular integrity and are involved in the lesion development of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM). This study examines the role of microRNA-21-3p in CCM-related cerebral hemorrhage and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: The expression of miRNA-21-3p and its target genes of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and pericytes were assessed in cavernous malformation lesions of 20 sporadic CCM patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The association of their expression with hemorrhage manifestation was evaluated. Cell proliferation, permeability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), migration, tubule formation, and the expression of NOX4 and VEGFA were assessed in CCM2 gene-depleted human BMECs and pericytes after miRNA-21-3p intervention. Cerebral hemorrhage, vascular permeability, vascular dilation, and angiogenesis after miRNA-21-3p intervention were evaluated in the ccm2 gene-knockdown zebrafish. Results: Decreased miRNA-21-3p and increased NOX4 and VEGFA were shown in BMECs and pericytes of the CCM lesions compared to peri-lesion normal vessels from epilepsy patients, which were also correlated with the presence of cerebral hemorrhage in CCM patients. Increasing miRNA-21-3p attenuated cell proliferation, permeability, ROS expression, cell migration, and tubule formation by targeting NOX4 and VEGFA in CCM2 gene-depleted BMECs and pericytes. In vivo studies revealed that increasing miRNA-21-3p reduced cerebral hemorrhage, vascular permeability, vascular dilation, angiogenesis, and the overexpression of nox4 and vegfa in ccm2 gene-knockdown zebrafish. Conclusion: MiRNA-21-3p can be a novel therapeutic target by regulating NOX4 and VEGFA, thereby stabilizing vascular integrity and reducing cerebral hemorrhage in CCM lesions.",

    "title": "The alternated brain states in resting state after immoral decisions",
    "content": "Immoral decisions, which engage both cognitive control and reward system, bring both cognitive and neural consequences. However, how dishonesty has an impact on the brain's dynamic alterations is still unclear. In this work, we attempt to understand the impact of immoral decisions on the brain states' dynamics using both resting-state and task-state fMRI data collected before, during, and after an information-passing task involving dishonest choices with rewards. We employed the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the changes in the brain dynamics state, in which the changes that happen between pre- and post-task are hypothesized to be linked to behavior and brain dynamics during the task. First, we identified 4 intrinsic brain states across both resting scans and task scans, including one reward state (state 1) and one control network (state 3). The fractional occupancy (FO) of the control network decreased after the task, and subsequent analysis showed that it was linked to brain dynamics during the task: as dishonesty persisted, FO of the control network decreased while FO of the reward network increased. Moreover, the post-task control network was negatively correlated with motivated dishonesty, suggesting that stronger control network recruitment counteracts immoral tendencies. In contrast, early in the task, the reward network positively correlated with motivated dishonesty, indicating that the representation and sensitivity to reward attribution were tied to dishonest choices. A complementary analysis using drift diffusion modeling confirmed that the reward network tracked the weightings placed on monetary rewards, and the level of activation of the reward network before the task is associated with a bias in dishonesty. Together, these findings suggest that the 'post-moral decision brain' operates not as a static system but as a set of dynamically shifting states, whose adaptive trajectories may underlie the lasting effect of moral erosion during sustained dishonest behavior.",

    "content": "This study proposes a novel spatiotemporal connectome-based framework to characterize the human brain's action network, namely network affinity, moving beyond traditional static temporal connectivity measures by leveraging full functional connectivity profiles on large-scale neural wave dynamics. We applied this method to map the action network for the first time in a non-Western young adult cohort from the Chinese Human Connectome Project (CHCP). Our results delineate the action network's detailed functional affinity architecture, capturing its integrative topology across the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical nuclei, and its characteristic anticorrelation with the default network. All the findings are replicated in HCP samples. Crucially, all derived high-resolution action network affinity maps and the associated computational code are publicly shared to foster open science and reproducibility (https://ccndc.scidb.cn/en). This work provides a foundational atlas and a new analytical approach, establishing a critical resource for future basic research across diverse populations and lifespans. It also holds significant translational potential for understanding and treating neurological and psychiatric disorders affecting goal-directed behavior, such as apathy and Parkinson's disease.",

    "title": "Intravenous Administration of Serotonergic Psychedelics Produce Short-lasting Changes in Sleep-Wake Behavior and High Gamma Functional Connectivity in Rats",
    "content": "Background and Purpose: Given the increase in recreational psychedelic use and ongoing efforts to explore psychedelics as therapeutic agents for mental health disorders, there is an urgent need to understand the effect of psychedelics such as psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on sleep-wake states, which share a bidirectional relationship with mental health. Here, we investigated the effects of intravenous psilocybin and DMT on sleep-wake states and EEG spectral power and functional connectivity in rats. Experimental Approach: Sprague Dawley rats (n=25, 13 male) were surgically instrumented to record high-density EEG (27 electrodes) and EMG during 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle after intravenous psilocybin (2.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg), DMT (3.75 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline. The EEG/EMG data were scored in 4-second epochs into wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. EEG spectral power and corticocortical coherence, a surrogate for functional connectivity, were computed in 12-second epochs. Key Results: Psilocybin and DMT delayed the onset of SWS and REM sleep, and caused a short-lasting increase in wakefulness and decrease in SWS. Psilocybin also produced a 1) decrease in REM sleep, 2) decrease in theta power and coherence and increase in high gamma power and coherence during wake and SWS, and 3) increase in high gamma coherence during REM sleep. DMT increased gamma coherence only during wakefulness. Conclusions and Implications: Serotonergic psychedelics have minimal effects on sleep-wake states. The enhanced high gamma functional connectivity suggests that the psychedelic-induced changes in EEG/neural dynamics can occur independent of the arousal states.",

    "title": "Developmental CA2 perineuronal net reduction restores social memory in Shank3B KO mice",
    "content": "Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental conditions, like Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS), exhibit social recognition deficits. Previous reports using Shank3B knockout (KO) mice, a genetic model with relevance to ASD and PMDS, revealed deficits in social memory in adulthood, but the postnatal onset and mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain unknown. In the hippocampus, area CA2 contributes to the emergence of social memory during development and remains important for this ability through the lifespan. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures, support social memory in CA2 and help orchestrate critical periods of plasticity in other brain regions. We found that Shank3B KO pups exhibit specific deficits in short-term social recognition and social novelty preference, which become evident at the end of the second postnatal week and persist into adulthood along with CA2 network aberrations. Excessive PNNs in area CA2 were detected in KO pups at the postnatal time when social recognition function typically emerges in healthy pups. This time was also characterized by greater sequestration of the guidance cue semaphorin-3A (sema3A) and overgrowth of afferents from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in KOs, suggesting that inordinate PNNs during a sensitive period may disorganize developing CA2 circuitry. Reduction of CA2 PNN levels prior to the onset of social dysfunction recovered social recognition function during development, as well as reduced sema3A and SuM inputs to the CA2. The restoration of behavioral function persisted into adulthood along with partial normalization of CA2 network activity. Together, these findings reveal how excess PNN formation in the developing hippocampus may give rise to impaired social memory by disrupting afferent input, effects that are reversible by early life intervention.",

    "title": "Brain-to-text decoding with context-aware neural representations and large language models",
    "content": "Objective. Decoding attempted speech from neural activity offers a promising avenue for restoring communication abilities in individuals with speech impairments. Previous studies have focused on mapping neural activity to text using phonemes as the intermediate target. While successful, decoding neural activity directly to phonemes ignores the context dependent nature of the neural activity-to-phoneme mapping in the brain, leading to suboptimal decoding performance. Approach. In this work, we propose the use of diphone\u2014an acoustic representation that captures the transitions between two phonemes\u2014as the context-aware modeling target. We integrate diphones into existing phoneme decoding frameworks through a novel divide-and-conquer strategy in which we model the phoneme distribution by marginalizing over the diphone distribution. Our approach effectively leverages the enhanced context-aware representation of diphones while preserving the manageable class size of phonemes, a key factor in simplifying the subsequent phoneme-to-text conversion task. Main results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Brain-to-Text 2024 benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art phoneme error rate (PER) of 15.34% compared to 16.62% PER of monophone-based decoding. When coupled with finetuned large language models (LLMs), our method yields a Word error rate (WER) of 5.77%, significantly outperforming the 8.93% WER of the leading method in the benchmark. Significance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging context-aware neural representations and LLMs for brain-to-text decoding, thereby expanding the capabilities of speech neuroprostheses and paving the way toward restoring communication in individuals with speech impairments.",

    "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Wen and Tobias, and we're building Metorial (<a href=\"https://metorial.com\">https://metorial.com</a>), an integration platform that connects AI agents to external tools and data using MCP.<p>The Problem: While MCP works great locally (e.g., Cursor or Claude Desktop), server-side deployments are painful. Running MCP servers means managing Docker configs, per-user OAuth flows, scaling concurrent sessions, and building observability from scratch. This infrastructure work turns simple integrations into weeks of setup.<p>Metorial handles all of this automatically. We maintain an open catalog of ~600 MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, Salesforce, databases, etc.) that you can deploy in three clicks. You can also bring your own MCP server or fork existing ones.<p>For OAuth, just provide your client ID and secret and we handle the entire flow, including token refresh. Each user then gets an isolated MCP server instance configured with their own OAuth credentials automatically.<p>What makes us different is that our serverless runtime hibernates idle MCP servers and resumes them with sub-second cold starts while preserving the state and connection. Our custom MCP engine is capable of managing thousands of concurrent connections, giving you a scalable service with per-user isolation. Other alternatives either run shared servers (security issues) or provision separate VMs per user (expensive and slow to scale).<p>Our Python and TypeScript SDKs let you connect LLMs to MCP tools in a single function call, abstracting away the protocol complexity. But if you want to dig deep, you can just use standard MCP and our REST API (<a href=\"https://metorial.com/api\">https://metorial.com/api</a>) to connect to our platform.<p>You can self-host (<a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/metorial\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/metorial</a>) or use the managed version at <a href=\"https://metorial.com\">https://metorial.com</a>.<p>So far, we see enterprise teams use Metorial to have a central integration hub for tools like Salesforce, while startups use it to cut weeks of infra work on their side when building AI agents with integrations.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07StSRNmJZ8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07StSRNmJZ8</a><p>Our Repos: Metorial: <a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/metorial\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/metorial</a>, MCP Containers: <a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/mcp-containers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/mcp-containers</a><p>SDKs: Node/TypeScript: <a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/metorial-node\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/metorial-node</a>, Python: <a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/metorial-python\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/metorial-python</a><p>We'd love to hear feedback, especially if you've dealt with deploying MCP at scale!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45580771\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45580771</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "Change detection of social cues across individuals plays an important role in human interaction. Here we investigated the automatic change detection of facial and vocal attractiveness in 19 female participants by recording ERPs. We adopted a 'deviant-standard-reverse' oddball paradigm where high- or low-attractive items were embedded as deviants in a sequence of opposite attractive standard stimuli. Both high- and low-attractive faces and voices elicited mismatch negativities (MMNs). Furthermore, low-attractive versus high-attractive items induced larger mismatch negativities in the voice condition but larger P3 amplitudes in the face condition. These data indicate that attractiveness can be automatically detected but that differences exist between facial and vocal attractiveness processing. Generally, change detection seems to work better for unattractive than attractive information possibly in line with a negativity bias.",

    "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "content": "Objective. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, encompassing a prodromal stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where patients may either progress to AD or remain stable. The objective of the work was to capture structural and functional modulations of brain structure and function relying on multimodal MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphisms, also in case of missing views, with the twofold goal of classifying AD patients versus healthy controls and detecting MCI converters. Approach. We propose a multimodal deep learning (DL)-based classification framework where a generative module employing cycle generative adversarial networks was introduced in the latent space for imputing missing data (a common issue of multimodal approaches). Explainable AI method was then used to extract input features\u2019 relevance allowing for post-hoc validation and enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. Main results. Experimental results on two tasks, AD detection and MCI conversion, showed that our framework reached competitive performance in the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of (CI [0.90, 0.95]) and (CI [0.70, 0.72]) in the two tasks, respectively. The interpretability analysis revealed gray matter modulations in cortical and subcortical brain areas typically associated with AD. Moreover, impairments in sensory-motor and visual resting state networks along the disease continuum, as well as genetic mutations defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified. Significance. Our integrative and interpretable DL approach shows promising performance for AD detection and MCI prediction while shedding light on important biological insights.",

    "content": "Objective. Brain\u2013computer interfaces hold significant promise for restoring communication in individuals with partial or complete loss of the ability to speak due to paralysis from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, and other neurological disorders. Many of the approaches to speech decoding reported in the BCI literature have required time-aligned target representations to allow successful training\u2014a major challenge when translating such approaches to people who have already lost their voice. Approach. In this pilot study, we made a first step toward scenarios in which no ground truth is available. We utilized a graph-based clustering approach to identify temporal segments of speech production from electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals alone. We then used the estimated speech segments to train a voice activity detection (VAD) model using only ECoG signals. We evaluated our approach using a leave-one-day-out cross-validation on open-loop recordings of a single dysarthric clinical trial participant living with ALS, and we compared the resulting performance to previous solutions trained with ground truth acoustic voice recordings. Main results. Our approach achieves a median timing error of around 530 ms with respect to the actual spoken speech. Embedded into a real-time BCI, our approach is capable of providing VAD results with a latency of only 10 ms. Significance. To the best of our knowledge, our results show for the first time that speech activity can be predicted purely from unlabeled ECoG signals, a crucial step toward individuals who cannot provide this information anymore due to their neurological condition, such as patients with locked-in syndrome.

    "title": "Physiological activity within peripheral nerves influences neural output in response to electrical stimulation: an in vivo study",
    "content": "Objective. Neuromodulation therapies are often applied to peripheral nerves. These nerves can have physiological activity that interacts with the activity evoked by electrical stimulation, potentially influencing targeted neural output and clinical outcomes. Our goal was to quantify changes in sensory neural unit activity in response to variations in electrical stimulation frequency and amplitude. Approach. In a feline model, we applied cutaneous brushing to evoke pudendal nerve afferent activity with and without electrical stimulation via a pudendal nerve cuff electrode. We recorded neural output with microelectrode arrays implanted in ipsilateral sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Main results. Combined inter-spike interval distributions for all DRG units showed ranges of flattening, increases, and shifts in response to electrical stimulation. These distributions and changes within them due to electrical stimulation were largely driven by a select few units. Mixed-effects models revealed that quicker firing units generally decreased in firing rate in response to electrical stimulation and, conversely, slower firing units increased in firing rate. A unit\u2019s underlying firing rate also drove the magnitude of change in mean output firing rate in response to stimulation. Further, the models reported a small, negative correlation between the output mean unit firing rate and the applied electrical stimulation frequency. Significance. These results demonstrate the potential impact of electrical stimulation on underlying neural firing activity and output. Peripheral neuromodulation may normalize abnormal firing patterns in nerves contributing to pathological disorders or alter unrelated physiological activity in off-target neurons. These factors should be considered when selecting neuromodulation settings in animal subjects and human patients.",

    "content": "Objective. Intracortical microstimulation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1-ICMS) is being developed to provide on-line feedback for bidirectional brain\u2013machine interfaces. Because S1-ICMS can alter the discharge of the motor cortex neurons used to decode motor intent, successful application of S1-ICMS feedback requires understanding the modulation it produces in motor cortex neuron activity. Approach. We investigated the effects of S1-ICMS on neurons in both the primary motor cortex (M1) and the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) during a task in which some trials were instructed with visual cues and other trials with S1-ICMS. Main results. We observed both indirect modulation during and/or after ICMS trains, as well as direct modulation time-locked to the individual S1-ICMS pulses within trains, with all possible combinations of the two types of modulation found among the majority of M1 and PMv neurons. Indirect effects were more prevalent and larger than direct effects. When S1-ICMS produced both indirect and direct modulation in the same neuron, the effects could both be excitatory, both inhibitory, or one excitatory and the other inhibitory. By simulating direct effects, we isolated the concurrent indirect effects, revealing that isolated direct effects failed to account for isolated indirect effects. Furthermore, indirect effects could be present 1 s or more after ICMS trains had terminated, when no direct effects could have occurred. Although the performance of movement decoders trained on visually-instructed trials was poor when applied to ICMS-instructed trials, decoders trained on ICMS-instructed trials performed well on ICMS-instructed trials, indicating that S1-ICMS altered the discharge of M1 and PMv neurons but did not degrade the decodable information available. Significance. When decoding movement intent from neural activity in M1 and/or PMv, accounting for indirect and direct modulation may improve the ability of bidirectional brain\u2013machine interfaces to incorporate artificial somatosensory feedback delivered with S1-ICMS and restore functional movement.",

    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) has evolved into an indispensable instrument for estimating cognitive workload in various domains. Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly employed to develop accurate workload estimation and classification models based on EEG data. The goal of this systematic review is to compile the body of research on EEG workload estimation and classification using ML and DL approaches. Methods. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures were followed in conducting the review, searches were conducted through databases at SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Science Direct from the beginning to the end of 16 February 2024. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted to capture study design, participant demographics, EEG features, ML/DL algorithms, and reported performance metrics. Results. Out of the 125 items that emerged, 33 scientific papers were fully evaluated. The study designs, participant demographics, and EEG workload measurement and categorization techniques used in the investigations differed. Support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and hybrid networks are examples of ML and DL approaches that were often used. Analyzing the accuracy scores achieved by different ML/DL models. Furthermore, a relationship was noted between sample frequency and model accuracy, with higher sample frequencies generally leading to improved performance. The percentage distribution of ML/DL methods revealed that SVMs, CNNs, and recurrent neural networks were the most commonly utilized techniques, reflecting their robustness in handling EEG data. Significance. The comprehensive review emphasizes how ML may be used to identify mental workload across a variety of disciplines using EEG data. Optimizing practical applications requires multimodal data integration, standardization efforts, and real-world validation studies. These systems will also be further improved by addressing ethical issues and investigating new EEG properties, which will improve human\u2013computer interaction and performance assessment.",

    "title": "Identification of modulated whole-brain dynamical models from nonstationary electrophysiological data",
    "content": "Objective. Understanding the mechanisms underlying brain dynamics is a long-held goal in neuroscience. However, these dynamics are both individualized and nonstationary, making modeling challenging. Here, we present a data-driven approach to modeling nonstationary dynamics based on principles of neuromodulation, at the level of individual subjects. Approach. Previously, we developed the mesoscale individualized neural dynamics (MINDy) modeling approach to capture individualized brain dynamics which do not change over time. Here, we extend the MINDy approach by adding a modulatory component which is multiplied by a set of baseline, stationary connectivity weights. We validate this model on both synthetic data and publicly available electroencephalography data in the context of anesthesia, a known modulator of neural dynamics. Main results. We find that our modulated MINDy approach is accurate, individualized, and reliable. Additionally, we find that our models yield biologically interpretable inferences regarding the effects of propofol anesthesia on mesoscale cortical networks, consistent with previous literature on the neuromodulatory effects of propofol. Significance. Ultimately, our data-driven modeling approach is reliable and scalable, and provides insight into mechanisms underlying observed brain dynamics. Our modeling methodology can be used to infer insights about modulation dynamics in the brain in a number of different contexts.",

    "title": "Cognitive performance fatigability, perceived fatigability, and trait fatigue in post-COVID-19 condition: A cross-sectional study.",
    "content": "Objective: Earlier research on fatigue in post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) has mainly studied subjective fatigue, either over a prolonged period (trait fatigue) or in relation to a certain situation (state fatigue) in the form of perceived fatigability. Another aspect of state fatigue, cognitive performance fatigability, defined as a decline in performance over time in cognitively demanding tasks, has not been the focus of PCC research. We aimed to examine performance fatigability and the associations between these three fatigue domains. Method: Thirty-four individuals with PCC and 36 controls who recovered from COVID-19 without PCC performed cognitive tests repeated twice during the test session to assess performance fatigability. Self-reports were used to assess perceived fatigability (repeated Visual Analogue Scales) and trait fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory). Results: Analysis of covariance showed significant interactions in two tests measuring processing speed: coding (<em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = .17) and a speed composite score derived from Color\u2013Word Interference Test (<em>p</em> = .031, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = .08), where the controls improved their performance more on the repeated tests compared with the PCC group, indicating performance fatigability in the PCC group. For the PCC group, no correlations were found between fatigue domains (<em>r</em> < 0.34). Conclusions: The PCC group exhibited performance fatigability in measures of processing speed. There were no correlations between fatigue domains, suggesting that the domains might represent separate constructs. The results highlight the need to differentiate between various types of fatigue in research and clinical practice and to assess performance fatigability in addition to using self-reports to obtain a comprehensive understanding of fatigue and fatigability.

    "content": "Objective: Initial findings indicate that semantic memory retrieval of different categories, such as fruits and animals, is variably impacted in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Importantly, theories of embodied cognition propose that these variances may stem from compromised motor processing in PD patients. Indeed, the conceptual representation of the fruits category may involve aspects of manipulability and graspability, which are less relevant for the animals category. We aimed to assess semantic memory retrieval of fruits versus animals category as assessed by semantic fluency (SF) in PD by using the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Marker Initiative database. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 104 healthy controls (HC), 264 patients with sporadic de novo PD (S-PD), and 57 patients with genetic PD (G-PD). Additionally, we carried out explorative analysis concerning possible differences between S-PD and G-PF on SF. Results: We found lower fruits SF performance in PD (S-PD plus G-PD) compared to HC; however, this score could not classify the two groups. Crucially, no difference for the animals class was found. When analyzing separately S-PD and G-PD, we found that fruits SF in S-PD was lower compared to HC and was negatively associated with S-PD diagnosis. Remarkably, no difference for the animals class was found. We did not find significant SF differences in the G-PD. Moreover, SF scores, regardless of the category, were uncorrelated with dopamine integrity measures and motor symptoms scales. Conclusions: The findings reveal distinct patterns of category dissociation in S-PD and G-PD, suggesting a potential link between category dissociation and motor embodiment processes in PD.

    "content": "Objective: The Modified Taylor Complex Figure\u2013Recognition Trial (MTCF-RT) is a visual recognition memory measure that consists of a recognition trial to be administered after the copy and the delayed reproduction of the Modified Taylor Complex Figure Test. The aim of this study was to validate the MTCF-RT in differentiating amnestic patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) from patients with memory deficits due to Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) or subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD). Method: The MTCF-RT was administered to 25 amnestic patients with AD and 25 patients with memory deficits due to SIVD (<em>n</em> = 18) or PD (<em>n</em> = 7). Additionally, the recognition trial was administered to 40 neurologically unimpaired individuals. All patients were tested on a brief neuropsychological battery, and their magnetic resonance scans were assessed for medial temporal lobe atrophy. Results: MTCF-RT performance was significantly lower in the group of amnestic patients with AD than in the group of amnestic patients with non-AD disorders, whereas healthy subjects performed significantly better than the two experimental groups. The MTCF-RT allowed identifying amnestic patients with AD with 92% sensitivity and 96% specificity using a cutoff of \u22647.358, showing a higher discriminant power with respect to other long-term memory measures. Finally, MTCF-RT scores showed a high negative correlation with medial temporal lobe atrophy and a positive correlation with other long-term memory measures. Conclusions: MTCF-RT could be a useful tool, as part of a larger neuropsychological battery, for discriminating patients with AD from those with memory deficits due to PD or SIVD.

    "content": "Objective: The treatment of dementia is increasingly likely to focus on dementia-related biomarkers. Unfortunately, there is variability with regard to biomarker-related effects. This analysis tests an algorithm capable of identifying persons adversely impacted by any dementia-related biomarker in this case, amyloidopathy as estimated by positron emission tomography (PET). Method: <em>N</em> = 1,737 subjects of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative were assigned to amyloidopathy-affliction classes. Moderation effects were tested by chi-square difference. Results: 39.3% of subjects with (+) PET results were assigned to the afflicted class. The afflicted subjects had greater dementia severity and higher amyloid burdens. These effects persisted at 36 months. Furthermore, the association between amyloid burden and dementia severity was moderated by affliction class. Afflicted nondemented cases with positive PET findings were more likely to convert to clinical \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d over 48 months, by Cox\u2019s<em> F: F</em>(312, 154) = 1.27, <em>p</em> = .05. PET assessed amyloid burden was not related to dementia severity in resilient PET (+) cases. Conclusion: Our approach could allow for more accurate prediction of biomarker effects and guide precision interventions against specific biomarkers.

    "title": "Semantic processing in subjective cognitive decline: An eye-tracking study.",
    "content": "Objectives: Alzheimer\u2019s disease progresses through several stages, starting with a preclinical phase characterized by subjective cognitive decline (SCD), where individuals express concerns about their memory despite normal cognitive test results. Recent research has indicated subtle semantic difficulties in SCD, prompting the need for a deeper investigation into cognitive processing during this phase. This study aimed to investigate the cognitive processing of famous and unfamiliar faces in individuals with SCD compared to healthy controls, focusing on semantic memory deficits assessment. Method: Twenty-seven participants with SCD and 26 control participants performed a judgment task involving famous and unfamiliar faces while their eye movements were recorded. Mean fixation times, number of revisitations, and number of fixations were analyzed between the two groups. Results: The SCD group exhibited no significant differences in mean fixation times and in the number of revisited regions between famous and unfamiliar faces, in contrast to the control group, which showed distinct patterns in processing these categories of stimuli. Conclusion: These findings suggest that individuals with SCD process famous faces similarly to unfamiliar faces, indicating a potential weakening of semantic processing in SCD. This may have implications for early detection of cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "BDNF-TrkB signaling promotes synaptic GluN2A-NMDA receptor expression and network hyperexcitability in cultured hippocampal neurons and during status epilepticus",
    "content": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key modulator of synaptic function, acting through activation of TrkB receptors. This neurotrophic factor mediates synaptic plasticity and plays an important role in epileptogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this work, we investigated the role of BDNF-TrkB signaling in the regulation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors (NMDAR), and the impact on network synchronization in cultured hippocampal neurons . Incubation with BDNF increased the synaptic surface expression of GluN2A-containing NMDAR in rat hippocampal synaptoneurosomes and in cultured hippocampal neurons. The effect in the latter preparation was time- dependent and required new protein synthesis. Mechanistically, we identified a signaling cascade involving hnRNPK, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2, and protein kinase C (PKC) as essential for mediating BDNF - induced upregulation in the synaptic expression of GluN2A-containing NMDAR. Knockdown of hnRNPK or Pyk2, pharmacological inhibition of PKC, or expression of a phosphorylation -deficient Pyk2 mutant abolished BDNF-induced synaptic surface accumulation of Glu2A. Moreover, Pyk2 phosphorylation at Y402 was necessary for both basal and BDNF-induced synaptic GluN2A expression. Functional multielectrode array (MEA) recordings showed that endogenous BDNF and GluN2A-containing NMDAR contributed to the increase in network activity in cultured hippocampal neurons evoked by stimulation with a cocktail including bicuculline, 4-aminopyridine, and glycine. Importantly, BDNF-TrkB signaling also mediated the upregulation in the hippocampal synaptic surface expression of GluN2A -containing NMDAR, as determined in rats subjected to the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy, where increased GluN2A synaptic expression was observed and shown to be TrkB-dependent. These findings unveil a crucial BDNF/TrkB-PKC-Pyk2-hnRNPK signaling axis that regulates synaptic GluN2A levels and network excitability, offering novel insights into the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity.",

    "title": "Targeted Intestinal Cooling Offers Superior Brain Protection in the Mouse Stroke Model",
    "content": "Background: Intestinal immune and inflammatory response plays a detrimental role following a stroke. This study aims to evaluate the brain protective efficacies of a novel intestinal cooling (CC) technique relative to the body surface cooling (SC) and the normothermic (NT) condition in a mouse stroke model. Methods: Mice were randomly assigned to CC (n=13), SC (n=15), or NT (n=11) groups. They underwent 60 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 7-day reperfusion. Both head and intra-colon temperatures were maintained at 37{degrees}C for 30 min before, during, and 30 min after MCAO. At 30 min reperfusion, a cooling catheter was placed to maintain intra-colon at 37{degrees}C in NT or 12{degrees}C in CC. The head temperature was maintained at 37{degrees}C in NT and 30{degrees}C in CC. In SC, both intra-colon and head temperatures were maintained at 30{degrees}C. Cooling lasted 3 hours. Bodyweight, behavioral deficits (nesting and pole test), and survival rate were assessed post-MCAO. At day 7 post-MCAO, mice were perfusion-fixed for histopathological analysis. Results: Post-stroke histopathological brain injury areas and volume were significantly reduced in CC, and appeared reduced though not statistically significant in SC, relative to NT. Compared with NT, body weight, nest building activity, and pole test were all significantly recovered in CC post-MCAO. In SC, only nest building improved significantly, while body weight and pole test showed marginal, nonsignificant trends. Consistent with functional recovery, survival was significantly improved in CC but not in SC, compared with NT. Conclusion: In a murine model, our novel CC technique successfully achieved targeted intestinal cooling while preserving safe upper-body temperatures necessary for normal cardiopulmonary function. Targeted intestinal cooling provides significant benefits superior to SC and NT, including smaller stroke volume, fewer functional deficits, and lower mortality rates, thus supporting the novel concept that the intestines are potential therapeutic targets for stroke management.",

    "title": "Ecological cues orchestrate concerted courtship in a Drosophila host specialist",
    "content": "Mating decisions are often attributed to the sensory signaling between prospective sexual partners. Yet these interactions are also shaped by the broader environmental context in which they unfold, to appropriately align sexual arousal with reproductive opportunities. Here we show that in the host specialist Drosophila erecta mating is strictly contingent on the ecological and social environment generated as flies densely aggregate on a food patch. We find that food volatiles directly promote male sexual arousal, triggering individuals to sample and pursue potential mates, giving rise to dynamic interactions across the group. The ensuing visual motion transforms each male's visual field, which in turn further amplifies his arousal, generating a multisensory feedback loop that coordinately promotes courtship across individuals. D.erecta's strict dependence on environmental cues appears latent in related species, such as D. melanogaster, where food odor can promote arousal but is dispensable for vigorous courtship. Comparative circuit analyses reveal that species-specific thresholds for sexual arousal reflect variation in how olfactory input modulates conserved nodes controlling courtship drive, rendering food volatiles a strict sensory gate only in D. erecta. Together, our findings highlight how ecological cues not directly tied to sexual signaling can profoundly influence reproductive behavior and reorganize the social landscape to ensure mating occurs in contexts where reproductive opportunities are abundant.",

    "content": "Nightmare Distress Questionnaire (NDQ) is commonly used to assess nightmare distress. The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Flying dreams stimulated by targeted movement and sound: Art and science in the dream hotel.",
    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "title": "Nightmare disorder in women.",
    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

    "title": "Neural Phoneme Processing in Children with and without Dyslexia",
    "content": "This study investigates the neural dynamics of phoneme processing in 7-year-old children with and without dyslexia (25;9 male), using EEG recordings collected during continuous speech listening. By applying temporal generalization to phonetic descriptor decoding, we can disentangle whether potential phoneme processing deficits are due to the maintenance of phonemes in verbal short-term memory and/or inferred differences in phonetic processing speed, both of which are thought to be impaired in dyslexia. We investigated whether phonetic processing depends on the phoneme's position or its lexical competition. Our results reveal two key findings that may help explain the challenges faced by children with dyslexia. First, these children exhibit reduced decoding accuracy for word-onset phonemes, suggesting disruptions in either predictive, word-level anticipatory mechanisms or in the intrinsic rhythmic processing aligned with word boundaries. Second, they exhibit increased decoding accuracy for non-onset phonemes with low lexical competition approximately 400 ms after phoneme onset. This pattern suggests that children with dyslexia retain linguistically less relevant sounds longer in verbal short-term memory and process them more slowly compared to their typical reading peers. Together, these findings suggest that dyslexia is characterized by altered phonetic encoding strategies, specifically inefficient prioritization of relevant phonological information. This work provides new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying phonological deficits and contributes to a deeper understanding of the cognitive basis of dyslexia.",

Especially salient and ubiquitous among these variables are time, space, and reward, but how they are simultaneously represented throughout the neocortex and the entorhinal cortex is not well understood. Here, we devised a behavioral task in virtual reality that includes timing, navigation, and reward components and, using a multifocus microscope that permits simultaneous mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging of neocortex and entorhinal cortex, we uncover dedicated and distinct subnetworks for interval timing, spatial navigation, and reward. Interestingly, the timing subnetwork includes a strong contribution from barrel cortex, pointing towards a previously unknown role for this cortex in interval timing.",

    "title": "Hippocampal transformations occur along dimensions of memory interference",
    "content": "The role of the hippocampus in resolving memory interference has been greatly elucidated by considering the relationship between the similarity of visual stimuli (input) and corresponding similarity of hippocampal activity patterns (output). However, these input-output functions can take surprisingly different forms. Here, we reconcile seemingly conflicting findings by considering the possibility that the hippocampus prioritizes different dimensions of visual similarity across different stages of learning. First, we generated a set of natural scene images from two visual categories and rigorously characterized visual similarity using a wide array of methods: neural networks, artificial intelligence models, and human perceptual and memory decisions. We then identified two orthogonal dimensions of visual similarity that each predicted memory interference, but that did so at distinct stages of learning. Using high-resolution fMRI, we then tested for dimension-specific input-output functions within the hippocampus. Within CA3 and dentate gyrus (CA3/DG), we show that dimensions of visual similarity were inverted (negative functions) at stages of learning when they contributed to memory interference. When the dimensions did not contribute to interference, functions were positive. These findings reveal that hippocampal representations of visually-similar stimuli are highly dynamic and critically depend on the dimensions of similarity that currently contribute to memory interference.",

Here, we present a population-level single-cell spatial transcriptomic atlas of human cortices from 71 donors across the lifespan. We identified 906 layer-specific genes showing conserved and divergent laminar expression patterns between humans and other species. Spatial analysis revealed neuronal vulnerability and glial activation during aging, together with a decline in the proportion of superficial SST neurons and their interactions with other cells. Disease-associated genes exhibited high cell-type and layer-specific expression, implicating the pathogenic role of spatially specific gene expression. Spatial cis-eQTL analysis identified regulatory variants linked to genes related to diseases like Tourette syndrome. Cross-species comparison demonstrated glial expansion in the human cortex, accompanied by enhanced neuron-glia communication via the neuregulin signaling. Together, we provide a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the human cortex that is essential for understanding aging, evolution, and disease pathogenesis.",

    "content": "Within the framework of a \u201cneurofilmological\u201d approach \u2013 which integrates film studies, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience \u2013 the present study explored how cinematographic editing influences the viewer\u2019s perception of time. Previous behavioral research has shown that editing density affects temporal judgments. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship, we examined the role of motor system activity, specifically the supplementary motor area (SMA), in time perception when individuals are exposed to moving images with different cinematographic editing styles. Forty-eight university students were assigned to one of three tDCS conditions (anodal, cathodal, or sham). They viewed nine silent video clips with different editing styles (master shot, slow-paced, fast-paced) that were specifically created for research. The participants rated perceived duration, time passage, action speed, and emotional engagement, while tDCS was applied for 20 min targeting the SMA. The results revealed that SMA excitability modulation affected duration estimates, time passage, and action speed judgments by interacting with the editing style of the clips. These findings highlight the importance of the SMA in modulating time perception during film viewing. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms that shape the viewer\u2019s perception of film time as an integral part of experiencing movement in cinema.",

The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a strategy-based cognitive training program (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Training) to improve executive function and related outcomes in young women with stroke.MethodsEight women with chronic-stage stroke (age: M = 38.75 years; SD = \u00b1 8.78) and eight age- and education-matched controls (age: M = 35.75 years; SD \u00b1 7.71) completed 10 sessions of SMART over 5 weeks, with pre- and post- training assessments. Outcomes included measures of executive function (subtests of the BrainHealth Index), daily living skills (Cognitive Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Daily Living Questionnaire, and Community Integration Questionnaire), and psychosocial functioning (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21), as well as feasibility/goodness of fit of the program (Acceptability of Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure, and Feasibility of Intervention Measure).ResultsFollowing SMART, participants with stroke demonstrated improvements in aspects of executive function (including abstraction, strategic memory, and fluency of ideas), cognitive self-efficacy, and stress. Control participants also demonstrated gains, particularly in cognitive self-efficacy. Feasibility was rated highly by participants with stroke.DiscussionFindings support SMART as a promising intervention for enhancing cognitive and functional outcomes in young women with stroke, warranting further large-scale investigation.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "content": "ObjectiveInsomnia (ID) is the most common clinical disorder afflicting people of all ages, races, and social classes. This study was to explore changes in the brain\u2019s nervous system of insomnia patients after TMS treatment and construct a prognostic prediction model.MethodThis study involved collecting EEG data of 15 patients before and after treatment, extracting features (approximate entropy, sample entropy, alignment entropy, power spectral density, median, mean, kurtosis, and skewness), and building an SVR model.ResultsFifteen subjects (8 females, 7 males, mean age 42\u202fyears) received 7\u202fdays of TMS on the right prefrontal lobe. Five eigenvalues were used to analyze EEG data in 5 frequency bands. Statistically significant indicator eigenvalues (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Paired t-test showed significant differences in PSQI and ISI total scores before and after TMS treatment, indicating its therapeutic effect. Correlation coefficients between 40 indicators and scale differences were calculated, and significant characteristic values were further analyzed. SVR models for predicting ISI and PSQI scale pre-post differences were constructed. Both had predictive ability.ConclusionThis work proposes the first SVR model leveraging pre-treatment EEG features to predict TMS therapeutic outcomes for insomnia. TMS treatment can change brain waves, and the model is expected to be applied clinically, though with limitations such as small sample size and insufficiently detailed brain region division.",

Robot-assisted training (RT) is a promising therapy in stroke rehabilitation, but for the elderly, traditional 'reaching objects'\" tasks do not seem to create sufficient motivation, an important factor in rehabilitation, which reduces the effect of rehabilitation. Combining RT with some popular card games like mahjong, a popular tiled-based game in the Chinese elderly, is a strategy...",
