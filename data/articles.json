The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares.

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "title": "KF/parabrachial complex PACAP - glutamate pathway to the extended amygdala couples rapid autonomic and delayed endocrine responses to acute hypotension",
    "content": "The calyx of Held is a giant axo-somatic synapse classically confined to the auditory brainstem. We recently identified morphologically similar calyx-like terminals in the extended amygdala (EA) that arise from the ventrolateral parabrachial complex and co-express PACAP, CGRP, VAChT, VGluT1, and VGluT2, targeting PKCdelta+/GluD1+ EA neurons. Here we asked whether this parabrachial - EA pathway participates in compensation during acute hypotension. In rats given hydralazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), we quantified Fos protein during an early phase (60 min) and a late phase (120 min). Early after hypotension, Fos surged in a discrete subpopulation of the parabrachial Kolliker - Fuse (KF) region and in the EA, whereas magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (SON/PVN) remained largely silent. By 120 min, magnocellular SON/PVN neurons were robustly Fos-positive. Confocal immunohistochemistry showed that most Fos+ PKCdelta/GluD1 EA neurons were encircled by PACAP+ perisomatic terminals (80.8%), of which the majority co-expressed VGluT1 (88.1%). RNAscope in situ hybridization further identified a selective KF population co-expressing Adcyap1 (PACAP) and Slc17a7 (VGluT1) that became Fos-positive during the early phase. Together these data indicate that a KFPACAP/VGluT1 projection forms calyceal terminals around PKCdelta/GluD1 EA neurons, providing a high-fidelity route for rapid autonomic rebound to falling blood pressure, while slower endocrine support is subsequently recruited via vasopressinergic magnocellular activation. This work links multimodal parabrachial output to temporally layered autonomic - neuroendocrine control.",

    "content": "Social interaction is inherently asymmetric, requiring coordinated activity between non-homologous brain regions across individuals. However, the brain-wide dynamics underlying such inter-brain coordination remain poorly understood. We used multi-fiber photometry to simultaneously record from 24 brain regions in pairs of freely interacting mice, including a model of autism. Social interactions evoked widespread, dynamic activity across brains, with inter-brain synchrony, especially between non-homologous areas, exceeding intra-brain synchrony, particularly in dominant mice. Network analysis revealed three subnetworks: (1) Emotional, intra-brain enhanced in subordinates; (2) Sensory, spanning both mice; (3) Decision/consolidation, linking dominant prefrontal cortex to subordinate hippocampus. These subnetworks encoded dominance, identity, and interaction roles, and followed a clear temporal sequence around social events. In an autism model, socially evoked activity was hyperactive displaying mostly within brain synchrony but lacked inter-brain synchrony. Our results uncover dynamic inter-brain circuits as a hallmark of social behavior and reveal their disruption in autism.",

    "title": "Sustained alpha oscillations serve attentional prioritization in working memory, not maintenance",
    "content": "Recent theory on the neural basis of working memory (WM) has attributed an important role to \"activity-silent\" mechanisms, suggesting that sustained neural activity might not be essential in the retention of information. This idea has been challenged by reports of ongoing neural activity in the alpha band during WM maintenance, however. The precise role of these alpha oscillations is unclear: Do they reflect attentional prioritization of stored information, or do they serve as a general maintenance mechanism, for instance to periodically refresh synaptic traces? To address this, we designed a visual WM task involving two memory items, one of which was prioritized for recall. The task included both a short (1 s) and a long (3 s) delay intervals between encoding and retrieval. The long delay was implemented to provide a more decisive test of WM maintenance, providing a point in time when any initially silent synaptic traces would likely need to be refreshed as well. Time-resolved decoding analyses revealed that both prioritized and deprioritized items were initially decodable following stimulus presentation. However, only the prioritized item exhibited sustained decodability throughout the delay, particularly in the long delay condition, where it transitioned into a stable coding scheme. This prolonged representation was selectively supported by induced alpha power, which reliably tracked the prioritized item, but not the deprioritized one. Impulse-based decoding further confirmed this asymmetry, highlighting a selective reactivation of the deprioritized item only upon contextual relevance. Together, these findings suggest that sustained alpha-band activity reflects attentional prioritization, rather than general memory maintenance. Unattended, non-prioritized items appear to transition into an activity-silent state, consistent with models of synaptic storage in WM.",

    "content": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is one of the most widely used techniques across basic, translational, and clinical sciences. Key considerations need to be made to achieve reliable and robust IHC staining, however what has been understudied is the stability of IHC signal intensity over time. Changes in signal intensity over time have significant implications for data analysis and interpretation and ultimately impact scientific conclusions. In order to explore changes in IHC signal, the stability of fluorescence intensity was assessed over the course of six weeks using widefield or confocal microscopy. Results indicate that fluorescence intensity can decrease over this time course and that whether this decrease occurs and to what extent is influenced by the selection of the primary antibody as well as that of the secondary antibody, primary-secondary antibody combination, and utilization of chemical staining versus IHC staining. This investigation reinforces best practices for imaging fluorescent staining to ensure accurate and reliable data collection, be it for cell counting, assessing protein expression levels, or marker colocalization.",

    "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "In recent years, participant engagement initiatives in research on implanted neural devices have significantly increased. However, there remains little consensus on the motivations, goals, and best practices for engagement efforts. Drawing on the concept of participatory epistemic injustice, we argue that one core ethical motivation for engagement is epistemic in nature. Based on their subject positions, participants should be key knowledge contributors to implanted neurotech research....",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

    "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks). As is usual in oddball paradigms, the P3b was much larger for trials in the rare category than for trials in the frequent category (see Figure 2).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1256\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/89260e9e-be6e-48b1-adc4-58b77a418deb/Figure_3.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1996\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 3</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">The main question was whether the location of the dot was encoded in working memory better for the oddball trials than for the standard trials. To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "Establishment of spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 model mice accompanied by early glial activation and degeneration of cerebellar neurons",
    "content": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 (SCA34) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease primarily characterized by progressive cerebellar atrophy and ataxia, frequently accompanied by cognitive dysfunction and erythrokeratodermia variabilis. In 2014, missense mutations in the gene encoding elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4) were identified as the causative gene for SCA34. ELOVL4, which is involved in the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, ELOVL4 is highly expressed in the cerebellum compared to other brain regions, with predominant expression in neurons. We attempted to establish a mouse model of SCA34 by expressing mutant ELOVL4 in cerebellar neurons using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and to elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Expression of W246G mutant ELOVL4 successfully induced progressive motor dysfunction beginning at two weeks post-AAV vector injection. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells and neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) paralleled the observed motor decline. Importantly, microglial activation was detected in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortices and the DCN prior to the onset of both neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction. Furthermore, after the onset of motor symptoms, the SCA34 model mice exhibited decreased synaptic inputs from climbing fibers to Purkinje cells, as well as reduce inputs from Purkinje cells to DCN neurons. These findings suggest that early microglial activation and the resulting synaptic disturbance are critical preceding events that lead to the progressive cerebellar neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction observed in this SCA34 mouse model.",

    "content": "Mutation in paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) is used as the diagnostic marker of Haddad syndrome (HS). The mutant gene/protein afflict neural crest cells during embryonic development which leads to congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). Previous studies on HS and CCHS have mainly focused on the conformational dynamics of the mutant protein and have remained controversial. Here we performed RNA-sequencing on the patient derived neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs), pertinent to the neurodevelopmental phenotype in HS, and found that the PHOX2B-PARM has a profound impact on the transcriptional profile of the cells. The single copy of PHOX2B-PARM in heterozygote cells were leading to >10 fold differentially expressed genes. In the patient cells there was a significant enrichment of genes related to neuronal development and synapse organization mainly driven by L1CAM interactions and synaptogenesis signaling pathway. Our result not only highlight the use of a suitable model of HS but also provide a clear path for future experimental validation and downstream targets with potential therapeutic values.",

    "title": "Increased attentive use leads to more idiosyncratic functional connections",
    "content": "Experience is thought to modify neural connections to adapt the network to be more optimal for the environment. Given the brains complexity, multiple network changes could each move the system toward optimality. Standard methods ignore this multiplicity and examine each connection independently; these studies have often shown considerable inter-individual variability and modest effects (1). Here, we take a different strategy, determining how a whole-brain connection pattern differs from the typical pattern, that is, how idiosyncratic the pattern is. We examined how the idiosyncrasy of whole brain connection patterns varies with frequency of the use of that part of cortex for attention-demanding tasks, focusing on central versus peripheral vision in healthy individuals (where individuals use central vision more frequently for attention-demanding tasks). We found that the whole-brain pattern of functional connections to the cortical representations of central vision is idiosyncratic, whereas patterns of connections to representations of peripheral vision were very similar person-to-person. In a second set of analyses, we examined the brains of people with central vision loss who use a portion of peripheral vision (called the preferred retinal locus) more frequently for attention-demanding tasks in their daily lives. The cortical representation of the preferred retinal locus exhibits more idiosyncratic connections, compared to a control brain region, or compared to the same brain region in matched control participants with healthy vision. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased attentive use of a brain area results in idiosyncratic patterns of whole brain connections.",

    "title": "Cingulate-centered flexible control: physiologic correlates and enhancement by internal capsule stimulation",
    "content": "The flexible deployment of cognitive control is essential for adaptive functioning in dynamic environments given limited cognitive resources. That flexibility depends on rapid detection and resolution of control-prediction errors (CPEs) when current demands diverge from the control plan. Deficits in control and control flexibility are common in psychiatric disorders, yet targeted interventions are limited by incomplete circuit-level understanding and limited means for modulating control circuits . We analyzed two intracranial electroencephalography datasets (one with brief internal capsule stimulation, ICS) to identify a human neurocomputational mechanism for CPE resolution and to test its modifiability. A third dataset of patients receiving internal capsule deep brain stimulation (IC DBS) assessed clinical relevance of modifying CPE-related processes. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) anchored to the {theta} phase of right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC-R), especially {theta}- coupling between rACC-R and nodes of the cognitive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC; dorsal ACC, dACC), was associated with faster CPE resolution. An adaptive drift-diffusion model indicated that ICS improves control flexibility specifically under high CPE, and mediation analyses showed that this behavioral improvement is mediated by CPE-dependent increases in rACC-R {theta}-centered PAC. In a psychiatric cohort (N=14; primarily treatment-resistant depression, TRD) with IC DBS, enhanced control flexibility, rather than CPE-independent general cognitive control, was strongly associated with clinical response (AUC = 0.90), suggesting both a behavioral flexibility index and rACC-R PAC as candidate biomarkers for DBS optimization. These findings identify a rACC-centered, {theta} phase-based coordination of the cognitive control network as a neurocomputational substrate of flexible control. They demonstrate that capsule stimulation selectively augments this substrate when flexibility is required, and establish flexibility, rather than general control, as the feature that tracks therapeutic benefit in TRD. Together, they suggest actionable biomarkers to guide, personalize, and potentially enable closed-loop neuromodulation for disorders marked by cognitive rigidity.",

    "title": "Time-Dependent Facilitation of Homologous Actions",
    "content": "Unimanual actions can interfere with or facilitate similar actions performed with the opposite hand, especially when in close temporal proximity. Across three sequential button-press experiments, we tested how effector homology - anatomical similarity between fingers - and temporal delays between actions shape these effects. Specifically, we examined whether a priming action altered the reaction time (RT) of a subsequent action. Compared with unimanual RTs, we indexed slowing of the RT from the second action as interference, and quickening as facilitation. Priming with homologous actions (e.g., index finger-index finger) produced interference at short intervals ([&le;] 200ms) but transitioned to facilitation at longer intervals ([&ge;] 400ms). Priming with non-homologous actions (e.g., little finger-index finger) also produced interference at short intervals, but never resulted in facilitation. Critically, these patterns emerged whether the priming actions were performed with the opposite or the same hand, indicating that interference and facilitation do not depend on interhemispheric dynamics. Our results reveal a previously undocumented time-dependent shift from interference to facilitation that is specific to homologous actions, challenging models that explain the interference between parallel actions solely by competitive interhemispheric dynamics or central bottleneck processes. We propose that facilitation and interference flexibly coexist, and are shaped by effector homology and timing. These findings extend current models of bimanual coordination and highlight new opportunities for enhancing motor performance and neurorehabilitation.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "title": "Does spatialized audio enhance the creation of mental representations?",
    "content": "Navigating unfamiliar environments without vision is a considerable challenge for blind individuals, as it requires constructing accurate cognitive maps. Binaural audio feedback, which delivers spatialized auditory cues, has been proposed as a means of enhancing spatial navigation by leveraging the auditory system's natural ability to localize sounds in three dimensions. This study investigated whether binaural audio feedback offers measurable advantages over non-spatialized feedback in supporting spatial perception and mental representation. Fourteen participants, seven blind individuals and seven blindfolded sighted individuals, explored controlled environments under both feedback conditions and reconstructed the layouts using LEGO models. Performance was evaluated through spatial correlation analysis and distance accuracy measures. Results revealed no significant differences between binaural and non-spatialized conditions for either group. These findings indicate that spatialization of descriptive audio alone may not be sufficient to enhance spatial representations, suggesting that factors such as prior training, task design, and integration with other sensory cues may be critical for unlocking the full potential of binaural audio in assistive navigation.",

    "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "title": "Statistical characterization of cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics evoked by cortical stimulation in mice",
    "content": "Objective. Statistical models are powerful tools for describing biological phenomena such as neuronal spiking activity. Although these models have been widely used to study spontaneous and stimulated neuronal activity, they have not yet been applied to analyze responses to electrical cortical stimulation. In this study, we present an innovative approach to characterize neuronal responses to electrical stimulation in the mouse cortex, providing detailed insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics. Approach. Our method applies mixture models to analyze the Peri-Stimulus time histogram of each neuron, predicting the probability of spiking at specific latencies following the onset of electrical stimuli. By applying this approach, we investigated neuronal responses to cortical stimulation recorded from the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and sensorimotor-related thalamic nuclei in the mouse brain. Main results. The characterization approach achieved high goodness of fit, and the model features were leveraged by applying machine learning methods for stimulus intensity decoding and classification of brain regions to which a neuron belongs given its response to the stimulus. The random forest model demonstrated the highest F1 scores, achieving 92.86% for stimulus intensity decoding and 84.35% for brain zone classification. Significance. This study presents a novel statistical framework for characterizing neuronal responses to electrical cortical stimulation, providing quantitative insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics. Our approach achieves high accuracy in stimulus decoding and brain region classification, providing valuable contributions for neuroscience research and neuro-technology applications.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "The heart continuously shapes neural processing and behavior through cardiac-brain interactions. While cortical excitability fluctuations and their role in cardiac-dependent cognitive and sensorimotor phenomena have been extensively studied, the temporal dynamics and contribution of spinal excitability oscillations across the cardiac cycle remain poorly characterized. In this study, we examine whether motor evoked potentials elicited by magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord are modulated by the cardiac cycle phase in healthy participants. Real-time adapting ECG-triggered stimulation enabled precise targeting of five phases across the cardiac cycle. Spinal excitability was significantly phase-dependent, with MEPs peaking during late diastole. MEPs amplitude was also found to be modulated by preceding cardiac intervals, where shorter intervals predict stronger diastolic facilitation. These findings establish that spinal excitability is rhythmically modulated by the cardiac cycle, potentially through blood pressure-mediated mechanisms. Notably, the diastolic facilitation observed here contrasts with previously reported motor cortex excitability profiles, indicating a non-synchronous cardiac modulation of spinal versus cortical excitability. These results may benefit neuromodulation approaches for motor and psychiatric disorder treatment and emphasize the critical importance of including spinal measures in future heart-brain interaction studies.",

Here we present a comprehensive spatially-resolved proteome atlas of the human brain, analyzing over two thousand MRI-guided locations across four individuals. Proteome analysis integrated with transcriptomics reveals extensive post-transcriptional regulation, with cortical regions showing markedly higher protein diversity than transcript. Unsupervised molecular clustering defines distinct brain territories that transcend anatomical boundaries, instead reflecting metabolic demands and functional specialization patterns. Application to epilepsy brain tissue uncovered disrupted astrocyte metabolism, protein homeostasis and therapeutic targets including the seizure-associated purinergic receptor P2RX7.

    "content": "<p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Human speech perception is multisensory, integrating auditory information from the talker's voice with visual information from the talker's face. BOLD fMRI studies have implicated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in processing auditory speech and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in integrating auditory and visual speech, but as an indirect hemodynamic measure, fMRI is limited in its ability to track the rapid neural computations underlying speech perception. Using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, we directly recorded from the STG and STS in 42 epilepsy patients (25F, 17M). Participants identified single words presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats with and without added auditory noise. Seeing the talker's face provided a strong perceptual benefit, improving perception of noisy speech in every participant. Neurally, a subpopulation of electrodes concentrated in mid-posterior STG and STS responded to both auditory speech (latency 71&nbsp;ms) and visual speech (109&nbsp;ms). Significant multisensory enhancement was observed, especially in the upper bank of the STS: compared with auditory-only speech, the response latency for audiovisual speech was 40% faster and the response amplitude was 18% larger. In contrast, STG showed neither faster nor larger multisensory responses. Surprisingly, STS response latencies for audiovisual speech were significantly faster than those in the STG (50&nbsp;ms vs 64&nbsp;ms), suggesting a parallel pathway model in which the STG plays the primary role in auditory-only speech perception, while the STS takes the lead in audiovisual speech perception. Together with fMRI, sEEG provides converging evidence that STS plays a key role in multisensory integration.</p>",

    "title": "Competition between Tool and Hand Motion Impairs Movement Planning in Limb Apraxia",
    "content": "<p>Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared with congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared with congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.</p>",

    "title": "Largely Intact But Less Reliable and Distributed Neural Representations of Subjective Value in Human Opioid Addiction",
    "content": "<p>Addiction, particularly opioid use disorder (OUD), is often characterized by heightened propensity for risk-taking. While tolerance for risk and uncertainty varies across individuals, the elevated risk-taking in people with OUD is assumed to stem from altered cognitive decision-making processes beyond differences due to idiosyncratic yet lawful tolerances. Specifically, the prevailing assumption is that people with addiction exhibit impairments in the internal representation and integration of information that should guide decisions and judgments about what is valuable. Using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the choice behavior of treatment-engaged male and female participants with chronic OUD aligns with the neural encoding of their inferred subjective value (SV) of uncertain (risky and ambiguous) rewards and the evidence for impairment in this neural process. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that canonical value regions [ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex] track the SV of uncertain choice options in both participants with OUD and comparison controls, irrespective of their tolerance for uncertainty. This speaks against a fundamentally impaired subjective valuation process in OUD. However, value representations were less reliably decodable in people with OUD in some value regions (vmPFC) and throughout the brain, especially within the limbic and salience/ventral-attention networks. Thus, while people with OUD engage a neurocomputationally similar process during risky decision-making to controls, they may differ in the fidelity and distribution of SV signals across brain networks.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Zinc is crucial for neuron function, but whether and how labile zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) acts as an intracellular signaling molecule remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using fluorescence imaging. Our findings reveal that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through various pathways induces intracellular acidification, which subsequently elicits Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes that reflect transient increases in cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been recorded in both rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) primary neuron cultures and organotypic mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) hippocampal slice cultures prepared from both males and females. They are specific to neurons and astrocytes but are absent in other cell types we tested including HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and fibroblasts. We further identify Metallothionein III (MT3), a Zn<sup>2+</sup> buffering protein specifically expressed in brain cells, as the source of these Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Reduction in MT3 expression by knockdown with shRNAmiR techniques significantly decreases the amplitude of Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, while overexpression of MT3 in HeLa and COS-7 cells is sufficient to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, demonstrating the crucial roles of MT3 in Zn<sup>2+</sup> release. Lastly, we explore the biological roles of MT3-mediated Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurons. Suppressing Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes with either MT3 knockdown or mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation results in increased dendritic branching in primary rat hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> release from endogenous MT3 acts as a regulatory signal to inhibit dendrite branching and growth, establishing a critical role for Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurite outgrowth and neuronal development.</p>",

Both anatomical and functional evidence have implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including area 32, in these processes, but the dynamics of neural responses in area 32 during naturalistic vocal interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this by recording the activity of single area 32 neurons using chronically implanted ultrahigh-density Neuropixels probes in freely moving male common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) engaged in an antiphonal calling paradigm in which they exchanged long-distance \"phee\" calls with a virtual conspecific. We found that many neurons exhibited complex modulations in discharge rates in response to presented calls, prior to and following self-generated calls, and during the interval between presented and produced vocalizations. These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of area 32 as an audiovocal interface integrating auditory information, cognitive processes, and motor outputs in the service of vocal communication.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via CB<sub>1</sub> cannabinoid receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs), which control pyramidal neuron differentiation, migration, and axonal guidance. Here, we investigated the long-lasting consequences of transient prenatal CB<sub>1</sub>R downregulation within the mouse prefrontal cortex by assessing its impact on gene expression, neuronal electrophysiological properties, and animal behavioral traits. Transient loss of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs as induced by in-utero small-interference RNA electroporation at Embryonic Day 14.5, when upper-layer neurons are generated, arrested cell migration leading to ectopic neurons that populated deep layers. Whole-cell current&ndash;clamp recordings showed that ectopic neurons are less excitable (increased afterhyperpolarization amplitude, decreased sag, lower firing frequency) than deep-layer&ndash;native pyramidal neurons. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), identified by microarray characterization of FACS-sorted electroporated neurons, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cortical development, regulation of cell migration, neurotransmitter secretion, and cytoskeletal organization. Gene set enrichment analysis also supported enrichment in pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders and synaptic function. The gene expression profile of siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived neurons showed DEGs that had been previously associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and autism. Venn diagrams unveiled one common DEG for neuropsychiatric risk databases and CB<sub>1</sub>R expression manipulation, namely, the transcription factor ZBTB20. Prenatal knockdown of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs induced long-lasting behavioral alterations in the adult offspring of either sex, with an impairment of social interaction and motor behavior in siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived adult mice. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in controlling the development of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and support the contribution of altered endocannabinoid signaling to neuropsychiatric vulnerability.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) neurons project to both cortex and thalamus, inducing multiple effects including the modulation of cortical and thalamic firing, and the emergence of high gamma oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP). We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations driven by L6CT neuron activation reflect the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice (both male and female) expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway in awake, head-fixed mice, we presented ramp-and-hold light at different intensities while recording neural activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) and the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) of the thalamus using silicon probes. We found that the activation of S1 L6CT neurons induces high-frequency LFP oscillations in S1 that are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across light intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the temporal evolution of firing rate in S1 and VPm. While most S1 neurons were steadily suppressed, VPm and S1 layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to facilitated within 500&nbsp;ms, suggesting differential recruitment of the intracortical versus cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we found that LFP frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons sculpt the frequency of S1 LFP oscillations through cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits, linking the recurrent interactions mediated by L6CT neurons to the high gamma oscillations observed across physiological and pathological conditions.</p>",

    "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
    "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

    "title": "Approaches for retraining sEMG classifiers for upper-limb prostheses",
    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

    "title": "Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation does not alter GABA concentration or functional connectivity in the normal visual cortex",
    "content": "IntroductionAnodal direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) of the visual cortex is a potential rehabilitation tool for vision disorders such as amblyopia and macular degeneration. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are currently unknown. When applied to the human motor cortex, a-tDCS reduces the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter that modulates neuroplasticity. Our primary aim was to assess whether the same a-tDCS paradigm alters local GABA concentration when applied to the healthy primary visual cortex. We also measured the effect of a-tDCS on visual cortex resting-state connectivity and sought to replicate reported observations of an association between visual cortex GABA concentration and the dynamics of binocular rivalry.MethodsFourteen participants with normal vision completed two brain imaging sessions at least 48 hours apart. In each session, binocular rivalry dynamics, primary visual cortex GABA and glutamate-glutamine (Glx) concentrations (via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) and resting-state functional connectivity (via task-free fMRI) were measured at baseline. Real or sham a-tDCS (20 min, 2mA) was then applied to the visual cortex in a randomized sequence followed by a second set of MRS and fMRI measurements.ResultsNo between-session effects of a-tDCS on GABA or Glx concentration or resting-state functional connectivity were observed. A pre-planned within-session analysis revealed a significant increase in Glx following a-tDCS that did not withstand multiple comparisons correction. No consistent relationships between binocular rivalry dynamics and GABA concentration were apparent.DiscussionTogether, our results suggest that a-tDCS effects on the visual cortex may differ from the GABA-associated mechanism in motor cortex.",

    "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory and cognitive function in elderly individuals. Early detection is vital to slow disease progression and enable timely therapeutic intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches for AD, however, often involve high time complexity and significant computational resource utilization, highlighting the need for more efficient automated solutions.MethodsThis study introduces a Resource Efficient Convolutional Neural Network (RECNN) framework for AD detection and diagnosis using brain MRI images. The methodology incorporates three main modules: Gabor transformation, data augmentation, and classification with an anomalous pixel segmentation algorithm. Gabor transforms are employed to enhance spatial frequency features and improve detection rates. Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of training samples. The RECNN classifier is then used for image classification, and functional morphological segmentation is applied to classify affected pixels into mild or advanced stages of AD. Two benchmark datasets are utilized for training and testing the proposed framework.ResultsThe proposed RECNN-based system demonstrated superior detection and classification performance compared with conventional AD detection methods. The model achieved improved accuracy and robustness, with segmentation results enabling the differentiation between mild and advanced AD cases. Comparative evaluation confirmed that RECNN significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high diagnostic reliability.DiscussionThe findings suggest that the RECNN framework offers a resource-efficient and accurate approach for AD detection using MRI data. By combining Gabor-based feature transformation, augmented data diversity, and advanced segmentation, the proposed method provides a scalable and clinically applicable tool for early diagnosis. Future work will extend the model to larger and more diverse datasets and explore hybrid architectures to further enhance diagnostic performance.",

Our approach recasts SNN computation into a unified \u201c8-bit \u00d7 2-bit\u201d paradigm by quantizing first-layer weights to 2 bits and subsequent layers to 8 bits. This standardization directly enables the design of a unified PE architecture, eliminating the resource redundancy inherent in decoupled designs. To mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by aggressive first-layer quantization, we first propose a channel-wise dual compensation strategy. This method synergizes channel-wise quantization optimization with adaptive threshold neurons, leveraging reparameterization techniques to restore model accuracy without incurring additional inference overhead. Building upon T8HWQ, we propose a novel unified computing architecture that overcomes the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs by efficiently multiplexing processing arrays. Experimental results support our approach: On CIFAR-100, our method achieves near-lossless accuracy (<0.7% degradation vs. full precision) with a single time step, matching state-of-the-art low-bit SNNs. At the hardware level, implementation results on the Xilinx Virtex 7 platform demonstrate that our unified computing unit conserves 20.2% of lookup table (LUT) resources compared to traditional decoupled architectures. This work delivers a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202fthroughput improvement over state-of-the-art SNN accelerators\u2014with comparable resource utilization and lower power consumption. Our integrated solution thus advances the practical implementation of high-performance, low-latency SNNs on resource-constrained edge devices.",

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "The effect of development on cortical auditory evoked potentials in normal hearing listeners and cochlear implant users",
    "content": "IntroductionCortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs), such as the P1-N1-P2 complex (onset response) and the acoustic change complex (ACC), provide insight into sound detection and discrimination. While their developmental trajectories are well documented in normal-hearing (NH) listeners, less is known about how these responses develop in pediatric cochlear implant (CI) users and how they are affected by background noise.MethodsCAEPs were recorded in quiet and +10 dB SNR noise conditions using long-duration vowel stimuli from 91 children and 11 adults with NH and 59 CI users (48 pre-lingually deafened children/young adults and 11 post-lingually deafened adults). Peak latencies (P1, N1, P2) and N1-P2 amplitudes were measured. Developmental effects were analyzed using linear regression, t-tests, and correlation analyses comparing child and adult waveforms.ResultsBoth onset and ACC responses were present across groups, with P1 latency decreasing significantly with age in NH and CI listeners. The ACC followed a similar developmental trajectory as the onset response but matured later, emerging reliably in adolescence. Noise delayed maturation, lengthened latencies, and reduced amplitudes, particularly for the ACC. CI users implanted before 3.5 years showed developmental patterns comparable to NH peers, though both onset and ACC responses were more affected by noise in CI users.Discussion/ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that early implantation supports the typical development of cortical auditory responses, underscoring the importance of neuroplasticity in pediatric CI users. However, the pronounced vulnerability of the ACC to noise highlights ongoing challenges in sound discrimination for CI users. CAEPs, especially ACC measures, may serve as objective markers of auditory maturation and could complement behavioral assessments in clinical practice.",

    "title": "Prognostic value of quantitative and visual electroencephalography in disorders of consciousness: a retrospective study",
    "content": "BackgroundElectroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to assess prognosis in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). Visual assessments by physicians and quantitative EEG (qEEG) are commonly used; however, only a few studies have directly compared their predictive accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the prognostic value of visual EEG classification versus that of qEEG-based spectral analysis for survival and neurological outcomes in patients with impaired consciousness.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we examined 97 patients with impaired consciousness admitted to the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Fukushima Medical University Hospital between April 2018 and December 2023. Visual EEG grading was performed using a conventional grading system based on established criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare predictive performance. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed incorporating qEEG and clinical prognostic factors (Scarpino score, rehabilitation status, and age). The incremental predictive value of clinical variables was assessed using DeLong\u2019s test.ResultsVisual EEG assessment showed moderate predictive accuracy [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.77 for survival; 0.677\u20130.725 for neurological outcomes]. qEEG-based models showed comparable performance to visual EEG classification, with slightly higher AUC values that were not statistically significant. The addition of clinical factors significantly improved predictive accuracy, particularly for neurological recovery (AUC improved from 0.729 to 0.936; P < 0.001).ConclusionCombining qEEG features and clinical prognostic factors provided a comprehensive approach for outcome prediction in patients with DoC. These findings support the potential of a multimodal prognostic framework integrating objective EEG metrics and physician-derived evaluations, although further prospective validation is required.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN! I'm Nick from Inkeep. We built an agent builder with true 2-way sync between code and a drag-and-drop visual editor, so devs and non-devs can collaborate on the same agents. Here\u2019s a demo video: <a href=\"https://go.inkeep.com/video\">https://go.inkeep.com/video</a>.<p>As a developer, the flow is:\n- Build AI Chat Assistants or AI Workflows with the TypeScript SDK\n- Run `inkeep push` from your CLI to publish your agent\n- Edit agents in the visual builder (or hand off to non-technical teams)\n- Run `inkeep pull` whenever you want to edit in code again.<p>We built this because we wanted the accessibility of no-code workflow builders (n8n, Zapier), but the flexibility and devex of code-based agent frameworks (LangGraph, Mastra). We also wanted first-class support for chat assistants with interactive UIs, not just workflows. OpenAI got close, but you can only do a one-time export from visual builder to code and there\u2019s vendor lock-in.<p>How we use it: I bootstrapped a few agents for our marketing and sales teams, then was able to hand off so they can maintain and create their own agents. This has enabled us to adopt agents across technical and non-technical roles in our company on a single platform.<p>To try it, here\u2019s the quickstart: <a href=\"https://go.inkeep.com/quickstart\">https://go.inkeep.com/quickstart</a>.<p>We leaned on open protocols to make it easy to use agents anywhere:\nAn MCP endpoint, so agents can be used from Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT\nA Chat UI library with interactive elements you can customize in React\nAn API endpoint compatible with the Vercel AI SDK `useChat` hook\nSupport for Agent2Agent (A2A) so they work with other agent ecosystems<p>We made some practical templates like a customer_support, deep_research, and docs_assistant. Deployment is easy with Vercel/Docker with a fair-code license. There\u2019s a traces UI and OTEL logs for observability.<p>Under the hood, we went all-in on a multi-agent architecture. Agents are made up of LLMs, MCPs, and agent-to-agent relationships. We\u2019ve found this approach to be easier to maintain and more flexible than traditional \u201cif/else\u201d approaches for complex workflows.<p>The interoperability works because the SDK and visual builder share a common underlying representation, and the Inkeep CLI bridges it with a mix of LLMs and TypeScript syntactic sugar. Details in our docs: <a href=\"https://docs.inkeep.com\">https://docs.inkeep.com</a>.<p>We\u2019re open to ideas and contributions, and would love to hear about your experience building agents - what works, hasn\u2019t worked, what\u2019s promising?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45604700\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45604700</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

    "content": "Acceptance can improve psychological functioning. However, research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy of acceptance, which may be related to instructions to accept different aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., thoughts vs. emotion). We compared the effects of self-regulation instructions to accept thoughts, emotions, or a combination of both on measures of affect (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, state anxiety) and emotional dysregulation immediately following emotion-eliciting film clips and following recovery periods after film clips. We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip. Implications of findings and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "title": "Early heart disease prediction using LV-PSO and Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolution Neural Network on phonocardiogram signals",
    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences.

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "content": "ObjectiveEarly speech experiences are presumed to contribute to the development of brain structures involved in processing speech. Previous research has been limited to correlational studies. Here, we conducted a randomized trial with neonates born preterm to determine whether increased exposure to maternal speech during NICU hospitalization is causally linked to structural white matter maturation.Study designWe enrolled 46 neonates born preterm (24\u201331 weeks gestational age). Participants were randomly assigned to receive increased (T: n = 21) or routine (C: n = 25) exposure to mother\u2019s speech. The T-group heard 10-min audio recordings of their mothers reading a children\u2019s story two times/hour between 10pm and 6am, increasing speech exposure by 2.67 h/day. The C-group did not hear recorded speech. At near-term-equivalent age, we obtained two high-angular resolution diffusion MRI (scan 1: b = 700, scan 2: b = 1500) and T1 relaxometry scans. We assessed mean diffusivity (MD), pre-registered primary outcome (NCT02847689), of the left and right arcuate fasciculus, tracts implicated in language processing. Secondary outcomes included fractional anisotropy (FA) and R1 (1/T1). We hypothesized that neonates randomized to the T-group would show evidence for increased maturation within the arcuate, indexed as decreased MD and increased FA and R1, compared to neonates in the C-group.ResultsGroups were equivalent on medical and demographic variables. Linear mixed models demonstrated that compared to the C-group, the T-group demonstrated significantly lower MD in the left (scan 1: \u03b2 = \u22120.11, Marginal R2 = 0.27; scan 2: \u03b2 = \u22120.12, Marginal R2 = 0.33) but not right arcuate (scan 1: \u03b2 = \u22120.06, Marginal R2 = 0.09; scan 2: \u03b2 = \u22120.03, Marginal R2 = 0.01). The T-group also demonstrated significantly higher FA (scan 1 \u03b2 = 0.02, Marginal R2 = 0.20; scan 2: \u03b2 = 0.03, Marginal R2 = 0.31) and R1 (\u03b2 = 0.02, Marginal R2 = 0.39) in the left but not right arcuate.ConclusionPreterm neonates with increased maternal speech exposure showed more mature left arcuate microstructure, supporting a causal role of exposure to speech in brain development. Enhancing speech exposure in the NICU may benefit preterm children\u2019s language outcomes.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

Analysis tools for peripheral nerve recordings remain underdeveloped compared to those for brain signals, limiting the advancement of nerve neurotechnologies for clinical treatments such as closed-loop systems. This study introduces and explores the performance of two novel nerve signal analysis techniques\u2014cross-correlation analysis and spike delay velocity analysis\u2014which rely on a defining feature of peripheral nerve signals: the reliable conduction velocity of signals transmitted by axons in nerves. Approach. We test the capabilities of the introduced cross-correlation and spike delay velocity analysis techniques both in silico on synthetic nerve signals and on in vivo nerve signals acquired from freely-moving rats. Main results. Our findings show that both techniques can be successfully employed to extract transmission direction and velocity information from compact two-electrode site peripheral nerve recording designs. Notably, cross-correlation analysis can be employed to detect neural signals of very low signal-to-noise ratio, otherwise undetectable by typical spike detection approaches. Significance. Our findings provide new techniques to both enhance detection and extract new information in the form of velocity data from nerve recordings using a compact two-electrode site recording setup. Unlike traditional methods, this design eliminates the need for long electrode arrays, making it particularly well-suited for use in freely-moving animal models and translational applications. As axon signal conduction direction and velocity are tightly linked to neural function, these techniques can support new research into peripheral nervous system function and new therapeutic approaches driven by neural interfaces.",

    "content": "Objective. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for decoding electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) signals. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity and variability of available training data. Existing data augmentation methods often introduce signal distortions or lack physiological validity. This study proposes a novel augmentation strategy designed to improve generalization while preserving the underlying neurophysiological structure of EEG signals. Approach. We propose Background EEG Transform (BGTransform), a principled data augmentation framework that leverages the neurophysiological dissociation between task-related activity and ongoing background EEG. In contrast to existing methods, BGTransform generates new trials by selectively perturbing the background EEG component while preserving the task-related signal, thus enabling controlled variability without compromising class-discriminative features. We applied BGTransform to three publicly available EEG-BCI datasets spanning steady-state visual evoked potential and P300 paradigms. The effectiveness of BGTransform is evaluated using several widely adopted neural decoding models under three training regimes: (1) without augmentation (baseline model), (2) with conventional augmentation methods, and (3) with BGTransform. Main results. Across all datasets and model architectures, BGTransform consistently outperformed both baseline models and conventional augmentation techniques. Compared to models trained without BGTransform, it achieved average classification accuracy improvements of 2.45%\u201315.52%, 4.36%\u201317.15% and 7.55%\u201310.47% across the three datasets, respectively. In addition, BGTransform demonstrated greater robustness across subjects and tasks, maintaining stable performance under varying recording conditions. Significance. BGTransform provides a principled and effective approach to augmenting EEG data, informed by neurophysiological insight. By preserving task-related components and introducing controlled variability, the method addresses the challenge of data sparsity in EEG-BCI training. These findings support the utility of BGTransform for improving the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of deep learning models in neural engineering applications.",

Despite the comparable ability to extract more abstract cognitive signals from the brain, little effort has been devoted to leveraging these signals in neuro-engineering applications. In this study, we explore the use of neural signals related to economic value, a key cognitive construct, in a BMI context. Approach. Using multivariate time series data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices in a value-based decision-making task. We implement a reinforcement learning-based training approach to develop adaptive decoders that can be extended to handle multi-step decisions, which frequently arise in real-world settings. Main results. We develop neural decoders leveraging subjective value signals to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices with accuracy on average, with above-chance accuracy even when choice options are objectively equal. We show that this same decoder architecture can be trained to execute choice-related actions and execute action sequences aligned with the user\u2019s goal. Finally, we explore a decoder architecture that uses a neural forecasting model equipped with task-related information, and show that it makes high accuracy predictions \u2009ms sooner than would otherwise be possible. Significance. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuro-engineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals to aid users in goal-directed behavior. They suggest that using abstract cognitive signals in real-world settings may be more accurate when combined with information from multiple sources, such as motor and sensory regions. This research also highlights the potential need for systems to measure their confidence in their actions when user input is minimal.",

    "content": "Objective. New implantable and wearable devices hold great promise to help patients manage their seizure disorders. One proposed application is measuring the rate of interictal epileptiform discharges as a biomarker of medication levels and seizure risk. This study aims to determine whether interictal epileptiform spike rates (spikes) are independently associated with anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels and evaluate whether spike rates are a reliable biomarker for ASM levels. Approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 69 patients with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring during ASM taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit. An automated spike detection algorithm, validated seizure annotations, and a model of ASM load were used to assess the relationship between spike rates, ASM level, state of consciousness, and seizure timing using linear mixed effects models. Event related analysis and seasonal autoregressive models were applied to evaluate both short-term and longer-term effects of ASMs on spike rates, respectively. Main Results. Spike rates were found to increase following seizures, during sleep, and in patients experiencing early seizures, with no significant association between ASM load and spike rates after controlling for these confounders. Initial models without controls showed a positive association between ASM load and spike rates. However, this relationship disappeared when the effects of sleep and seizures were accounted for. Medication-specific analysis revealed that only levetiracetam showed a significant impact on spike rates during taper. Significance. This study demonstrates that interictal spike rates are more strongly influenced by seizure activity and sleep than by ASM levels, suggesting limited utility of spike rates as a biomarker for ASM load. However, spikes may still serve as important markers for seizure control and disease severity.",

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
    "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

    "content": "Affective blindsight, the capacity to discriminate emotional stimuli despite bilateral damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) and without conscious awareness, offers a unique model of non-conscious visual processing. Subcortical pathways involving the pulvinar and amygdala have been proposed, but putative cortical contributions remain unclear. We examined 182 patients, including 31 with bilateral V1 lesions. Among these, 15 had cortical visual loss and 7 showed affective blindsight. Using behavioral testing, lesion symptom mapping, and tractography, we found that preserved pulvinar connectivity with both the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the amygdala is necessary for affective blindsight. These findings provide causal evidence for a multi-route architecture, identifying the pulvinar-STS pathway, alongside the pulvinar-amygdala pathway, as a critical substrate for non-conscious affective processing.",

    "content": "IntroductionPerinatal brain injury is a leading cause of cerebral palsy. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) provides a non-invasive method for investigating motor pathway development; however, data on the safety and feasibility of its repeated use in infants are limited. This study provides the first longitudinal evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of spTMS in infants with perinatal brain injury.MethodsTwenty infants with perinatal brain injury (corrected age 3\u201325 months) participated in 46 spTMS sessions while awake. Safety and tolerability were systematically assessed using heart rate, respiratory rate, and the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS). Feasibility was quantified by session completion, participant retention, and acquisition of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from bilateral wrist flexors.ResultsAcross 2,527 pulses, no adverse events occurred. Physiological measures and MBPS scores remained stable from pre- to post-stimulation. Analyzable electromyography (EMG) was obtained in 100% of sessions, with MEPs successfully elicited in 44/46 sessions (95.7%) across 19/20 infants (95%). A high longitudinal retention rate (85%) further demonstrated excellent protocol acceptability.DiscussionThese findings establish a safe, reproducible framework for longitudinal spTMS in a vulnerable infant population. This methodological advance enables future investigations into neuroplasticity and corticospinal tract development after early brain injury, with the potential to yield biomarkers that guide the timing and targets of early interventions.",

    "content": "Loudness dependence of auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP), a neurophysiological measure that reflects central serotonergic activity, is also influenced by the noradrenaline and dopamine systems. While it has been used in investigations of various psychiatric disorders, the fundamental characteristics in healthy individuals remain largely unknown. The present exploratory study examined 60 healthy adults to determine the associations of LDAEP with psychological traits assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The participants completed TCI and STAI questionnaires before undergoing electrophysiological recordings. LDAEP was measured based on the peak-to-peak amplitude slopes of P50/N100 and N100/P200 across five sound intensity levels. Using Spearman's correlation analysis, moderate negative correlations of LDAEP slopes with harm avoidance (HA) and trait anxiety (STAI-T) scores were noted. Additionally, sex-adjusted analysis showed novelty seeking to be positively associated with LDAEP. These findings suggest an association of LDAEP with individual differences in harm avoidance, trait anxiety, and novelty seeking in healthy adults. This supports the potential use of LDAEP as a non-invasive biomarker to predict treatment response in major depressive disorder, as well as in anxiety-related conditions.",

    "content": "BackgroundSomatic, cognitive and mental health issues have been identified in three-quarters of people 5\u202fmonths after hospitalisation for severe acute SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. The underlying neuroanatomical basis of these symptoms remains unclear, but recent studies suggest a role for altered brainstem physiology. We aimed to test the hypothesis that brainstem neurochemical profiles differ in patients who had been hospitalised for COVID-19 compared to matched controls using 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).MethodsThis prospective case\u2013control study recruited 34 individuals who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and 15 healthy controls with no history of COVID-19 infection from two major UK hospitals before vaccines became available. The participants underwent 7T semi-adiabatic localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (sLASER) 1H-MRS at the ponto-medullary junction. Water-referenced metabolite concentrations were compared between the patients and controls and correlated with infection severity, as measured by maximum C-reactive protein (CRPmax) assay during inpatient admission. Linear mixed modelling was used with a 0.05 significance level.ResultsSpectral quality was high/acceptable in 44/49 participants according to the MRS Consensus criteria. The magnitude of inflammation during patient admission (i.e., CRPmax) correlated positively with myo-inositol concentration (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.005, p\u202f=\u202f0.035), as did patient-reported symptoms (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.564, p\u202f=\u202f0.023). However, metabolite concentrations were not significantly different between the patients and controls.ConclusionWe show the feasibility of assessing brainstem neurochemical profiles using 7T 1H-MRS in a multi-centre study. Technical limitations at one site\u2019s 7T MRI led to variable repetition times, which limited our statistical power and should be avoided in future studies. Our findings highlight the need for further investigation into the role of neuroinflammation in post-acute COVID-19.",

    "title": "Endovascular management of tandem embolic stroke due to cardioembolic free-floating thrombus: a case report",
    "content": "BackgroundTandem lesions (TLs), defined as simultaneous occlusions of both extracranial and intracranial arteries, represent a particularly challenging subset of large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes. While most TLs are attributed to atherosclerotic changes or arterial dissection, a smaller subset originates from cardioembolic emboli arising from the heart or aortic arch, commonly referred to as embolic tandem lesions. In rare instances, these emboli form a free-floating thrombus (FFT) in the carotid artery, characterized by mobile intraluminal thrombotic material with high embolic potential. Optimal treatment strategies for these rare and complex cases remain undefined.Case summaryWe present a rare case involving an embolic tandem lesion in a 73-year-old male with known atrial fibrillation who presented with acute ischemic stroke upon awakening. Imaging and angiography demonstrated a free-floating thrombus (FFT) at the brachiocephalic bifurcation extending into the origins of the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries, a free-floating thrombus at the carotid bifurcation, and an additional thrombus occluding the right ICA terminus and the origin of the M1 segment. A staged endovascular approach was employed: intracranial recanalization was first achieved via mechanical thrombectomy, followed by stent-assisted stabilization of the residual free-floating thrombus within the common carotid artery. The patient experienced significant neurological improvement and attained functional independence at 3-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic complexity associated with embolic tandem lesions and carotid FFT involvement. Comprehensive preprocedural imaging, including assessment of the aortic arch and cervical vessels, is critical. A personalized, multi-modality endovascular approach combining thrombectomy and stenting can enable successful revascularization and favorable clinical outcomes, particularly when FFT complicates tandem occlusions.",

    "title": "Neuralace: manufacture, parylene-C coating, and mechanical properties",
    "content": "Objective. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type subdural electrode array, to characterize its mechanical compatibility with neural tissue (i.e., the forces exerted onto the brain upon conformation) for chronic brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A full-factorial design of experiments was used to assess the effects of geometrical variations, orientation, and polymeric encapsulation on the stiffness of silicon-based Neuralace structures. A custom low-force four-point bending setup was developed to measure flexural stiffness in a physiologically relevant displacement range. Main results. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N m\u22121 to 7.21 N m\u22121, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, orientation, and parylene-C (PPXC) encapsulation. Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10\u2013100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the brain\u2019s topology (considering a 60 mm radius of the gyrus). Significance. Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. These arrays are now transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs, which requires consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study establishes a rigorous and reproducible framework for mechanical characterization of conformable neural implants and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning design parameters to reduce implant-induced mechanical stress on cortical tissue. The results support future development of chronic BCI-compatible subdural electrodes with improved biocompatibility through mechanical design.",

    "title": "Examining the associations between nonbelieved memories and memory distrust, self-esteem, and rumination.",
    "content": "When beliefs in autobiographical memories are reduced while recollections remain relatively intact, a phenomenon termed nonbelieved memories (NBMs) unfolds. The current preregistered study (<em>N</em> = 104) used a 3-week longitudinal design to investigate the relationships between the frequency of recalled NBMs, memory distrust, rumination over autobiographical events, and self-esteem. Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Dissociation is a phenomenon present in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders as well as in the general population. The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "title": "Mental pain, boredom, and diffuse nociception.",
    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: Developmental dyslexia (DD) has been related to deficits in multiple cognitive skills. Phonological processing deficits are the most frequently reported in opaque orthographies, but there are few studies of transparent orthographies, such as Spanish. The aim of this study was to comprehensively explore possible deficiencies in cognitive functions in Spanish-speaking Mexican children with DD, to determine whether these deficits can explain problems with decoding fluency and accuracy, and analyze whether they provide support for some of the explanatory hypotheses of DD. Method: An extensive cognitive assessment was performed with Spanish-speaking readers: 40 children (20 girls) with DD (mean age 9.02 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.49) and 40 children (20 girls) who were typical readers (mean age 9.22 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.45). Results: Our results showed that most of the children with DD presented deficits in multiple cognitive skills, although not all of these skills contributed to reading performance. These cognitive deficits were not equally distributed among all children and there was no cognitive skill in which all participants with DD showed poor performance. Our results demonstrated that recognition of letter orientation, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming were significant predictors of reading ability. Conclusion: These findings support the idea that reading is a multifactorial process involving many cognitive skills, and its disruption could arise from different causes. The main findings are discussed in relation to the major explanatory hypotheses of DD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic condition with implications on cognitive functions such as decision-making and impulse control. Intertemporal choice paradigms, measuring temporal discounting, offer insight into decision-making of addictive behaviors. When coupled with mouse kinematics, they also provide implicit measures of decision dynamics. Here, we employed mouse kinematics to investigate the profile of both explicit and implicit intertemporal decision-making in CUD patients versus healthy controls, and the degree of association with clinical, psychiatric, and neuropsychological measures. Method: We recorded mouse kinematics during an intertemporal choice task in 36 CUD patients and 34 healthy matched controls. Before testing, CUD patients underwent a general assessment on a set of addiction-related psychiatric and cognitive domains. Results: In line with previous literature, results revealed higher discount rates in the CUD group. Mouse kinematics was able to discriminate among groups, with CUD patients displaying straighter trajectories for immediate choices and edge-curved ones for future ones. Further, a series of significant correlations have been found between discount rates, kinematic measures and both clinical and psychiatric indices. Conclusions: Overall, these results hold important implications and relevant insights for tailored therapeutic interventions, relapses prediction, and neurobiological classification of addictive disorders.

    "title": "Anhedonia is associated with impaired memory for positive emotional stimuli in individuals with schizophrenia.",
    "content": "Objective: Individuals with psychotic disorders routinely display anhedonia when rated on clinical interviews that rely on retrospective reports of pleasure; however, hedonic response is intact on laboratory paradigms measuring self-reported in-the-moment (i.e., consummatory) pleasure. It is currently unclear how to reconcile this apparent discrepancy. In the present study, we examined the possibility that clinician-rated anhedonia is associated with impaired memory for positive information across two experiments. Method: In Experiment 1, individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ; <em>n</em> = 28) and healthy controls (CN: <em>n</em> = 21) completed valence and arousal ratings of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral photograph stimuli, followed by an unprompted recognition test after a 1-week delay. In Experiment 2, individuals with SZ (<em>n</em> = 102) and CN (<em>n</em> = 60) completed the Emotional Verbal Learning Test, which assesses memory for word stimuli from happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety conditions over five immediate free-recall trials, short-delay free recall, 20-min long-delay free recall, and long-delay yes/no recognition conditions. Results: Results of Experiment 1 indicated that SZ and CN reported similar levels of valence and arousal to visual stimuli; however, SZ had poorer recognition memory for both pleasant and unpleasant stimuli compared with CN. In Experiment 2, CN demonstrated preferential recall for happiness over sadness, anger, and anxiety stimuli. However, this preferential recall advantage for happiness stimuli was less evident in SZ. Conclusions: Across both studies, reduced recall or recognition for positive stimuli was associated with greater severity of anhedonia. Collectively, findings from these two experiments suggest that clinical ratings of anhedonia are associated with memory deficits for positive stimuli in SZ.

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "ObjectivePost-stroke depression (PSD), a common neuropsychiatric complication, significantly hinders stroke recovery and quality of life. Given the established role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PSD, this study aimed to identify key inflammation-related genes and pathways using bioinformatics and machine learning and further evaluate the protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) monomer compounds.MethodsPSD-related datasets (GSE16561, GSE98793) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package, followed by functional enrichment analysis with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Three machine learning algorithms\u2014random forest, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)\u2014were applied to screen inflammation-related hub genes. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Candidate TCM compounds were explored via the Coremine Medical database. A PSD rat model was established to validate hub gene expression and to assess the efficacy of berberine (BBR).ResultsAnalysis identified 35 inflammation-related DEGs (IDEGs) significantly enriched in immunological processes, including malaria pathogenesis, NETosis, innate immune deficiencies, Rap1 signaling, and IL-17 cascades. The integration of machine learning pinpointed TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core hub genes, demonstrating robust diagnostic performance in external validation. Molecular docking suggested a strong binding affinity between the TCM compound BBR and TLR2/CYP1B1 proteins. PSD rats exhibited prolonged immobility in forced swim/tail suspension tests and decreased sucrose preference versus controls, alongside neuronal damage, edema, and inflammatory infiltration (HE staining). BBR treatment reversed these behavioral deficits and pathological changes. Western blot analysis confirmed elevated TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression in PSD rats, significantly downregulated by BBR. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed increased serum IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels in PSD, which BBR effectively reduced.ConclusionThis study identifies TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core inflammation-related genes in PSD. BBR demonstrates therapeutic efficacy as an active monomer compound against PSD, likely mediated through downregulating TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression, consequently diminishing the concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) that mediate cerebroprotective actions.",

    "content": "ObjectivesMutations in KIDINS220 are known to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and SINO syndrome. However, the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of KIDINS220-related disorders remains incompletely understood. Herein, we describe the clinical, electrophysiological, histopathological, and genetic features of a novel KIDINS220 sterile alpha motif (SAM) -like domain mutation identified in a Chinese family with HSP accompanied by severe peripheral neuropathy (PN).MethodsClinical data, electrophysiological characteristics, and sural nerve histopathology were analyzed in a 19-year-old Chinese male. Genetic testing was performed in his family by using whole-exome sequencing, mitochondrial genome testing, and Sanger validation. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to analyze the phenotypic and genetic data of previously reported cases with KIDINS220 variants up to July 2025.ResultsThe proband exhibited classical signs of autosomal dominant HSP accompanied by severe multifocal sensory-motor PN. The spinal cord MRI showed mild spinal cord thinning, while the brain MRI and nerve ultrasound examinations were normal. Electrophysiological study revealed absent sensory nerve responses and globally reduced motor conduction velocities. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed significantly reduced nerve fiber density, myelin defects, axonal degeneration, and mitochondrial abnormalities. A heterozygous KIDINS220 c.3668A > G (p. Glu1223Gly) mutation, located within the SAM domain, was identified in both the proband and his mother. A total of 42 cases from 11 cohorts were reviewed.ConclusionWe suggest that patients with KIDINS220 SAM domain mutation may present with HSP accompanied by severe, mixed axonal and demyelinating PN, expanding the existing spectrum of the clinical phenotypes and pathogenic variants of KIDINS220.",

    "title": "Glymphatic system and mild traumatic brain injury: a mini review",
    "content": "Since the discovery of the glymphatic system in 2012, research on this brain-wide fluid exchange pathway has focused on understanding its role in different neurological diseases. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a prevalent, yet often undiagnosed, condition that increases the risk of developing debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. mTBI may lead to impaired glymphatic system function and, therefore, accumulation of metabolic waste in the brain. In this review, we summarize 24 studies (10 rodent, 13 human, 1 both) published during 2013\u20132025, reporting post-mTBI changes in the glymphatic system. According to pre-clinical models, potential post-mTBI drivers of glymphatic dysfunction include depolarization of aquaporin 4 water channels and sleep deprivation. In studies on humans, evidence is contradictory; some studies show reduced post-mTBI glymphatic activity, while others report increased activity. However, these studies used different patient populations, which were likely exposed to different mTBI types and post-injury time frames. Furthermore, studies on humans used non-invasive imaging techniques, which only indirectly measure glymphatic activity. Taken together, these inconsistencies point to major gaps in the field, highlighting the need for standardized injury classification and post-injury time frames, and more direct measurements of glymphatic activity in humans. Notably, sleep deprivation, post-concussive symptoms, and cognitive impairment have often been linked to post-injury glymphatic dysfunction. Nevertheless, to better understand mTBI implications on glymphatic system functioning, further research is needed. Such research could help develop novel diagnostics or treatment strategies for mTBI and potentially mitigate the long-term risks of developing neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "content": "IntroductionBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) leverage EEG signal processing to enable human-machine communication and have broad application potential. However, existing deep learning-based BCI methods face two critical limitations that hinder their practical deployment: reliance on manual EEG feature extraction, which constrains their ability to adaptively capture complex neural patterns, and high energy consumption characteristics that make them unsuitable for resource-constrained portable BCI devices requiring edge deployment.MethodsTo address these limitations, this work combines wavelet transform for automatic feature extraction with spiking neural networks for energy-efficient computation. Specifically, we present a novel spiking transformer that integrates a spiking self-attention mechanism with discrete wavelet transform, termed SpikeWavformer. SpikeWavformer enables automatic EEG signal time-frequency decomposition, eliminates manual feature extraction, and provides energy-efficient classification decision-making, thereby enhancing the model's cross-scene generalization while meeting the constraints of portable BCI applications.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SpikeWavformer in emotion recognition and auditory attention decoding tasks.DiscussionThese findings indicate that SpikeWavformer can address the key limitations of existing BCI methods and holds promise for practical deployment in portable, resource-constrained scenarios.",

    "title": "The Algorithmic Regulator",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \\emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \\emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\\varnothing$, i.e., \\[ \\Delta = K\\big(O_{W,\\varnothing}\\big) - K\\big(O_{W,R}\\big) > 0. \\] We then prove that the larger $\\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\\Delta > 0$ yields \\[ \\Pr\\big((W,R)\\mid x\\big) \\le C\\,2^{\\,M(W{:}R)}\\,2^{-\\Delta}, \\] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \\emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \\emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \\emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.",

    "content": "Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) holds promise for the detection and characterisation of dementia. The Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) Study, by the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA), provides a unique resource to study deeply phenotyped neurodegenerative conditions. We present RSFC derivatives for 784 participants (data release 7 of the cohort) who were either cognitively unimpaired or diagnosed primarily with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mixed dementia (AD with a vascular component), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular MCI, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease with or without MCI or dementia, Lewy body disease or subjective cognitive impairment. Functional MRI scans were preprocessed using fMRIPrep, and time-series and whole-brain connectomes generated using three atlases at multiple resolutions, denoised using seven different techniques. High-motion artifacts were managed using a liberal quality control threshold appropriate for an older clinical population, resulting in data from 680 participants. These derivatives are made available to the research community to accelerate research on RSFC biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease, reducing duplication of effort, saving computational resources, and improving standardisation across studies.",

    "title": "Perceiving surface colour requires attention",
    "content": "Colour constancy refers to our ability to distinguish changes in surface properties from changes in the properties of light illuminating the scene. The apparent ease with which we can tell that objects do not change colour, for example, when moving from sunlight to the shade, belies the complexity of solving this ill-constrained problem. Although there is a substantial body of work testing which image cues might be used to accomplish this, there is surprisingly little known of how the brain performs this computation. Here, we tested a fundamental aspect of this perceptual process: whether it requires attention. We measured visual search times for both surface colour (requiring separation of surface and illuminant properties) and 'raw', colorimetric colour (which does not). We found a clear difference between the two: visual search for colorimetric colour was fast and near-parallel, while search for surface colour was slow and consistent with the serial deployment of attention. That is, search times suggest that the perceptual separation of surface and illuminant properties in colour constancy may require an attention-based process analogous to perceiving conjunctions of simple features in 'feature binding'. Colour discrimination thresholds suggested that while colorimetric colour detection is fast and parallel, once attention was directed to these stimuli and perceptual scission occurs, colorimetric colour information was discarded by the visual system. These results offer important new insights into the sequence of processes the brain uses to accomplish colour constancy.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.09951v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs. We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture. In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.",

This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets.

    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A while back I made <a href=\"https://github.com/m3rcurylake/Nyxelf/\">Nyxelf</a>, a static and dynamic analysis toolkit. Well, in a sentence, it got overhauled to a great extent. </p> <p>What it does : It provides a professional report of the executable, I replaced the simple strace dynamic analysis system with BPFtrace, Valgrind and tcpdump running on a minimal buildroot image, tracing dynamic and memory activity, along with capturing network packets, which is further enhanced with ai-assisted summerisation of the dynamic analysis. I used pyelftools, capstone etc for static analysis, which detects symbols, functions, sections, headers, .rodata variables etc. Finally it disassembles the binary to readable C and x64 intel Assembly with capstone, r2pipe and angr. And this entire thing is presented on the screen with pywebview with a cool one-dark theme.</p> <p>Target Audience: Direct audience are security enthusiasts, professionals, reverse engineers, anyone wanting a quick scan on a suspicious file. According to me it can be used by both offensive and defensive teams.</p> <p>Comparisons : It is not very hard to find comparisons or inspirations in this area. I was using ghidra on almost a regular basis, so I just wanted something similar but minimal with power of dynamic analysis and ai overview, though it comes nowhere near the power of ghidra. A direct comparison would be <a href=\"https://github.com/danielpoliakov/lisa\">LiSa</a> by danielpoliakov which uses SystemTap instead of eBPF for tracing. </p> <p>Critisisms are welcome. Suggestions are highly appreciated.

This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

    "title": "The articulatory basis of phonological error patterns in childhood speech sound disorders",
    "content": "Speech acquisition involves complex coordination of articulatory structures, primarily the jaw, lips, and tongue. Typically developing children acquire speech sounds in a hierarchical sequence governed by progressive neuromotor maturation. However, disruptions in speech motor control can lead to systematic phonological error patterns, commonly attributed to cognitive-linguistic deficits. This study explores the articulatory foundations of phonological error patterns in preschool-aged children diagnosed with moderate-to-severe speech sound disorders. Using data from 48 children who participated in a randomized controlled trial, we employed Mutual Information Analysis and Random Forest Models to quantify associations between specific speech motor limitations and phonological error patterns identified via the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology assessment. Results showed moderate associations between phonological error patterns in particular cluster reduction, final consonant deletion, stopping, gliding, and atypical errors and limitations in jaw, labial-facial, and lingual control. Gliding, unexpectedly, demonstrated a negative relationship with speech motor errors, being more prevalent among older and milder cases, suggesting it may reflect a compensatory developmental stage rather than purely phonological simplification. These findings highlight the significance of speech motor constraints in phonological error patterns, challenging traditional cognitive-linguistic explanations. The results support theoretical frameworks such as Articulatory Phonology, emphasizing that phonological error patterns are influenced substantially by articulatory and neuromotor development. This study underscores the need for integrating motor considerations into clinical assessments and interventions for speech sound disorders in children, fostering a comprehensive approach bridging cognitive-linguistic and motor speech perspectives.",

    "title": "Modeling dyslexia in neurotypical adults by combining neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques: a hypothesis paper",
    "content": "Dyslexia is a prevalent developmental disorder marked by deficits in literacy skills. Given that the core deficits of dyslexia are uniquely human, animal models have not been as useful in dyslexia research as they have been in other areas of research. While significant progress has been made through behavioral and neuroimaging studies, a viable model could facilitate controlled investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia and accelerate the development of targeted interventions. In this hypothesis article, we propose a two-pronged approach to model dyslexia in neurotypical adults using neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques. First, we propose using functional and structural MRI data to cluster individuals into neuropathologically derived subgroups in order to facilitate the classification of dyslexia subtypes based on neuropathological characteristics. Second, we propose employing transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) to temporarily downregulate activity in brain regions specified in the clustering analysis, inducing subtype-specific dyslexic symptoms in neurotypical individuals. This approach enables the establishment of causal or probabilistic relationships between neuropathologies and dyslexia subtypes, while at the same time creating dyslexia models to facilitate investigation into subtype-specific interventions. Although this model is somewhat limited by the transient nature of neuromodulation as well as by the use of healthy adults to model a developmental disorder whose symptoms first arise in childhood, it is a meaningful step towards refining our understanding of the neural basis of dyslexia subtypes and it opens the door to novel and effective therapies. By integrating neuroimaging and neuromodulation, we hope to offer a viable substitute for animal models in dyslexia and accelerate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for dyslexia.",

    "title": "Efficacy of snap-needle patch therapy in pediatric epilepsy: a case study",
    "content": "BackgroundsEpilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder in early childhood, often characterized by genetic predisposition and diverse clinical manifestations. Benign epilepsy of childhood with central temporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common form of self-limited focal epilepsy (SeLFE) syndrome in children, accounting for approximately 6%\u20137% of all childhood epilepsy cases (Wirrell et al., 2011; Camfield et al., 1996). We report a case of a child who was treated with additional snap-needle for 3 months on top of poorly controlled oral medication alone, who stopped having seizures and gradually reduced the dose of oral medication and finally stopped, and was followed up for 1 year after stopping the medication without any recurrence.Case summaryA 10-years-old male had his first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) at age 7 during nocturnal sleep. Following this event, the parents sought medical evaluation, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal wave patterns. Over the following 3 years, the child had 2\u20133 GTCS annually; despite multiple adjustments to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, GTCS frequency indicated disease progression. However, after starting snap-needle patch therapy [guided by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles], the child remained seizure-free. Continuous monitoring has been conducted to date. We present this case of a pediatric patient with epilepsy: oral medication failed to control GTCS, but snap-needle patch therapy achieved successful seizure management, after which oral medication was discontinued.ConclusionAfter a systematic literature search, this study represents the first case report of BECTS treated with snap-needle therapy (needle size: 0.220 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm). In this case, the child\u2019s GTCSs resolved following the addition of snap-needle therapy, and oral antiepileptic medication was gradually reduced to complete discontinuation; no seizure recurrence was observed within 1 year of follow-up. It is important to acknowledge that the contributions of medication adjustments and the self-limiting nature of BECTS cannot be ruled out in this case. However, based on the observations here, we propose the hypothesis that snap-needle intervention is likely associated with seizure remission. Although the mechanism underlying snap-needle therapy for BECTS remains unclear, the child achieved a QOLCE-16-C score of 98.4 at the end of treatment; during the 1-year follow-up, the number of nighttime sleep disruptions also decreased from 2 to 5 episodes per year to 0. These outcomes surpass those typically achievable through pharmacological intervention alone.",

    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

    "content": "Objective. Steady-state visually evoked potential-based Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or participants of previous experiments), to the new user (target domain) using only unlabeled target data. Approach. Our method adapts the pre-trained DNN to the new user by minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and local-regularity terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and forces the DNN to assign similar labels to adjacent instances. Main results. Our method achieves excellent ITRs of 201.15\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 and 145.02\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 on the benchmark and BETA datasets, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is available at https://github.com/osmanberke/SFDA-SSVEP-BCI. Significance. The proposed method prioritizes user comfort by removing the burden of calibration while maintaining an excellent character identification accuracy and ITR. Because of these attributes, our approach could significantly accelerate the adoption of BCI systems into everyday life.",

    "title": "Brain-to-text decoding with context-aware neural representations and large language models",
    "content": "Objective. Decoding attempted speech from neural activity offers a promising avenue for restoring communication abilities in individuals with speech impairments. Previous studies have focused on mapping neural activity to text using phonemes as the intermediate target. While successful, decoding neural activity directly to phonemes ignores the context dependent nature of the neural activity-to-phoneme mapping in the brain, leading to suboptimal decoding performance. Approach. In this work, we propose the use of diphone\u2014an acoustic representation that captures the transitions between two phonemes\u2014as the context-aware modeling target. We integrate diphones into existing phoneme decoding frameworks through a novel divide-and-conquer strategy in which we model the phoneme distribution by marginalizing over the diphone distribution. Our approach effectively leverages the enhanced context-aware representation of diphones while preserving the manageable class size of phonemes, a key factor in simplifying the subsequent phoneme-to-text conversion task. Main results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Brain-to-Text 2024 benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art phoneme error rate (PER) of 15.34% compared to 16.62% PER of monophone-based decoding. When coupled with finetuned large language models (LLMs), our method yields a Word error rate (WER) of 5.77%, significantly outperforming the 8.93% WER of the leading method in the benchmark. Significance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging context-aware neural representations and LLMs for brain-to-text decoding, thereby expanding the capabilities of speech neuroprostheses and paving the way toward restoring communication in individuals with speech impairments.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "title": "Effects of AC induced electric fields on neuronal firing sensitivity and activity patterns",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "title": "Disentangling indirect versus direct effects of somatosensory cortex microstimulation on neurons in primary motor and ventral premotor cortex",
    "content": "Objective. Intracortical microstimulation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1-ICMS) is being developed to provide on-line feedback for bidirectional brain\u2013machine interfaces. Because S1-ICMS can alter the discharge of the motor cortex neurons used to decode motor intent, successful application of S1-ICMS feedback requires understanding the modulation it produces in motor cortex neuron activity. Approach. We investigated the effects of S1-ICMS on neurons in both the primary motor cortex (M1) and the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) during a task in which some trials were instructed with visual cues and other trials with S1-ICMS. Main results. We observed both indirect modulation during and/or after ICMS trains, as well as direct modulation time-locked to the individual S1-ICMS pulses within trains, with all possible combinations of the two types of modulation found among the majority of M1 and PMv neurons. Indirect effects were more prevalent and larger than direct effects. When S1-ICMS produced both indirect and direct modulation in the same neuron, the effects could both be excitatory, both inhibitory, or one excitatory and the other inhibitory. By simulating direct effects, we isolated the concurrent indirect effects, revealing that isolated direct effects failed to account for isolated indirect effects. Furthermore, indirect effects could be present 1 s or more after ICMS trains had terminated, when no direct effects could have occurred. Although the performance of movement decoders trained on visually-instructed trials was poor when applied to ICMS-instructed trials, decoders trained on ICMS-instructed trials performed well on ICMS-instructed trials, indicating that S1-ICMS altered the discharge of M1 and PMv neurons but did not degrade the decodable information available. Significance. When decoding movement intent from neural activity in M1 and/or PMv, accounting for indirect and direct modulation may improve the ability of bidirectional brain\u2013machine interfaces to incorporate artificial somatosensory feedback delivered with S1-ICMS and restore functional movement.",

    "title": "EEG workload estimation and classification: a systematic review",
    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) has evolved into an indispensable instrument for estimating cognitive workload in various domains. Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly employed to develop accurate workload estimation and classification models based on EEG data. The goal of this systematic review is to compile the body of research on EEG workload estimation and classification using ML and DL approaches. Methods. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures were followed in conducting the review, searches were conducted through databases at SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Science Direct from the beginning to the end of 16 February 2024. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted to capture study design, participant demographics, EEG features, ML/DL algorithms, and reported performance metrics. Results. Out of the 125 items that emerged, 33 scientific papers were fully evaluated. The study designs, participant demographics, and EEG workload measurement and categorization techniques used in the investigations differed. Support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and hybrid networks are examples of ML and DL approaches that were often used. Analyzing the accuracy scores achieved by different ML/DL models. Furthermore, a relationship was noted between sample frequency and model accuracy, with higher sample frequencies generally leading to improved performance. The percentage distribution of ML/DL methods revealed that SVMs, CNNs, and recurrent neural networks were the most commonly utilized techniques, reflecting their robustness in handling EEG data. Significance. The comprehensive review emphasizes how ML may be used to identify mental workload across a variety of disciplines using EEG data. Optimizing practical applications requires multimodal data integration, standardization efforts, and real-world validation studies. These systems will also be further improved by addressing ethical issues and investigating new EEG properties, which will improve human\u2013computer interaction and performance assessment.",

    "title": "Identification of modulated whole-brain dynamical models from nonstationary electrophysiological data",
    "content": "Objective. Understanding the mechanisms underlying brain dynamics is a long-held goal in neuroscience. However, these dynamics are both individualized and nonstationary, making modeling challenging. Here, we present a data-driven approach to modeling nonstationary dynamics based on principles of neuromodulation, at the level of individual subjects. Approach. Previously, we developed the mesoscale individualized neural dynamics (MINDy) modeling approach to capture individualized brain dynamics which do not change over time. Here, we extend the MINDy approach by adding a modulatory component which is multiplied by a set of baseline, stationary connectivity weights. We validate this model on both synthetic data and publicly available electroencephalography data in the context of anesthesia, a known modulator of neural dynamics. Main results. We find that our modulated MINDy approach is accurate, individualized, and reliable. Additionally, we find that our models yield biologically interpretable inferences regarding the effects of propofol anesthesia on mesoscale cortical networks, consistent with previous literature on the neuromodulatory effects of propofol. Significance. Ultimately, our data-driven modeling approach is reliable and scalable, and provides insight into mechanisms underlying observed brain dynamics. Our modeling methodology can be used to infer insights about modulation dynamics in the brain in a number of different contexts.",

    "title": "Cognitive performance fatigability, perceived fatigability, and trait fatigue in post-COVID-19 condition: A cross-sectional study.",
    "content": "Objective: Earlier research on fatigue in post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) has mainly studied subjective fatigue, either over a prolonged period (trait fatigue) or in relation to a certain situation (state fatigue) in the form of perceived fatigability. Another aspect of state fatigue, cognitive performance fatigability, defined as a decline in performance over time in cognitively demanding tasks, has not been the focus of PCC research. We aimed to examine performance fatigability and the associations between these three fatigue domains. Method: Thirty-four individuals with PCC and 36 controls who recovered from COVID-19 without PCC performed cognitive tests repeated twice during the test session to assess performance fatigability. Self-reports were used to assess perceived fatigability (repeated Visual Analogue Scales) and trait fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory). Results: Analysis of covariance showed significant interactions in two tests measuring processing speed: coding (<em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = .17) and a speed composite score derived from Color\u2013Word Interference Test (<em>p</em> = .031, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = .08), where the controls improved their performance more on the repeated tests compared with the PCC group, indicating performance fatigability in the PCC group. For the PCC group, no correlations were found between fatigue domains (<em>r</em> < 0.34). Conclusions: The PCC group exhibited performance fatigability in measures of processing speed. There were no correlations between fatigue domains, suggesting that the domains might represent separate constructs. The results highlight the need to differentiate between various types of fatigue in research and clinical practice and to assess performance fatigability in addition to using self-reports to obtain a comprehensive understanding of fatigue and fatigability.

    "content": "Objective: Initial findings indicate that semantic memory retrieval of different categories, such as fruits and animals, is variably impacted in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Importantly, theories of embodied cognition propose that these variances may stem from compromised motor processing in PD patients. Indeed, the conceptual representation of the fruits category may involve aspects of manipulability and graspability, which are less relevant for the animals category. We aimed to assess semantic memory retrieval of fruits versus animals category as assessed by semantic fluency (SF) in PD by using the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Marker Initiative database. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 104 healthy controls (HC), 264 patients with sporadic de novo PD (S-PD), and 57 patients with genetic PD (G-PD). Additionally, we carried out explorative analysis concerning possible differences between S-PD and G-PF on SF. Results: We found lower fruits SF performance in PD (S-PD plus G-PD) compared to HC; however, this score could not classify the two groups. Crucially, no difference for the animals class was found. When analyzing separately S-PD and G-PD, we found that fruits SF in S-PD was lower compared to HC and was negatively associated with S-PD diagnosis. Remarkably, no difference for the animals class was found. We did not find significant SF differences in the G-PD. Moreover, SF scores, regardless of the category, were uncorrelated with dopamine integrity measures and motor symptoms scales. Conclusions: The findings reveal distinct patterns of category dissociation in S-PD and G-PD, suggesting a potential link between category dissociation and motor embodiment processes in PD.

    "content": "Objective: The Modified Taylor Complex Figure\u2013Recognition Trial (MTCF-RT) is a visual recognition memory measure that consists of a recognition trial to be administered after the copy and the delayed reproduction of the Modified Taylor Complex Figure Test. The aim of this study was to validate the MTCF-RT in differentiating amnestic patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) from patients with memory deficits due to Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) or subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD). Method: The MTCF-RT was administered to 25 amnestic patients with AD and 25 patients with memory deficits due to SIVD (<em>n</em> = 18) or PD (<em>n</em> = 7). Additionally, the recognition trial was administered to 40 neurologically unimpaired individuals. All patients were tested on a brief neuropsychological battery, and their magnetic resonance scans were assessed for medial temporal lobe atrophy. Results: MTCF-RT performance was significantly lower in the group of amnestic patients with AD than in the group of amnestic patients with non-AD disorders, whereas healthy subjects performed significantly better than the two experimental groups. The MTCF-RT allowed identifying amnestic patients with AD with 92% sensitivity and 96% specificity using a cutoff of \u22647.358, showing a higher discriminant power with respect to other long-term memory measures. Finally, MTCF-RT scores showed a high negative correlation with medial temporal lobe atrophy and a positive correlation with other long-term memory measures. Conclusions: MTCF-RT could be a useful tool, as part of a larger neuropsychological battery, for discriminating patients with AD from those with memory deficits due to PD or SIVD.

    "content": "Objective: The treatment of dementia is increasingly likely to focus on dementia-related biomarkers. Unfortunately, there is variability with regard to biomarker-related effects. This analysis tests an algorithm capable of identifying persons adversely impacted by any dementia-related biomarker in this case, amyloidopathy as estimated by positron emission tomography (PET). Method: <em>N</em> = 1,737 subjects of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative were assigned to amyloidopathy-affliction classes. Moderation effects were tested by chi-square difference. Results: 39.3% of subjects with (+) PET results were assigned to the afflicted class. The afflicted subjects had greater dementia severity and higher amyloid burdens. These effects persisted at 36 months. Furthermore, the association between amyloid burden and dementia severity was moderated by affliction class. Afflicted nondemented cases with positive PET findings were more likely to convert to clinical \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d over 48 months, by Cox\u2019s<em> F: F</em>(312, 154) = 1.27, <em>p</em> = .05. PET assessed amyloid burden was not related to dementia severity in resilient PET (+) cases. Conclusion: Our approach could allow for more accurate prediction of biomarker effects and guide precision interventions against specific biomarkers.

    "content": "Objectives: Alzheimer\u2019s disease progresses through several stages, starting with a preclinical phase characterized by subjective cognitive decline (SCD), where individuals express concerns about their memory despite normal cognitive test results. Recent research has indicated subtle semantic difficulties in SCD, prompting the need for a deeper investigation into cognitive processing during this phase. This study aimed to investigate the cognitive processing of famous and unfamiliar faces in individuals with SCD compared to healthy controls, focusing on semantic memory deficits assessment. Method: Twenty-seven participants with SCD and 26 control participants performed a judgment task involving famous and unfamiliar faces while their eye movements were recorded. Mean fixation times, number of revisitations, and number of fixations were analyzed between the two groups. Results: The SCD group exhibited no significant differences in mean fixation times and in the number of revisited regions between famous and unfamiliar faces, in contrast to the control group, which showed distinct patterns in processing these categories of stimuli. Conclusion: These findings suggest that individuals with SCD process famous faces similarly to unfamiliar faces, indicating a potential weakening of semantic processing in SCD. This may have implications for early detection of cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
    "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

    "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

    "content": "Nightmare Distress Questionnaire (NDQ) is commonly used to assess nightmare distress. The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

    "title": "Cognitive training improves executive function and self-efficacy in young women with chronic stroke: a pilot study",
    "content": "IntroductionYoung women are increasingly affected by stroke and often experience persistent executive function deficits that impact global functioning. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a strategy-based cognitive training program (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Training) to improve executive function and related outcomes in young women with stroke.MethodsEight women with chronic-stage stroke (age: M = 38.75 years; SD = \u00b1 8.78) and eight age- and education-matched controls (age: M = 35.75 years; SD \u00b1 7.71) completed 10 sessions of SMART over 5 weeks, with pre- and post- training assessments. Outcomes included measures of executive function (subtests of the BrainHealth Index), daily living skills (Cognitive Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Daily Living Questionnaire, and Community Integration Questionnaire), and psychosocial functioning (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21), as well as feasibility/goodness of fit of the program (Acceptability of Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure, and Feasibility of Intervention Measure).ResultsFollowing SMART, participants with stroke demonstrated improvements in aspects of executive function (including abstraction, strategic memory, and fluency of ideas), cognitive self-efficacy, and stress. Control participants also demonstrated gains, particularly in cognitive self-efficacy. Feasibility was rated highly by participants with stroke.DiscussionFindings support SMART as a promising intervention for enhancing cognitive and functional outcomes in young women with stroke, warranting further large-scale investigation.",

    "title": "As time goes by: SMA neuromodulation and time perception while watching moving images with different editing styles. A tDCS study",
    "content": "Within the framework of a \u201cneurofilmological\u201d approach \u2013 which integrates film studies, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience \u2013 the present study explored how cinematographic editing influences the viewer\u2019s perception of time. Previous behavioral research has shown that editing density affects temporal judgments. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship, we examined the role of motor system activity, specifically the supplementary motor area (SMA), in time perception when individuals are exposed to moving images with different cinematographic editing styles. Forty-eight university students were assigned to one of three tDCS conditions (anodal, cathodal, or sham). They viewed nine silent video clips with different editing styles (master shot, slow-paced, fast-paced) that were specifically created for research. The participants rated perceived duration, time passage, action speed, and emotional engagement, while tDCS was applied for 20 min targeting the SMA. The results revealed that SMA excitability modulation affected duration estimates, time passage, and action speed judgments by interacting with the editing style of the clips. These findings highlight the importance of the SMA in modulating time perception during film viewing. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms that shape the viewer\u2019s perception of film time as an integral part of experiencing movement in cinema.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

These observations suggest an opportunity to move beyond direct visual translation and toward a tactile-first design approach. We outline a speculative tactile design framework that explores how data analysis tasks may align with tactile strategies and encoding choices. While this framework is not yet validated, it offers a lens for generating tactile-first chart designs and sets the stage for future empirical exploration. We present speculative mockups to illustrate how the Tactile Perceptual Grammar might guide the design of an accessible COVID-19 dashboard. This scenario illustrates how the grammar can guide encoding choices that better support comparison, trend detection, and proportion estimation in tactile formats. We conclude with design implications and a discussion of future validation through co-design and task-based evaluation.",

Recent work has explored how VR can be adapted and tailored to individual users. However, existing reviews tend to address either user-state sensing or adaptive interaction design in isolation, limiting our understanding of their combined implementation in VR. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the growing research on personalized interaction in VR, with a particular focus on utilizing participants' immersion information and adaptation mechanisms to modify virtual environments and enhance engagement, performance, or a specific goal. We synthesize findings from studies that employ adaptive techniques across diverse application domains and summarize a five-stage conceptual framework that unifies adaptive mechanisms across domains. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including the integration of multimodal sensors, an increasing reliance on user state inference, and the challenge of balancing responsiveness with transparency. We conclude by proposing future directions for developing more user-centered VR systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.13091v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Online freelance marketplaces, a rapidly growing part of the global labor market, are creating a fair environment where professional skills are the main factor for hiring. While these platforms can reduce bias from traditional hiring, the personal information in user profiles raises concerns about ongoing discrimination. Past studies on this topic have mostly used existing data, which makes it hard to control for other factors and clearly see the effect of things like gender or race. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new method that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create realistic, artificial freelancer profiles for controlled experiments. This approach effectively separates individual factors, enabling a clearer statistical analysis of how different variables influence the freelancer project process. In addition to analyzing extracted data with traditional statistical methods for post-project stage analysis, our research utilizes a dataset with highly controlled variables, generated by an RAG-LLM, to conduct a simulated hiring experiment for pre-project stage analysis. The results of our experiments show that, regarding gender, while no significant preference emerged in initial hiring decisions, female freelancers are substantially more likely to receive imperfect ratings post-project stage. Regarding regional bias, a strong and consistent preference favoring US-based freelancers shows that people are more likely to be selected in the simulated experiments, perceived as more leader-like, and receive higher ratings on the live platform.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.13009v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As the use of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly global, understanding public attitudes toward these systems requires tools that are adapted to local contexts and languages. In the Arab world, LLM adoption has grown rapidly with both globally dominant platforms and regional ones like Fanar and Jais offering Arabic-specific solutions. This highlights the need for culturally and linguistically relevant scales to accurately measure attitudes toward LLMs in the region. Tools assessing attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a base for measuring attitudes specific to LLMs. The 5-item Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, which measures two dimensions, the AI Fear and the AI Acceptance, has been recently adopted and adapted to develop new instruments in English using a sample from the UK: the Attitudes Toward General LLMs (AT-GLLM) and Attitudes Toward Primary LLM (AT-PLLM) scales. In this paper, we translate the two scales, AT-GLLM and AT-PLLM, and validate them using a sample of 249 Arabic-speaking adults. The results show that the scale, translated into Arabic, is a reliable and valid tool that can be used for the Arab population and language. Psychometric analyses confirmed a two-factor structure, strong measurement invariance across genders, and good internal reliability. The scales also demonstrated strong convergent and discriminant validity. Our scales will support research in a non-Western context, a much-needed effort to help draw a global picture of LLM perceptions, and will also facilitate localized research and policy-making in the Arab region.",

Existing fatigue detection approaches rely on subjective questionnaires or intrusive physiological signals, such as EEG, heart rate, or eye-blink count, which limit their scalability and real-time applicability. This paper introduces a deep learning-based study for detecting visual fatigue using continuous eye-gaze trajectories recorded in VR. We use the GazeBaseVR dataset comprising binocular eye-tracking data from 407 participants across five immersive tasks, extract cyclopean eye-gaze angles, and evaluate six deep classifiers. Our results demonstrate that EKYT achieves up to 94% accuracy, particularly in tasks demanding high visual attention, such as video viewing and text reading. We further analyze gaze variance and subjective fatigue measures, indicating significant behavioral differences between fatigued and non-fatigued conditions. These findings establish eye-gaze dynamics as a reliable and nonintrusive modality for continuous fatigue detection in immersive VR, offering practical implications for adaptive human-computer interactions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.12988v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As virtual reality (VR) devices become increasingly integrated into everyday settings, a growing number of users without prior experience will engage with VR systems. Automatically detecting a user's familiarity with VR as an interaction medium enables real-time, adaptive training and interface adjustments, minimizing user frustration and improving task performance. In this study, we explore the automatic detection of VR familiarity by analyzing hand movement patterns during a passcode-based door-opening task, which is a well-known interaction in collaborative virtual environments such as meeting rooms, offices, and healthcare spaces. While novice users may lack prior VR experience, they are likely to be familiar with analogous real-world tasks involving keypad entry. We conducted a pilot study with 26 participants, evenly split between experienced and inexperienced VR users, who performed tasks using both controller-based and hand-tracking interactions. Our approach uses state-of-the-art deep classifiers for automatic VR familiarity detection, achieving the highest accuracies of 92.05% and 83.42% for hand-tracking and controller-based interactions, respectively. In the cross-device evaluation, where classifiers trained on controller data were tested using hand-tracking data, the model achieved an accuracy of 78.89%. The integration of both modalities in the mixed-device evaluation obtained an accuracy of 94.19%. Our results underline the promise of using hand movement biometrics for the real-time detection of user familiarity in critical VR applications, paving the way for personalized and adaptive VR experiences.",

Both groups completed three sessions, each focused on one digital stress component: availability demand stress, approval anxiety, and fear of missing out. A digital literacy group received similar content and quizzes, and a control group. Outcomes measured included digital stress, problematic social media use, word-of-mouth about its management, and issue involvement. Findings highlight the challenge of translating cognitive engagement into behavioural change, especially amid persistent digital habits and socially reinforced stressors. Results offer insights into the limitations of interventions based on the prot\\'eg\\'ee effect when applied to behaviour change, particularly in the context of reflective digital wellbeing strategies.

    "content": "arXiv:2510.08436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: During slow-wave sleep, the brain produces traveling waves of slow oscillations (SOs; $\\leq 2$ Hz), characterized by the propagation of alternating high- and low-activity states. The question of internal mechanisms that modulate traveling waves of SOs is still unanswered although it is established that it is an adaptation mechanism that mediates them. One mechanism investigated is spike-frequency adaptation, a hyperpolarizing feedback current that is activated during periods of high-activity. An alternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which are positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both adaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal populations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable differences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a spatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial coupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two adaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and include the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength and gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent under a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength, leading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation structure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves. Additionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal activity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of the traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength. Though being dynamically equivalent, our results also explain why location-dependent variations in feedback strength cause differences in the propagation of traveling waves between both adaptation mechanisms.",

This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.",

The normative framework of a Bayesian observer model can account for this phenomenon, yet most formulations treat it as given rather than explaining its emergence through learning. We introduce a Generative Adversarial Inference (GAI) network that acquires latent representations and inference strategies directly from sensory inputs, without hand-crafted likelihoods or priors. Trained using adversarial learning with reconstruction on Gabor stimuli under varying uncertainty, the network learns to recover underlying stimuli from noisy inputs, and spontaneously reproduces the bias reversal observed in human perception. This emergent behavior arises from network responses that reveal signatures of efficient coding and Bayesian inference. Our findings provide an end-to-end account of perceptual bias that unifies normative theory and deep learning.",

    "title": "Data-Driven Reduced Modeling of Recurrent Neural Networks",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.13519v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience to model the collective activity of neurons during behavioral tasks. The high dimensionality of their parameter and activity spaces, however, often make it challenging to infer and interpret the fundamental features of their dynamics.\n  In this study, we employ recent nonlinear dynamical system techniques to uncover the core dynamics of several RNNs used in contemporary neuroscience. Specifically, using a data-driven approach, we identify Spectral Submanifolds (SSMs), i.e., low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds tangent to the eigenspaces of fixed points. The internal dynamics of SSMs serve as nonlinear models that reduce the dimensionality of the full RNNs by orders of magnitude.\n  Through low-dimensional, SSM-reduced models, we give mathematically precise definitions of line and ring attractors, which are intuitive concepts commonly used to explain decision-making and working memory. The new level of understanding of RNNs obtained from SSM reduction enables the interpretation of mathematically well-defined and robust structures in neuronal dynamics, leading to novel predictions about the neural computations underlying behavior.",

    "title": "Jacobian-Based Interpretation of Nonlinear Neural Encoding Model",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.13688v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, the alignment between artificial neural network (ANN) embeddings and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) via neural encoding models has significantly advanced research on neural representation mechanisms and interpretability in the brain. However, these approaches remain limited in characterizing the brain's inherently nonlinear response properties. To address this, we propose the Jacobian-based Nonlinearity Evaluation (JNE), an interpretability metric for nonlinear neural encoding models. JNE quantifies nonlinearity by statistically measuring the dispersion of local linear mappings (Jacobians) from model representations to predicted BOLD responses, thereby approximating the nonlinearity of BOLD signals. Centered on proposing JNE as a novel interpretability metric, we validated its effectiveness through controlled simulation experiments on various activation functions and network architectures, and further verified it on real fMRI data, demonstrating a hierarchical progression of nonlinear characteristics from primary to higher-order visual cortices, consistent with established cortical organization. We further extended JNE with Sample-Specificity (JNE-SS), revealing stimulus-selective nonlinear response patterns in functionally specialized brain regions. As the first interpretability metric for quantifying nonlinear responses, JNE provides new insights into brain information processing. Code available at https://github.com/Gaitxh/JNE.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.13156v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The theta rhythm is important for many cognitive functions including spatial processing, memory encoding, and memory recall. The information processing underlying these functions is thought to rely on consistent, phase-specific spiking throughout a theta oscillation that may fluctuate significantly in baseline (center of oscillations), frequency, or amplitude. Experimental evidence shows that spikes can occur at specific phases even when the baseline membrane potential varies significantly, such that the integrity of phase-locking persists across a large variability in spike threshold. The mechanism of this precise spike timing during the theta rhythm is not yet known and previous mathematical models have not reflected the large variability in threshold potential seen experimentally. Here we introduce a straightforward mathematical neural model capable of demonstrating a phase-locked spiking in the face of significant baseline membrane potential fluctuation during theta rhythm. This novel approach incorporates a degenerate grazing bifurcation of an asymptotically stable oscillation. This model suggests a potential mechanism for how biological neurons can consistently produce spikes near the peak of a variable membrane potential oscillation.",

    "content": "Immunohistochemistry for amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptide is an indispensable method for Alzheimers disease (AD) research. Despite a wide variety of available antibodies against the peptides, the difference of immunohistochemical reactivity is not fully described among anti-A{beta} antibodies. Immunohistochemical reactivity of Abs against A{beta} peptides is critical for accurate and reliable evaluation of A{beta} burden in patients as well as models of AD. Here, we examined immunohistochemical reactivity of two mouse and one rabbit monoclonal antibodies against A{beta} N-terminal regions using two AD mouse models, AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F. 6E10, 82E1 and D54D2 A{beta} antibodies were used in this study. We found significant differences in the immunohistochemical reactivity in both AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F models. While 6E10 immunoreactivity was mainly localized to A{beta} plaques, D54D2 and 82E1 antibodies stained much more broadly beyond plaques. Interestingly, the latter two Abs showed blurred filamentous immunoreactivity beyond amyloid plaque cores. Double immunostaining using a tyramide signal amplification method, Fluorochromized Tyramide-Glucose Oxidase (FT-GO), suggested that the differential immunohistochemical outcomes were only partially attributable to their sensitivity. Moreover, heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER) did not affect the differential immunohistochemical outcomes. Our analysis indicates that outcomes of A{beta} immunohistochemistry highly depends on the antibody used in the study.",

    "title": "Hippocampal grey matter changes across scales in Alzheimer's Disease",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by deterioration in cognitive function including extensive memory impairment. The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe region, is a key orchestrator in the encoding and retrieval of memory and is believed to be one of the first regions to deteriorate in AD. In this work we examined hippocampal macrostructure (specifically gyrification and thickness) and microstructure in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relative to healthy aged controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We first utilized an iterative training paradigm to adapt an existing deep learning approach for capturing hippocampal topology to elderly individuals as well as individuals with potential hippocampal degeneration. Using this new model, we found notable decreases in both thickness and gyrification in AD and MCI across both the subfields and anterior-posterior axis. Using the diffusion tensor representation derived from diffusion MRI data, we found significant increases in the mean diffusivity across the extent of the hippocampus in AD and MCI, which may be related to a number of changes such as loss of neuronal cells, decreased fiber density, demyelination, and increased presence of CSF. Examining the primary direction of diffusion relative to canonical hippocampal axes, we found distinct diffusion orientation shifts in AD and MCI throughout the anterior-posterior extent of the subiculum and CA1. Specifically, we found a decrease in diffusion oriented tangentially, and an increase in diffusion oriented along the long-axis. This could potentially be related to the known degeneration of the perforant path, which is greatly affected in AD and is a largely tangential oriented pathway. The AD-related changes in diffusion orientations were found to not have significant spatial overlap with AD-related changes in mean diffusivity, suggesting that they may be capturing distinct spatially-localized disease processes. Finally, we showed that the macro- and microstructure of the hippocampus in AD changed less across age relative to MCI and controls. As well, the age-related hippocampal macrostructure changes in MCI appeared indistinguishable from healthy aging.",

    "content": "RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) is a repressor of transcriptional initiation of genes involved in neurogenesis. Here, we show that conditional REST elevation in cerebellar granule cell progenitors (CGNPs) of RESTTG mice perturbed foliation, increased cell migration, and sustained C-X-C motif receptor 4 (Cxcr4) signaling, a pathway key to postnatal CGNP migration. Mechanistic studies uncovered a novel role for REST in controlling transcript diversity and exon skipping in CGNPs. Alternative transcript expression was detected in known Cxcr4 signaling regulator, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-6 (Grk6). Further analysis of Grk6 isoform expression revealed an upregulation of a transcript lacking exon 10a (Grk6-207) in RESTTG CGNPs. Grk6-207 expression in wildtype CGNPs hyperactivated Cxcr4 signaling and increased chemotaxis. Structural modeling of Grk6-207 predicted changes in active site conformation and interactions with Cxcr4 and {beta}-Arrestin-1, supporting impairment of Cxcr4 signaling desensitization. Interestingly, REST elevation promoted increased chromatin accessibility at the exon10a-10b junction and exon 10a exclusion. Integrated multiomic analyses identified the enhancer of zeste (Ezh2) as a potential mediator of alternative transcript generation which demonstrated increased occupancy at the exon10a-10b locus in RESTTG CGNPs. Pharmacological inhibition of Ezh2 downregulated Grk6-207, confirming a role for Ezh2 in Grk6 exon10a exclusion and the increased migration in RESTTG CGNPs.",

    "title": "An EEG Investigation of Neural Dynamics of Empathy Influenced by Congruent and Incongruent Pain Expressions in Autistic and Neurotypical Adults",
    "content": "Autistic individuals often show difficulties in empathy, but the underlying neural mechanisms of empathy in naturalistic contexts of pain have been less examined. This study employed a kinetic pain empathy paradigm, manipulating the congruence between pain expressions, i.e., body gestures and facial expressions based on a predictive coding framework. We collected EEG data from 51 autistic and 58 neurotypical adults during a pain observation task. Results indicated that autistic and neurotypical adults share a similar neural architecture for empathy processing and conflict resolution, involving an early stage of sensory arousal (i.e., N2 and theta) and a later stage of cognitive reappraisal (i.e., P3). However, the multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed nuanced but significant between-group differences in neural patterns. Compared to neurotypical peers, autistic adults demonstrated atypical processes in both empathy and conflict resolution. Specifically, they exhibited heightened early emotional arousal but expended greater cognitive effort to evaluate others' pain. Autistic adults also showed increased alertness to unexpected sensory input and allocated more cognitive resources to resolve prediction errors from incongruent pairings. In contrast, neurotypical adults suppressed unnecessary cognitive efforts for meaningless errors. In summary, autistic adults may experience challenges in efficiently adjusting predictions to the external context, with their neural processing heavily depending on sensory input and less efficient in adapting cognitive resources to evaluate and respond to varied contextual demands.",
