Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance.

This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

Recent developments in wearable MEG sensors hold potential to overcome this limitation, as they allow the placement of sensors closer to the cerebellum.MethodsWe leveraged the development of wearable optically pumped magnetometers to record on-scalp MEG (OP-MEG) during an established cerebellar learning paradigm\u2014eyeblink conditioning. In four healthy human adults, we first validated that OP-MEG can reliably detect cerebellar responses by examining responses to an air puff stimulus.ResultsSignificant responses were observed in sensors positioned over the cerebellar region in all four adults in response to the air puff. We then indirectly tested the hypothesis that these responses reflect the population-level spiking activity of Purkinje cells. The air-puff\u2013evoked responses diminished during the acquisition of conditioned responses, corresponding with previously observed changes in Purkinje cell activity in animals. Additionally, in three out of four participants, we observed a cerebellar evoked response just prior to the peak of the conditioned blink, resembling learning-associated shifts in Purkinje cell response latencies.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that OP-MEG is a viable method for recording cerebellar activity in humans. By bridging invasive animal recordings with non-invasive human neuroimaging, these findings provide further evidence of the cerebellum\u2019s role in human learning.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the cortical task-specific response patterns underlying the improvement of upper limb dysfunction in stroke patients using transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) paired with task-oriented training (TOT) under varying cognitive loads.MethodsIn this randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled trial, 30 patients with subacute stroke were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the taVNS group or the Sham group. Both groups received 3 weeks of TOT. The taVNS group received concurrent active taVNS, while the Sham group received concurrent sham stimulation. Assessments were performed pre- and post-intervention. Clinical function was evaluated using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Modified Barthel Index (MBI). Neurophysiological measures included heart rate variability (HRV) to assess taVNS efficacy and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to assess cortical excitability changes. Brain functional imaging was conducted using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during motor tasks with different cognitive loads (low-load: continuous horizontal movement; high-load: goal-directed movement) to analyze changes in spontaneous neural activity, task-related regional brain activation characteristics, and brain functional network alterations.Results(1) Post-intervention, the taVNS group showed significantly greater improvements in all HRV indices compared to the Sham group (P < 0.05). (2) Both groups exhibited significant improvements from baseline in FMA-UE, MoCA, MBI, and FSS scores (P < 0.05), with the taVNS group demonstrating significantly greater improvement than the Sham group (P < 0.05). (3) MEP results indicated significant improvements in the elicitation rate of ipsilesional MEPs within the taVNS group post-intervention (P < 0.05). Furthermore, compared to the Sham group, the taVNS group showed significantly greater improvements in the ipsilesional MEP elicitation rate and a significant reduction in contralesional MEP latency (P < 0.05). (4) Regarding resting-state fNIRS, the taVNS group exhibited higher Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF) values post-intervention in the ipsilesional prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and sensorimotor cortex (SMC) compared to the Sham group (P < 0.05), but these differences were not significant after correction. In task-state fNIR under the low-cognitive-load condition, activation levels in the ipsilesionalS primary motor cortex (M1) and premotor and supplementary motor areas (pSMA) were significantly higher in the taVNS group compared to the Sham group post-intervention (PFDR < 0.05). During the high-cognitive-load task, activation levels in the ipsilesional PFC and DLPFC were significantly higher in the taVNS group compared to the Sham group post-intervention (PFDR < 0.05). (5) Functional network analysis using complex network metrics revealed that the taVNS group exhibited significantly increased nodal clustering coefficient and nodal local efficiency in the ipsilesional DLPFC during the high-cognitive-load task post-intervention compared to the Sham group (PFDR < 0.05).ConclusiontaVNS paired with TOT enhances autonomic homeostasis, increases corticospinal pathway excitability, activates cognition-motor related brain regions, and modulates functional connectivity networks through multi-pathway neuroregulatory mechanisms. This promotes the formation of task-specific cortical activation and network connectivity during motor tasks under varying cognitive demands in stroke patients. These changes contribute to improved executive control performance in complex tasks, thereby enhancing cognitive-motor integration capabilities and facilitating upper limb functional recovery.Clinical Trial Registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/index.html, Unique Identifier/Registration Number: ChiCTR2400085163.",

    "content": "With the rapid development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, the effective integration of multimodal biological signals to improve classification accuracy has become a research hotspot. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit cross-modality correlations in complex cognitive tasks. To address this, this paper proposes a Multi-Branch Convolutional Neural Network with Attention (MBC-ATT) for BCI based cognitive tasks classification. MBC-ATT employs independent branch structures to process electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals separately, thereby leveraging the advantages of each modality. To further enhance the fusion of multimodal features, we introduce a cross-modal attention mechanism to discriminate features, strengthening the model's ability to focus on relevant signals and thereby improving classification accuracy. We conducted experiments on the n-back and WG datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms conventional approaches in classification performance, further validating the effectiveness of MBC-ATT in brain-computer interfaces. This study not only provides novel insights for multimodal BCI systems but also holds great potential for various applications.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe nocebo effect, where negative responses can occur as a result of negative expectations, has gained increasing attention in motor control research, with growing evidence highlighting its impact on both athletic and everyday movements. However, the specific methodologies used to induce nocebo effects on motor outcomes remain unexplored. This scoping review aimed to address three key questions: (1) What experimental protocols have been developed and used to elicit nocebo effects in motor performance in healthy individuals? (2) How are these effects assessed and measured? (3) What are the observed effects on motor outcomes?MethodsA scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA framework, searching PubMed, EBSCO, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception to March 2025. Eighteen studies were included.Results and discussionVerbal instruction was the most common induction method (94.4 %), often combined with conditioning or visual cues. Motor tasks assessed gross skills, such as sprinting and cycling), with limited attention given to fine motor control. Outcomes were more frequently centered on performance measures (e.g., strength, endurance), with less emphasis on movement quality (e.g., coordination). Nocebo effects were observed in half of the studies impairing motor performance, including reduced force production, diminished endurance, disrupted postural stability and slower movement speed. The findings highlight methodological diversity in induction protocols and measurement methods. Future research should expand participant diversity, investigate fine motor tasks, and further explore the interplay between induction methods and motor outcomes.",

The patient\u2019s past medical history reported proton therapy for an VIII cranial nerve Schwannoma. Here, we aimed to investigate the potential alterations involving tracts and nuclei composing the dentato-rubro-olivary pathway (Guillain-Mollaret triangle) using an advanced ultra-high field (7\u202fT) MRI protocol.Materials and methodsThe patient underwent a 7\u202fT-MRI brain exam, including a multi-echo gradient-echo sequence for quantitative susceptibility mapping and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The DTI dataset was elaborated for tractography and computation of tensor metrics.Results7\u202fT-MRI allowed the depiction of the brainstem tracts and nuclei composing the Guillain-Mollaret triangle. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of these structures demonstrated damage to the right red nucleus and the dentato-rubral tracts bilaterally. These findings are consistent with the pathophysiology of HOD and were confirmed in a follow-up MRI.DiscussionThis study highlights the capability of 7\u202fT-MRI to depict and investigate brainstem substructures such as tracts and nuclei.

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine changes in brain functional activity following acupuncture treatment for acute Bell\u2019s palsy (BP) and to investigate the potential central regulatory mechanisms involved.MethodsA total of 55 patients with acute Bell\u2019s facial paralysis (within 1\u20137 days of onset) were enrolled in the patient group, while 48 individuals without the condition were included as the healthy control group. The patient group received acupuncture therapy at EX-HN16 (Qianzheng), SJ17 (Yifeng), ST2 (Sibai), GB14 (Yangbai), EX-HN4 (Yuyao), SI18 (Quanliao), ST6 (Jiache), ST4 (Dicang), ST8 (Touwei), and bilateral LI4 (Hegu) points on the affected side. Each session lasted 30 min and was administered three times a week (Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday) until day 28 of the disease course. The patient group underwent fMRI scans, House\u2013Brackmann (H-B) grading, Sunnybrook scale evaluation, and facial disability index (FDI) assessment both prior to the initial treatment and on the 28th day. The healthy group received a single fMRI scan after enrollment. MATLAB R2017 software was used to calculate the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) in patients before and after treatment, as well as in healthy controls.ResultsFollowing treatment, the patient group showed significant improvements in H-B, Sunnybrook, and FDI scores compared to pretreatment levels (P < 0.05), with an overall effective rate of 96.4% (53/55). Prior to treatment, compared to healthy controls, patients exhibited decreased fALFF in the right posterior cingulate gyrus, increased fALFF in the right postcentral gyrus, left and right middle frontal gyri, and increased ReHo in the left precentral gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, and left middle occipital gyrus. After treatment, when compared to healthy controls, patients showed decreased fALFF in the left and right medial superior frontal gyri, and increased fALFF in the right postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and bilateral lingual gyri, and increased ReHo in the right precentral gyrus, bilateral transverse temporal gyri, right lingual gyrus, and right thalamus, and decreased ReHo in the right middle frontal gyrus. Relative to pretreatment values, patients displayed decreased fALFF in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and increased fALFF in the left precentral gyrus. Additionally, ReHo decreased the right and left medial superior frontal gyri, while it increased in the right inferior parietal angular gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and left superior parietal gyrus.ConclusionAcupuncture demonstrates a clear therapeutic effect on acute BP and contribute to clinical symptom improvement. Marked differences in brain functional activity were observed between patients and healthy individuals. The therapeutic effect of acupuncture may be linked to its ability to facilitate functional reorganization in brain regions associated with sensation, movement, and emotion.Clinical trial registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/searchproj.html? title=&amp;officialname=&amp;subjectid=&amp;regstatus=&amp;regno=ChiCTR2200065223& secondaryid=&amp;applier=&amp;studyleader=&amp;createyear=&amp;sponsor=&amp;secsponsor= &amp;sourceofspends=&amp;studyailment=&amp;studyailmentcode=&amp;studytype=&amp;study stage=&amp;studydesign=&amp;recruitmentstatus=&amp;gender=&amp;agreetosign=&amp;measure= &amp;country=&amp;province=&amp;city=&amp;institution=&amp;institutionlevel=&amp;intercode=& ethicalcommitteesanction=&amp;whetherpublic=&amp;minstudyexecutetime=&amp;maxstudy executetime=&amp;btngo=btn, identifier ChiCTR2200065223.",

    "title": "An ICA-based artifact suppression method for online extraction of TMS-evoked potentials: toward closed-loop TMS-EEG applications beyond the motor cortex",
    "content": "Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has become a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, TMS-EEG signals often suffer from severe artifacts, particularly in lateral cortical regions where TMS-evoked muscle artifacts are pronounced, making real-time recovery of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) challenging. We developed and validated a real-time, two-step independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact cleaning method for TMS-EEG signals, facilitating the rapid extraction of clean neural signals for closed-loop neurostimulation applications. Approach. Our method involves an offline ICA training phase, where ICA weights and artifact topographies are identified using pre-experimental trials, followed by an online phase in which the precomputed weight matrices are applied in real-time to incoming data. We conducted simulations on two pre-published TMS-EEG datasets (N = 28, ROIs = 6) to validate the method by identifying the minimum number of trials required to estimate ICA weights. We also assessed the reproducibility of TEPs and the stability of ICA components, taking classical offline TEPs as the relative ground truth. Main Results. ICA analysis suggests that it can be applied reliably within each region without significant loss of convergence and stability, provided careful consideration is given to the size and composition of the data used for ICA training. Simulation results indicated that while central regions could achieve reliable TEPs similar to ground truth with as few as 20\u201330 trials to train ICA in the pre-experimental phase, frontal and occipital regions required 50\u201360 trials to reach a comparable level of reliability. Later TEP peaks (>100 ms) in all regions achieved high reproducibility when at least 35 training trials were used, whereas earlier peaks (<80 ms) showed moderate reproducibility with the same number of trials. Significance. These findings establish the feasibility and proof-of-concept for real-time ICA-based artifact removal for closed-loop TMS-EEG applications. The method enables rapid extraction of clean neural signals, allowing adaptation of stimulation parameters in real time, thereby facilitating individualized neurostimulation paradigms.",

    "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

    "title": "Closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum modulation depth in temporal interference electrical brain stimulation",
    "content": "Objective. In temporal interference (TI) transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), an emerging brain stimulation technique, the interference of two high-frequency currents with a small frequency difference is used to target specific brain regions with better focality than in standard tES. While the magnitude of the modulation depth has been previously investigated, an explicit formula for the direction in which this modulation is maximized has been lacking. This work provides a novel closed-form analytical expression for the orientation of maximum modulation depth in TI tES. We also found a secondary orientation where the modulation depth has a local maximum. Moreover, we provide closed-form analytical formulas for this orientation as well as for the modulation depth along this orientation. To our knowledge, these closed-form expressions and the presence of the secondary maximum have not been previously reported. Approach. We derive compact analytical expressions and validate them through comprehensive computational simulations using a realistic human head model. We also provide a complete analytical derivation of the widely used formula for the maximum modulation depth magnitude stated in Grossman et al, 2017. Main results. Our simulations demonstrate that the modulation depth predicted with our new analytical direction formula is indeed the maximum compared to other directions. The derived closed-form expression provides a faster and more accurate alternative to iterative numerical optimization methods used in previous studies to estimate this direction. Furthermore, we found that due to interference in 3D, the modulation depth along the secondary maximum orientation can be of similar strength to the maximum modulation depth intensity when interfering electric field vectors are significantly misaligned. Finally, we show that by modifying the ratio of the injected current strengths, it is possible to steer these directions and fine-tune the stimulation along a desired direction of interest. Significance. Overall, this work provides a detailed treatment of TI electric fields in 3D. The presented closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum and secondary maximum modulation depths are relevant for the better interpretation of both simulated and experimental results in TI studies by allowing comparison with neuronal orientations in the brain.",

    "title": "Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy",
    "content": "Objective. The anti-correlation between the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) is a stable characteristic of normal brain activity. However, in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), this anti-correlation is often disrupted and strongly associated with epileptic seizures. This study aims to use periodic spatiotemporal patterns (PSTP) analysis to elucidate the relationship between the DMN-TPN anti-correlation and epileptic activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying IGE. Approach. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyze PSTP in both healthy controls and IGE patients. A pattern-finding algorithm was initially applied to identify repeated spatiotemporal patterns, followed by a novel PSTP-finding algorithm to uncover dynamic periodic patterns through analysis of fluctuations in the DMN-TPN anti-correlation. The Hilbert transform was applied to capture the underlying basic states of these periodic patterns. Additionally, the relationship between period length and intrinsic neural timescales (INT) was explored. Main results. IGE patients exhibited a reduced DMN-TPN anti-correlation, particularly during TPN-dominant states. Additionally, IGE patients exhibited greater dynamic instability in basic states, marked by more frequent transitions between transitional states. Furthermore, lower correlations between period length and INT were observed in cognitive regions of IGE patients. Significance. These findings suggest that dynamic switching between the DMN and TPN in IGE is weaker and less balanced, with disruptions in periodic rhythms linked to cognitive impairments. The proposed PSTP framework provides new insights into the abnormal rhythms of IGE from a spatiotemporal perspective.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "Maximizing theoretical and practical storage capacity in single-layer feedforward neural networks",
    "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

    "title": "Temporal basis function models for closed-loop neural stimulation",
    "content": "Objective. Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Further advancements are required to address a number of difficulties with translating AI to this domain, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. Approach. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials measured in two non-human primates. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient ( \u2009min of training data), rapid to train ( \u2009min), and low latency ( \u2009ms) on desktop CPUs. Main results. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. Surprisingly, on test sets it achieved a prediction accuracy 44% higher than a complex nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and 158% higher than a linear state-space model requiring 90\u2009min to train. Additionally, in two simulations we show that it successfully allows a closed-loop stimulator to drive neural trajectories, and to achieve the user-preferred trade-offs between under- and over-stimulation, given the uncertainty in the model; it achieves an area under curve of \u223c0.7 in both cases. Significance. By optimizing for sample efficiency, training time, and latency, our approach begins to bridge the gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.",

    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
    "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

We aim to assess the independent and combined effects of smoking and COPD on BMI trajectories. 27,651 patients without COPD and 25,990 with COPD from The...",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "content": "Cisplatin is a widely used and effective anticancer drug. However, it causes permanent sensorineural hearing loss in over 50% of treated patients. There are no FDA-approved therapies to prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL) in adults, highlighting a critical unmet clinical need. Previous studies suggest that statins, commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs, are associated with reduced incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Statins are primarily used to lower cholesterol, but they also exert several pleiotropic effects, making the mechanism(s) underlying this protection unclear. Here we examine whether reduced plasma cholesterol confers protection against CIHL independent of statin treatment. We utilized mice lacking serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9 knockout (KO) mice) as a genetic model of reduced plasma cholesterol. We find that Pcsk9 KO mice are protected against cisplatin-induced hearing loss, as reflected by significantly lower ABR and DPOAE threshold shifts relative to wild type (WT) mice following treatment. Histological analyses confirmed preservation of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) in Pcsk9 KO mice treated with cisplatin, whereas WT mice showed significant OHC loss in the high-frequency cochlear regions. Finally, hearing loss positively correlated with baseline plasma cholesterol levels. Together our data demonstrate that systemic cholesterol reduction provides significant protection against CIHL, and they suggest that the protective effect of statins against CIHL is mediated by cholesterol reduction.",

However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning...",

    "title": "Anomalous experiences are associated with high subconscious connectedness.",
    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

    "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects.

We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA).

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

The student network adopts a Temporal Convolutional Network\u2013LSTM (TCN\u2013LSTM) design, integrating dilated causal convolutions and two LSTM layers for efficient temporal modeling. Historical ADS-B trajectory data from Zhuhai Jinwan Airport are preprocessed using cubic spline interpolation and a uniform-step sliding window to ensure data alignment and temporal consistency. In the distillation process, soft labels from the teacher and hard labels from actual observations jointly guide student trainingResultsIn multi-step prediction experiments, the distilled RCBAM\u2013TCN\u2013LSTM model achieved average reductions of 40%\u201360% in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE compared with the original RCBAM and TCN\u2013LSTM models, while improving R\u00b2 by 4%\u20136%.

    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

    "title": "Systematic review of experimental studies in humans on transcranial temporal interference stimulation",
    "content": "Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation method aimed at reaching deeper brain regions than conventional techniques. However, many questions about its effects remain, requiring further experimental studies. This review consolidates the experimental literature on tTIS\u2019s effects in the human brain, clarifies existing evidence, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes future research directions to evaluate its potential. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published up to 27 January 2025. Eligible studies applied tTIS to the human brain and examined its effects on neural, behavioral, and clinical outcomes. Of 127 publications screened, 18 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were analyzed for design, stimulation target, parameters, control conditions, and outcome measures. Included studies exhibited low bias or minor concerns using the Cochrane RoB2 and ROBINS-I tools. Ten studies targeted cortical regions (motor, occipito-parietal, fronto-parietal), and eight probed subcortical sites (striatum, hippocampus, globus pallidus, caudate). Motor-cortex tTIS enhanced motor-network connectivity, though the effect was similar to that of transcranial direct current stimulation. Beta-band stimulation envelopes (20\u2009Hz) promoted learning-related plasticity, while gamma-band envelopes (70\u2009Hz) yielded immediate performance improvements. Occipito-parietal tTIS did not modulate alpha power. Preliminary deep-target findings are promising: 5 Hz hippocampal tTIS improved episodic recall, 100\u2009Hz striatal tTIS enhanced motor learning in older adults, and 100\u2009Hz hippocampal-entorhinal tTIS aided spatial navigation. Two fMRI studies confirmed network-specific modulation, although one raised concerns about using a fixed montage between individuals. Clinical evidence remains limited, with two Parkinson\u2019s pilots and one epilepsy study showing short-term benefits. Overall, tTIS shows potential to modulate human brain activity and behavior. However, current evidence is preliminary and predominantly focused on cortical rather than deep targets. Larger, well-controlled studies are needed to reliably determine whether tTIS can effectively engage subcortical structures and provide meaningful clinical benefits.",

    "content": "Objective. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) scan contains a muscle\u2019s detailed stimulus-activation information and thereby can be used for motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Due to the challenges in accurately obtaining the motor unit numbers from experimental CMAP scans, most existing MUNE methods rely on data fitting, which is time-consuming and requires manual operations. This study explored the feasibility of a neural network-based MUNE approach and proposes an end-to-end model for rapid estimation. Approach. We developed NNEstimation, a novel supervised learning framework based on a convolutional neural network, to estimate motor unit numbers from both synthetic and experimental CMAP scans. A probabilistic model with varied parameters was used to generate CMAP scans with diverse characteristics for neural network training. NNEstimation trained on synthetic data was directly tested on both synthetic and experimental data. Main results. Evaluations on synthetic CMAP scans demonstrate that NNEstimation achieves lower estimation error and shorter execution time than the conventional data fitting method, MScanFit. The accuracy of NNEstimation is influenced by motor unit numbers of CMAP scans and remains unaffected by noise levels, recorded amplitudes, or motor unit activation thresholds. Moreover, NNEstimation\u2019s estimates on experimental data are highly consistent with those of MScanFit. Significance. Although trained solely on synthetic CMAP scans, NNEstimation achieves estimation results comparable to those of the traditional algorithm on experimental data while significantly reducing execution time, demonstrating its potential for practical MUNE applications.",

    "content": "Objective. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which present significant challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Despite advances in seizure detection, existing methods often struggle with accurately capturing the complex and dynamic interactions between temporal, spatial, and spectral features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This leads to limitations in the detection accuracy and generalization across different datasets. Approach. To address these challenges, we propose global-local weighted attention (GLWA) model, which integrates temporal, spatial, and spectral features through a local-global attention mechanism. At the same time, GLWA effectively balances both global and local features, capturing comprehensive information from EEG signals to enhance seizure detection accuracy. Main results. Our proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 98.82% and 98.89% on the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the model\u2019s capability to effectively integrate these features, resulting in improved detection performance. Significance. Furthermore, we visualize the model\u2019s decision-making process to gain insights into the attention distribution across different brain regions and spectraluency bands, further emphasizing GLWA\u2019s potential in seizure detection. This work demonstrates the model\u2019s superior performance and interpretability, providing a robust approach for accurate and generalizable identification of seizures.",

Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134.

The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "content": "Layer 1 of the cortex is a critical site for integrating top-down inputs onto the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, where inhibitory neurons modulate these inputs to enable context-dependent sensory processing. Yet, it remains unclear how behavioral context dynamically regulates inhibition in Layer 1. We discover a circuit motif in which NDNF cortical interneurons (cINs) presynaptically inhibit the axonal outputs of somatostatin (SST) cINs in Layer 1 of the visual cortex. Using combinatorial genetics, monosynaptic retrograde tracing, super-resolution imaging, optogenetics, slice electrophysiology, and in vivo calcium imaging, we show that NDNF cINs form direct contacts onto SST axons and suppress their output, thereby modulating inhibitory responses in L2/3 pyramidal neurons. This presynaptic inhibitory circuit is preferentially engaged during locomotion and low-contrast visual conditions. By dynamically modulating Layer 1-mediated inhibitory output onto pyramidal neurons, this circuit motif enables context-dependent modulation of visual processing.",

    "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
    "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

    "content": "<p>Much research has focused on how perceptual, cognitive, and attentional processes modulate microsaccades, the small rapid gaze shifts that humans perform when attempting to maintain steady gaze on a point. Yet the reasons why these fixational saccades occur in the first place have remained unclear. Long-standing theories have argued for either spatial (i.e., gaze centering) or temporal mechanisms (i.e., a periodical release process). However, this debate has never been resolved, primarily because of uncertainty in determining where the observer looks. Whereas modern eye-trackers enable detection of small eye movements, accurate localization of the line of sight remains challenging. Here, rather than indirectly inferring gaze position from oculomotor activity, we used a gaze-contingent procedure to directly estimate the perceived center of the visual field, a method that has been previously shown to effectively reduce uncertainty. Our results from subjects of both sexes show that the generation of fixational saccades depends on the interaction of spatial and temporal factors. Fixational saccades are remarkably accurate in correcting for fixation errors, even when gaze is minimally displaced. However, fixational saccades also occur when gaze is centered, but their latency increases as the fixation error decreases. These results suggest that fixational saccades serve an important corrective function when needed, but they can only be avoided for a limited period of time when fixation is already accurate.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The human brain must add information to the acoustic speech signal in order to understand language. Many accounts propose that the prosodic structure of utterances (including their syllabic rhythm and speech melody), in combination with stored lexical knowledge, cue and interact with higher order abstract semantic and syntactic information. While cortical rhythms, particularly in the delta and theta band, synchronize to quasi-rhythmic low-level acoustic speech features, it remains unclear how the human brain encodes abstract speech properties in neural rhythms in the absence of an acoustic signal, i.e., when speakers hold planned sentences in working memory. This study disentangles the contributions of prosodic and syntactic features in cortical rhythms during delayed sentence repetition. Using high-resolution ECoG during awake tumor surgery in the left perisylvian cortex in nine patients (five female), we show that the phase of neural rhythms with frequencies ranging from 1 to 48&nbsp;Hz and the broadband gamma power envelope code both low-level acoustic and abstract syntactic speech features during sentence processing and retention. Syntax and prosody coding occurred in the same frequency bands, which argues against the assumption of different frequency channels for processing and representing these speech features. Our data suggest the brain leverages the phase of various neural rhythms to code both acoustic and abstract linguistic features.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Attention can be deployed in advance of visual stimuli based on features such as color or direction of motion. This anticipatory feature-based attention involves top-down neural control signals from the frontoparietal network that bias visual cortex to enhance attended information and suppress distraction. For example, anticipatory attention control can enable effective selection based on stimulus color while ignoring distracting information about stimulus motion. Anticipatory attention can also be focused more narrowly, for example, to select specific colors or motion directions that define task-relevant aspects of the stimuli. One important question that remains open is whether anticipatory attention control first biases broad feature dimensions such as color versus motion before biasing the specific feature attributes (e.g., blue vs green). To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity during a task where human participants of either sex were cued to either attend to a motion direction (up or down) or a color (blue or green) on a trial-by-trial basis. Applying multivariate decoding approaches to the EEG alpha band activity (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) during attention control (cue-target interval), we observed significant decoding for both the attended dimensions (motion vs color) and specific feature attributes (up vs down; blue vs green). Importantly, the temporal onset of the dimension-level biasing (motion vs color) preceded that of the attribute-level biasing (up vs down and blue vs green). These findings demonstrate that the top-down control of feature-based attention proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first biasing the broad feature dimension, and then narrowing to the specific feature attribute.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Aggressive behavior can be acquired through observation, providing adaptive advantages but also posing significant social risks. In humans, individuals repeatedly exposed to aggression are more likely to engage in violent behavior later in life. Yet, the environmental factors and neural mechanisms underlying observationally acquired aggression remain unclear. Here, we propose that social familiarity with an aggressor is critical for activating neural circuits in observers that primes aggression. To investigate this, we established a novel behavioral paradigm termed \"socially transmitted aggression (STA),\" in which witness mice observed either familiar or unfamiliar demonstrators attacking intruder mice. Remarkably, male, but not female, witnesses displayed increased aggression only after observing familiar demonstrators, with no effect from unfamiliar ones. Given that excitatory neurons in the posterior&ndash;ventral segment of the medial amygdala (MeApv) have been implicated in aggression priming, we hypothesized these neurons might be involved in STA as well. Supporting this hypothesis, fiber photometry revealed selective activation of excitatory MeApv neurons during familiar, but not unfamiliar, demonstrator attacks. Chemogenetically and optogenetically inhibiting these neurons suppressed STA, while activating them during unfamiliar demonstrator attacks promoted aggression. These results establish social familiarity as essential for the observational transmission of aggression and identify excitatory MeApv neurons as critical mediators of this phenomenon, offering potential avenues for clinical intervention.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Perisynaptic astroglia provide critical molecular and structural support to regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in the nanodomain of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM) was used to investigate relationships between perisynaptic astroglia and dendritic spine synapses undergoing plasticity in the adult hippocampus. Delta-burst stimulation (DBS) of the medial perforant pathway induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the middle molecular layer and concurrent long-term depression (cLTD) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in awake male rats. The contralateral hippocampus received baseline stimulation as a within-animal control. Brains were obtained 30&nbsp;min or 2&nbsp;h after DBS onset. An automated 3DEM pipeline was developed to enable unbiased quantification of astroglial coverage at the perimeter of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Under all conditions, &gt;85% of synapses had perisynaptic astroglia processes within 120&nbsp;nm of some portion of the perimeter. LTP broadened the distribution of spine sizes while reducing the presence and proximity of perisynaptic astroglia near the axon&ndash;spine interface of large spines. In contrast, cLTD transiently reduced the length of the axon&ndash;spine interface perimeter without substantially altering astroglial apposition. The postsynaptic density was discovered to be displaced from the center of the axon&ndash;spine interface, with this offset increasing during LTP and decreasing during cLTD. Astroglial access to the postsynaptic density was diminished during LTP and enhanced during cLTD, in parallel with changes in spine size. Thus, access of perisynaptic astroglia to synapses is dynamically modulated during LTP and cLTD alongside synaptic remodeling.</p>",

    "title": "Strengthening Medial Olivocochlear Feedback Reduces the Developmental Impact of Early Noise Exposure",
    "content": "<p>The early onset of peripheral deafness significantly alters the proper development of the auditory system. Likewise, exposure to loud noise during early development produces a similar disruptive effect. Before hearing onset in altricial mammals, cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that drives auditory circuit development. This activity is modulated by medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent feedback through &alpha;9&alpha;10 nicotinic cholinergic receptors in IHCs. In adults, these receptors are restricted to outer hair cells, where they mediate MOC feedback to regulate cochlear amplification. Although the MOC system's protective role to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in adulthood is well established, its influence during early developmental stages&mdash;especially in response to exposure to loud noise&mdash;remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of MOC feedback during early postnatal development using &alpha;9 knock-out (KO) and &alpha;9 knock-in (KI) mice of either sex, which respectively lack or exhibit enhanced cholinergic activity. Our findings reveal that both increased and absent olivocochlear activity result in altered auditory sensitivity at the onset of hearing, along with long-range alterations in the number and morphology of ribbon synapses. Early noise exposure caused lasting auditory damage in both wild-type and &alpha;9KO mice, with deficits persisting into adulthood. In contrast, &alpha;9KI mice were protected from noise-induced damage, with no long-term effects on auditory function. These results highlight the increased susceptibility of the auditory system during early postnatal development. Moreover, they indicate that an enhanced MOC feedback shields the auditory system from noise damage during this period.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) face an increased risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and stroke. While white matter (WM) lesions are frequently reported in patients with CAD, the effects on WM microstructure alterations remain largely unknown. We aimed to identify WM microstructural alterations in individuals with CAD compared with healthy controls (HC) and to examine their relationships with cognitive performance. Forty-three (43) patients with CAD (35 males and 8 females) and 36 HC (26 males and 10 females) aged 50 and older underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and multimodal 3&nbsp;T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A novel multivariate approach&mdash;the Mahalanobis distance (D2)&mdash;was used to quantify WM abnormalities as the amount of deviation from the HC reference group. D2 integrates multiple MRI-derived diffusion-weighted imaging, R1 relaxometry, and magnetization transfer imaging metrics, while accounting for covariance between metrics. Relationships between WM D2 and cognition (executive function and processing speed) were also assessed. Compared with HCs, patients with CAD had higher D2 values in the whole WM (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and in the right anterior and bilateral middle cerebral artery territories (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Myelin-sensitive metrics, particularly R1 relaxation rate and MT saturation, were the most important contributors to D2. Processing speed was positively associated with greater R1 in both the whole WM and left middle cerebral artery territory. These findings suggest that greater WM microstructural alterations observed in patients with CAD were mainly driven by differences in myelin content. These alterations may contribute to a heightened risk of cognitive impairment.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Changes in emotion recognition are observed in aging, in dementia, after brain lesions and as a function of mental health factors, such as depression. In aging, older adults have been argued to show a \"positivity bias,\" which has been associated with a relatively spared recognition accuracy for positive emotion and an increased tendency to label emotions as positive. This bias has been suggested to support mental well-being. However, it has also been found in association with cognitive decline and brain lesions. Here, we investigated the behavioral and brain correlates of this age-related positivity bias. We used multimodal brain imaging in a large group of human adults (<i>n</i> = 665, 333 females) drawn from a population-derived cohort across the lifespan, together with a psychometric analysis of an emotion recognition task using facial expressions. Beyond reductions in expression recognition accuracy, older adults showed increased perceptual thresholds for negative emotions and a reduced threshold for the positive emotion, even after accounting for general face recognition abilities. This positivity bias in labeling emotions was strongly associated with lower cognitive performance in older people, but not with (nonclinical) depressive symptoms. It was also associated with reduced gray matter volume in the bilateral anterior hippocampus&ndash;amygdala and increased functional connectivity between these regions and the orbitofrontal cortex. Together, age-related positivity bias is associated with cognitive decline and structural and functional brain differences. A positivity bias in emotion recognition may therefore reflect an early marker of neurodegeneration, a hypothesis that could be tested in future longitudinal studies.</p>",

Despite a wealth of studies tracking visual verification among external contents of perception, complementary verification processes among internal contents of memory remain elusive. Building on a recently established gaze marker of internal visual focusing in working memory, we uncover the internal inspection process associated with confirming or dismissing potential search targets. We show how male and female human participants \"look back\" into working memory when faced with external stimuli that are perceived as potential targets and link such internal inspection to the time needed for visual verification. A direct comparison between visual verification among the contents of working memory or perception further revealed how verification in both domains engages frontal theta activity in scalp electroencephalography but also how mnemonic verification is slower to deploy than perceptual verification. This establishes internal verification as an integral component of visual search and provides new ways to look into this underexplored component of human search behavior.</p>",

    "title": "Accelerated brain age in Moyamoya disease patients: a deep learning approach and correlation with disease severity",
    "content": "IntroductionThis study aims to utilize a DenseNet based deep learning framework to predict brain age in patients with Moyamoya disease (MMD), examining the relationship between brain age and disease severity to enhance diagnostic and prognostic capabilities.MethodsWe analyzed unenhanced MRI scans from 432 adult MMD patients and 565 normal controls collected between January 2018 and December 2022. Data preprocessing involved converting DICOM files to NIFTI format and labeling based on established diagnostic criteria. A DenseNet121 architecture, implemented using PyTorch, was employed to predict brain age. Statistical analyses included correlation assessments and comparisons between predicted brain age, chronological age, and MRA scores.ResultsThe predicted brain age for MMD patients was significantly higher than their chronological age, averaging 37.9 years versus 35.8 years (p < 0.01). For normal controls, predicted brain age matched chronological age at 36.5 years. Delta age (difference between predicted brain age and chronological age) was significantly elevated in MMD patients (p < 0.001) and positively correlated with MRA scores, indicating a link between arterial stenosis severity and accelerated brain aging.DiscussionThe DenseNet based model effectively predicts brain age, revealing that MMD patients experience accelerated brain aging correlated with disease severity. These findings highlight the potential of brain age prediction as a biomarker for MMD, aiding in personalized treatment strategies and early intervention. Future research should explore multi-center datasets and longitudinal data to validate and extend these findings.",

    "content": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a leading neurodegenerative disorder, presents significant global health challenges. Advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising tools for analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data to improve AD diagnosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of GNN applications in AD diagnosis, focusing on data sources, modalities, sample sizes, classification tasks, and diagnostic performance. Drawing on extensive literature searches across PubMed, IEEE Xplorer, Scopus, and Springer, we analyze key GNN frameworks and critically evaluate their limitations, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. In addition, we present a comparative analysis to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of GNN methods across different datasets, such as ADNI, OASIS, TADPOLE, UK Biobank, in-house, etc. Furthermore, we provide a critical methodological comparison across families of GNN architectures (i.e., GCN, ChebNet, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN, etc.) in the context of AD. Finally, we outline future research directions to refine GNN-based diagnostic methods and highlight their potential role in advancing AI-driven neuroimaging solutions. Our findings aim to foster the integration of AI technologies in neurodegenerative disease research and clinical practice.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe thalamus, along with its component nuclei, possesses extensive connections with various brain regions and is engaged in diverse functions. However, it is unknown whether the gray matter volume (GMV) covariance networks of thalamic subfields are selectively affected in chronic capsular stroke.MethodsWe recruited 45 patients with chronic right capsular strokes (CS) and 93 normal controls (NC) from three centers. The thalamus was segmented into 25 subfields using FreeSurfer (v7.1.1). A general linear model was applied to investigate intergroup differences in the GMV covariance network of each thalamic subfield with each voxel of the entire brain between CS and NC, correcting for confounders such as age, gender, total intracranial volume (TIV), and scanners (voxel-wise p\u202f<\u202f0.001, cluster-wise FWE corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ResultsOur findings revealed that all 25 ipsilesional thalamic subfields in CS were atrophied (p\u202f<\u202f0.05, FDR correction). Among these, 16 ipsilesional thalamic subfields (including AV, LD, LP, VLa, VLp, VPL, VM, CeM, CL, MDm, LGN, PuM, PuI, CM, Pf, and Pt) exhibited significantly subfield-specific increased GMV covariance connectivity with the anterior orbital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, calcarine, anterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus, and other regions. Additionally, although none of the contralesional thalamic subfields demonstrated regional GMV changes, 3/25 showed subfield-specific increased GMV covariance connectivity with the ipsilesional anterior orbital gyrus and subcortex.ConclusionThe GMV covariance networks of thalamic subfields are selectively involved in patients with chronic capsular stroke, which affect not only the ipsilesional thalamic subfields but also the contralesional ones.",

    "title": "Efficient spiking convolutional neural networks accelerator with multi-structure compatibility",
    "content": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) possess excellent computational energy efficiency and biological credibility. Among them, Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs) have significantly improved performance, demonstrating promising applications in low-power and brain-like computing. To achieve hardware acceleration for SCNNs, we propose an efficient FPGA accelerator architecture with multi-structure compatibility. This architecture supports both traditional convolutional and residual topologies, and can be adapted to diverse requirements from small networks to complex networks. This architecture uses a clock-driven scheme to perform convolution and neuron updates based on the spike-encoded image at each timestep. Through hierarchical pipelining and channel parallelization strategies, the computation speed of SCNNs is increased. To address the issue of current accelerators only supporting simple network, this architecture combines configuration and scheduling methods, including grouped reuse computation and line-by-line multi-timestep computation to accelerate deep networks with lots of channels and large feature map sizes. Based on the proposed accelerator architecture, we evaluated two scales of networks, named small-scale LeNet and deep residual SCNN, for object detection. Experiments show that the proposed accelerator achieves a maximum recognition speed of 1, 605 frames/s at a 100 MHz clock for the LeNet network, consuming only 0.65 mJ per image. Furthermore, the accelerator, combined with the proposed configuration and scheduling methods, achieves acceleration for each residual module in the deep residual SCNN, reaching a processing speed of 2.59 times that of the CPU with a power consumption of only 16.77% of the CPU. This demonstrates that the proposed accelerator architecture can achieve higher energy efficiency, compatibility, and wider applicability.",

    "title": "Personalized temporal interference stimulation targeting striatum reduces functional stability and dynamic connectivity variability in the sensorimotor network",
    "content": "BackgroundFunctional stability within brain networks, particularly the sensorimotor network (SMN), is crucial for coherent motor control. Temporal Interference (TI) stimulation offers a non-invasive method to modulate deep brain structures like the striatum, yet its impact on dynamic functional stability across motor networks remains largely unexplored.MethodsTwenty-six healthy male participants separately underwent TI stimulation and Sham stimulation in a crossover, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with counterbalanced protocol. resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was acquired before and during the stimulation. A total of 20 min TI stimulation (10 mA, \u0394f = 20 Hz) was applied to the right striatum using personalized electrode montages optimized. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) was computed using a sliding-window approach. Voxel-wise functional stability across the whole brain was quantified by Kendall\u2019s concordance coefficient of voxel-to-voxel dFC. Seed-based dFC variability in the right striatum was measured as the standard deviation of dFC across windows.Results(1) Functional stability: TI stimulation significantly decreased functional stability in bilateral SMA regions (predominantly SMA proper, with parts of pre-SMA) compared to Sham and baseline conditions (P < 0.01). (2) Dynamic functional connectivity: TI stimulation reduced dFC variability between the right striatum and left SMA region (predominantly SMA proper, with parts of pre-SMA) compared to baseline (P < 0.01). (3) Safety: No adverse cognitive effects or side effects were observed, with good blinding effectiveness maintained throughout the study.ConclusionOur findings indicate that TI stimulation targeting the striatum effectively modulates sensorimotor network stability and dFC variability within the cortico-striatal pathway, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach for motor network disorders.Clinical trial registration[www.chictr.org.cn;], identifier [ChiCTR2500098699].",

    "title": "From zero- to few-shot: deep temporal learning of wrist EMG enables scalable cross-user gesture recognition",
    "content": "Objective. Wrist electromyography (EMG) is emerging as an enticing wearable input modality for human\u2013machine interaction. Traditionally recorded from the forearm for use in transradial prostheses, wrist-based EMG sensors are now being integrated into devices such as watches and wristbands for hand gesture recognition (HGR). Consumer familiarity with wrist-worn devices makes wrist EMG a compelling option, but the need for individualized user calibration remains a challenge. Approach. This study therefore evaluated various cross-user models to reduce the calibration burden and compared wrist- and forearm-based models. Eight different machine learning architectures were evaluated across 33 users, using varying amounts of data from the end user. Main results. A temporal convolutional network-bidirectional long short-term memory architecture, applied for the first time to EMG classification, was found to significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) outperform other tested machine learning architectures. An inter-day feature set combined with Z-score normalization achieved the best performance when classifying five gestures (plus a rest class) using either wrist or forearm EMG. Consistent with other recent results, wrist EMG consistently outperformed forearm EMG in all analyses, including within- and across-user comparisons (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In cross-user models, wrist EMG demonstrated a zero-shot performance of 78.2%, compared to 71.6% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Introducing one calibration repetition from the end user increased one-shot performance of wrist EMG to 91.6%, compared to 86.9% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Adding further training repetitions boosted wrist EMG performance to 98.3%, compared to 97.4% for forearm EMG. Significance. These findings provide new evidence supporting the viability of wrist EMG for cross-user HGR models that generalize to new users with minimal calibration, suggesting promising potential for its broader adoption in wearable devices.",

    "content": "Objective: There is a need for effective cognitive assessment tools to evaluate the development of very young children in resource-limited low- and middle-income country settings. Our objective was to evaluate the field usability of a computer-based attention test and its concurrent validity with a caregiver-reported screener of neurodevelopment in rural, Ecuadorian children. Method: To assess a computer-based attention test in a resource-limited setting, 41 Ecuadorian children between 2 and 4 years of age were evaluated once with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention adapted to eye-tracking instrumentation. To evaluate the validity of the ECVT, results were compared with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133, measured 3\u20134 times between 21 and 48 months of age. Results: ECVT measures were collected successfully for 97.6% of children (40/41), suggesting good field usability of the test in this resource-limited setting. An increase in 1 SD in child attention, as measured by the ECVT average fixation duration, was associated with a 7.9-point increase in the overall Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133 score (95% CI [1.5, 14.2], <em>p</em> = .015). Conclusions: A computer-based attention assessment in early childhood was usable in a resource-limited setting and predictive of a caregiver-reported screener of child neurodevelopment. The ECVT, therefore, can be used to assess the effects of early risk factors and resilience in brain/behavior development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index \u201cspeed\u201d potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. Method: The present study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children aged 8\u201312 with and without ADHD (<em>N</em> = 119). Results: There was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the <em>tau</em> parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD and among children with low working memory capacity (regardless of ADHD status). Variance in <em>tau</em> was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of adopting analytic methods that can more accurately describe performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here, we determine whether familiarizing individuals with self-appraisal with daily memory testing for 7 days provide a more accurate estimate of cognitive functioning and mood. Method: Two hundred twenty-five participants (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> \u00b1 <em>SD</em>: 74.1 \u00b1 8.3 years; 66% female; median education 16.0 years) completed the online Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health, which included two associative memory tasks, for seven consecutive days. Each day, participants self-appraised their performance. At baseline, they completed various cognitive and mood measures. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between task performance and self-appraisal on Days 1 and 7 and used linear models to examine the relationship between self-appraisal scores and clinical measures. Results: Accuracy (Day 1: 0.44 \u00b1 0.12; Day 7: 0.81 \u00b1 0.16) and self-appraisal (Day 1: 0.36 \u00b1 0.15; Day 7: 0.70 \u00b1 0.21) increased, as did the association between accuracy and self-appraisal, Day 1: correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [0.09, 0.34], <em>p</em> = .001; Day 7: <em>r</em> = 0.69, 95% CI [0.62, 0.76], <em>p</em> < .001. Self-appraisal scores on Day 7, but not Day 1, showed significant relationships with in-clinic measures. Conclusions: Repeated remote cognitive assessments may help elucidate individuals\u2019 capacities to refine their self-perception of cognitive performance during multiday learning. The weak association between accuracy and test-na\u00efve self-appraisal warrants caution about using this metric cross-sectionally. Experienced self-appraisal could be especially relevant at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when subtle learning difficulties emerge and could improve our capacity to detect early meta-cognitive changes.

    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychological norms serve to identify cognitive impairment and monitor neurodegenerative disease progression. However, longitudinal data are limited, and conventional approaches do not account for biomarkers to exclude underlying Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, reducing sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive decline in preclinical AD. To address these limitations, this research provides robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms derived from Spanish individuals with nonpathological levels of AD biomarkers. Method: We analyzed 3-year follow-up data from 350 cognitively unimpaired individuals (Alzheimer\u2019s and Families+ cohort). A subset of 228 individuals with normal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242/40, phosphorylated-tau181, and total-tau biomarkers defined the robust reference group. Neuropsychological assessment encompassed the Trail Making Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Memory Binding Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013IV, Wechsler Memory Scale\u2013IV, Semantic Fluency Test, and Judgment of Line Orientation from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Using the Reliable Change Index and Standardized Regression-Based methods, robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms were derived from the reference group. Validation analysis assessed the sensitivity of robust versus conventional normative procedures. Results: Models, equations, percentiles, and cutoffs for identifying significant cognitive decline were provided. Robust norms showed modestly greater sensitivity in certain measures, particularly in episodic memory. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: Total Free Delayed Recall showed the most notable result at the 5th percentile in Reliable Change Index (\u03c7\u00b2 = 16.06, <em>p</em> = 6.15E-05). Conclusions: Robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms may improve the detection of subtle cognitive decline, modestly enhancing sensitivity at the lower ends of distributions.

    "title": "Posttraumatic stress symptomatology rather than mild traumatic brain injury is related to atypical early neural processing during cognitive control.",
    "content": "Objective: Many veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) report disruptions in cognition; however, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these cognitive difficulties are not well understood. It is also unknown whether PTSD symptomatology or past mTBIs uniquely impact functions important to adaptation such as cognitive control. Method: We examined event-related potentials elicited by a flanker task to evaluate brain responses during conflict monitoring in a sample of 192 U.S. military veterans with combat-zone experience and exposure to explosive blasts. Clinical assessments characterized diagnoses as well as the severity of PTSD symptoms and mTBI so that we could parse overlapping syndromes and directly contrast effects of the two conditions. Results: Across groups, participants performed worse on conflict trials (Incongruent distractors), particularly when preceded by a no-conflict (Congruent distractors) trial. We found that greater dysphoric PTSD symptomatology was related to a reduced early perceptual response (P1), while greater avoidance PTSD symptomatology predicted a larger early visual attention response (N1). Although late cognitive processes (N2, P3) were sensitive to cognitive control demands of the flanker task, posttraumatic symptomatology and mTBI severity were unrelated to them. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the Avoidance and Dysphoria domains of PTSD symptomatology may differentially relate to early neural functions of perception and visual attention rather than later cognitive responses. Rehabilitation and treatment of individuals with PTSD and mTBI may be most productive when focused on perceptual and attentional processing, which could improve cognitive control.

    "content": "Cortical feedback from higher frontal and association areas to early sensory cortex is thought to contribute to a range of cognitive processes in which sensory signals are processed in a context sensitive manner. Despite the ubiquity of feedback circuitry in the cortex, the information carried by feedback connections, and the principles governing how it is targeted from area to area remains poorly understood. Here we characterized the functional properties of a prominent feedback circuit which links retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and primary visual cortex (V1). We found that RSC>V1 axons relay retinotopically selective signals to V1 which at a coarse scale match the region of the V1 retinotopic map innervated, were tuned for spatial and temporal frequency, but not tuned for orientation. Two-color imaging of RSC>V1 boutons and local L2/3 V1 neurons further revealed that at a finer scale RSC>V1 bouton receptive fields are systematically offset relative to those of V1 in the nasal direction, consistent with RSC>V1 boutons conveying signals predictive of upcoming V1 activity in the retinotopic region innervated during forward movement.",

    "title": "Effects of asymmetrical postural demands on sternocleidomastoid reflex in the startReact paradigm",
    "content": "IntroductionstartReact, the rapid release of a planned movement following a startling acoustic stimulus (usually >100 dB), is widely used to assess reticulospinal tract (RST) involvement in motor control. The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) reflex within 120 ms often identifies true startle responses, i.e., responses facilitated by RSTs in the absence of cortical control. However, as the SCM is a postural muscle, its reflexive activation may be influenced by inhibitory anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), particularly during tasks with greater head/neck postural demands.MethodsWe compared SCM activation during unilateral shoulder abduction (SABD) versus hand opening (OPEN) tasks. Due to the increased asymmetrical head/neck postural demands in SABD, we hypothesized an APA-induced delay in SCM activation during SABD compared to the OPEN task, with a contralateral bias due to contralateral cortical circuits triggering APAs.ResultsOur results revealed significantly longer SCM latency\u2014exceeding the 120 ms cutoff\u2014during SABD relative to OPEN. This suggested that APAs during postural tasks, resulting from unilateral SABD, altered the expression of the startReact response. To confirm this finding, we implemented an innovative, data-driven method to determine the appropriate SCM cutoff based on the physiological difference between startle-induced SCM reflexes and task-induced SCM activation. Using this method, we observed reduced contralateral SCM reflexive activation compared to ipsilateral, during SABD but not in OPEN.DiscussionThis provides evidence for the first time that SCM reflexive activation in startReact is posture-dependent. Our novel classification method offers a robust framework for identifying true startle responses across different tasks, offering broader applicability for studies investigating RST involvement in motor control.",

    "title": "When embodiment matters most: a confirmatory study on VR priming in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces training",
    "content": "BackgroundVirtual Reality (VR) feedback is increasingly integrated into Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, enhancing the Sense of Embodiment (SoE) toward virtual avatars and fostering more vivid motor imagery (MI). VR-based MI-BCIs hold promise for motor rehabilitation, but their effectiveness depends on neurofeedback quality. Although SoE may enhance MI training, its role as a priming strategy prior to VR-BCI has not been systematically examined, as prior work assessed embodiment only after interaction. This study investigates whether embodiment priming influences MI-BCI outcomes, focusing on event-related desynchronization (ERD) and BCI performance.MethodsUsing a within-subject design, we combined data from a pilot study with an extended experiment, yielding 39 participants. Each completed an embodiment induction phase followed by MI training with EEG recordings. ERD and lateralization indices were analyzed across conditions to test the effect of prior embodiment.ResultsEmbodiment induction reliably increased SoE, yet no significant ERD differences were found between embodied and control conditions. However, lateralization indices showed greater variability in the embodied condition, suggesting individual differences in integrating embodied feedback.ConclusionOverall, findings indicate that real-time VR-based feedback during training, rather than prior embodiment, is the main driver of MI-BCI performance improvements. These results corroborate earlier findings that real-time rendering of embodied feedback during MI-BCI training constitutes the primary mechanism supporting performance gains, while highlighting the complex role of embodiment in VR-based MI-BCIs.",

    "content": "IntroductionSensorimotor integration is crucial role for goal-directed tasks, with sensorimotor mismatch impairing movement execution and potentially evoking anxiety. However, the relationship between mismatch-induced anxiety, movement precision, and automaticity remains unexplored. This study investigated the effect of sensorimotor mismatch on voluntary postural control during goal-directed tasks and the relationship between sensorimotor mismatch-induced anxiety and motor performance.MethodsTwenty-three young, injury-free adults performed a precision task requiring center of pressure (COP) control within a limited screen area under congruent (aligned visual inputs and motor outputs) and incongruent (180-degree mismatch between visual feedback and motor actions) conditions. Self-reported anxiety was assessed using a seven-point Likert scale. Motor performance was quantified using COP area, total path length and sample entropy of COP trajectory for movement precision and automaticity.ResultsSensorimotor mismatch significantly increased self-reported anxiety (p = 0.02) and reduced movement automaticity, evidenced by lower sample entropy values (p < 0.01). Higher anxiety scores were correlated with decreased movement automaticity in the medio-lateral direction (lower sample entropy) under the mismatch condition (r = \u22120.33, p = 0.008).DiscussionThese findings suggest that sensorimotor mismatch induces self-perceived anxiety and disrupts automatic motor control processes.",

    "title": "Association between neuroticism and physical activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysical activity has been shown to be associated with neuroticism, a personality trait reflecting emotional instability and a tendency toward negative emotions. Understanding this relationship is crucial for developing effective mental health interventions. However, the underlying mechanisms and the strength of this association remain insufficiently understood.ObjectiveThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the current research on the relationship between neuroticism and physical activity, analyze their correlations and moderating factors, and investigate the potential bidirectional mechanisms linking these two factors.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost for studies published between January 2000 and November 2024. We included English-language studies across all age groups that employed cross-sectional, longitudinal, or cohort designs. Studies focusing on special populations, non-peer-reviewed works, samples with fewer than 50 participants, non-empirical studies, and reviews were excluded. Data extraction was performed using standardized forms, and a meta-analysis was conducted in Stata 18 to assess heterogeneity and publication bias.ResultsAfter screening, 25 studies were included, comprising 15 Pearson correlation analyses and 12 multiple regression analyses. The meta-analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between physical activity and neuroticism, with an average correlation coefficient r = \u22120.141. This suggests that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower levels of neuroticism. Specifically, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for neuroticism inhibiting physical activity was \u22120.150, indicating that for every one standard deviation increase in neuroticism, physical activity decreases by approximately 0.150 standard deviation units. Conversely, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for physical activity affecting neuroticism was \u22120.113, suggesting a potential reduction in neuroticism with increased physical activity, although this effect was not statistically significant across the limited number of studies.ConclusionOur findings confirm a significant negative association between physical activity and neuroticism, highlighting the potential of physical activity as a strategy for improving mental health. However, establishing causality requires further verification through longitudinal and experimental designs. The results emphasize the need for personalized interventions targeting individuals with high neuroticism. Future research should prioritize diverse cultural samples, standardized measurement protocols, and mechanistic investigations of this bidirectional relationship to better understand the underlying processes and develop effective interventions.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251051360, identifier: CRD420251051360.",

    "content": "IntroductionWhile lesion and neurophysiological animal studies point toward a notable involvement of subcortical pathways in the control of low back muscles, little attention has been dedicated to the subject in humans. The StartReact paradigm may allow to indirectly test the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system during motor control, thus addressing this gap of knowledge. In this study, we aimed to compare the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system in the control of low back muscles during voluntary (lumbar spine extension) and postural (upper limb movement eliciting anticipatory postural adjustment) tasks using the StartReact paradigm.MethodsThe reaction time (RT) of the lumbar erector spinae was measured within a simple precued RT task while conditioned by startling (SAS\u2014116\u202fdB) or non-startling (NSAS\u201480\u202fdB) acoustic stimuli.ResultsThe reduction in RT was similar during the postural and voluntary tasks. However, RT was more shortened with the SAS condition compared to the NSAS condition in both tasks. This finding was replicated using a cumulative distribution functions analysis.DiscussionFor the first time, a StartReact effect of back muscles was demonstrated during a voluntary task and was shown to be similar to that observed in a postural task. Therefore, these results suggest a contribution of the reticulospinal tract in the postural and voluntary control of back muscles in humans.",

    "content": "Motor imagery (MI) engages neural systems that overlap with actual movement and is widely used in sport and rehabilitation. Yet conflicting findings suggest that experts show either reduced (neural efficiency) or increased (vivid simulation) brain activation during MI. We hypothesized that task complexity moderates this effect. Using fNIRS, we compared experts and novices during MI of simple versus complex soccer actions. Experts showed lower activation for simple tasks but higher activation for...",

    "content": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is parasomnia characterized by the loss of physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting behaviors that often manifest as complex, violent motor activity. While RBD may occur idiopathically, it is frequently associated with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly \u03b1-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, secondary RBD linked to acute cerebrovascular events remains poorly documented. Here, we present a novel case of acute pontine infarction precipitating RBD, highlighting the brainstem\u2019s critical role in REM sleep regulation and expanding the spectrum of secondary RBD etiologies. This case report underscores the importance of neuroanatomical localization in evaluating acute-onset RBD, particularly in the context of cerebrovascular pathology.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

    "content": "Early life adversity (ELA) is associated with subsequent mental health problems, and animal studies provide evidence for a causal role of ELA in the risk for mental illness, including persistent brain changes at molecular, cellular, network and functional levels. As enduring changes in cell function depend on orchestrated expression of genes, a robust body of research has focused on identifying the specific epigenetic and transcriptional programs through which ELA might induce brain changes. These studies have highlighted that the effects of ELA vary by brain region, cell-types and sex. Yet, while major advances were made in the past decade, the precise mechanisms through which ELA shapes the maturation and function of brain cells and their incorporation into circuits remain incompletely understood. Here, we discuss human and animal studies that focus on ELA-induced changes of the epigenome and transcriptome and explore recent technological advances that allow visualization and manipulation of neurons activated during ELA, at later stages of life. One such technology, Targeted Recombination in Active Populations (TRAP), enables precise and permanent genetic access to cells activated during specific sensitive developmental periods. Coupled with the appropriate tools, TRAP can be used to identify cellular transcriptional programs that are altered by the ELA experience in specific cell types and circuits, impacting cognitive and emotional brain functions enduringly. Understanding how ELA changes gene expression, circuit integration and function of neurons that are engaged by ELA will advance our understanding of the mechanisms employed by ELA to heighten the risk for mental illness later in life.",

    "title": "Differential susceptibility to prenatal stress exposure in serotonin transporter-deficient female mice\u2014an epigenetic exploration",
    "content": "IntroductionEarly-life stress exposure has been linked to an increased risk for the onset of mental disorders. As another factor, an individual\u2019s genetic make-up may also tip the scale towards health or disease, with certain genetic variants mediating differential susceptibility towards the effects of early-life stress or other experiences. The current study investigated the molecular foundation of individual variation in the response to prenatal stress (PS) exposure in wildtype mice as well as in mice deficient for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) transporter (5-HTT).MethodsTo meet this end, wildtype C57BL6/J dams were mated with 5-Htt+/- C57BL6/J males, after which they were exposed to restraint stress during the last part of gestation. In adulthood, female 5-HTT-deficient PS offspring and their wildtype littermates as well as age-matched control groups completed a behavioural test-battery, after which gene expression and histone 3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) enrichment, as a marker of epigenetic programming, were measured in hippocampal tissue.ResultsDependent on the 5-Htt genotype, PS offspring showed decreased social behaviour in the 3-chamber sociability test. Notably, we observed a considerable degree of behavioural variation in the observed effect of PS in this social test, which allowed segregation into socially affected (SA) and socially unaffected (SU) mice. Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling of hippocampal tissue revealed a core set of 23 genes to be associated with genotype-specific variation in social behaviour following PS exposure. Whereas H3K4me3 levels did not show profound global changes in relation to the variable effects of PS exposure on social behaviour, the kinesin family member 14 (Kif14) gene, which displayed increased expression in socially unaffected wildtype mice, did show lower levels of H3K4me3 in those same mice, but not in any of the other groups.DiscussionAll in all, differential susceptibility linked to PS exposure displayed 5-Htt genotype-dependent behavioural and transcriptomic profiles, supporting the notion of 5-HT-dependent developmental programming.",

We identified the top 100 most-cited articles published in each database from 2005 to 2025, merged and deduplicated the results, and selected the 100 most-cited papers on optic nerve regeneration. After extracting key details such as titles, authors, keywords, publication information, and institutional affiliations, a bibliometric analysis was conducted.ResultsThe top 100 most cited papers on optic nerve regeneration published between 2005 and 2025, accumulating 34,636 total citations with a median of 346 citations per paper. Prof. Zhigang He emerged as the most prolific author with 19 publications. The United States contributed 59 papers, while Harvard University led institutions with 30 publications. Key research themes included optic nerve regeneration, CNTF, gene therapy, and retinal ganglion cells.ConclusionOur analysis of top-cited optic nerve regeneration research reveals sustained United States leadership in output and innovation. Early work focused on neuronal signaling pathways (PTEN/mTOR, KLF family), while current studies explore novel targets and biomaterials. Global collaboration among the United States, China, and European nations has accelerated progress. Key challenges remain in achieving functional long-distance regeneration. Future direction should prioritize the development of multi-target therapeutic methods, precise drug delivery, and the control of inflammation to improve nerve regeneration efficiency.",

    "title": "Acquired crowding dyslexia: A peripheral reading deficit other than neglect dyslexia.",
    "content": "Objectives: Crowding refers to the phenomenon whereby small visual objects above the acuity threshold are detected but unrecognizable when surrounded by nearby stimuli. It affects reading in healthy individuals and can be enhanced in reading impairments. By increasing the interletter space, crowding decreases. Previous evidence on patients with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and peripheral dyslexia has shown a dissociation in sensitivity to spacing manipulation between those who mainly produced omissions and those characterized by substitutions in reading. Here, we wanted to verify the hypothesis that the reading impairment mainly characterized by substitutions is dissociated from USN, unlike the one characterized by omissions. Method: In a retrospective study, we collected 38 right-brain-damaged patients, 21 with USN. We analyzed the number and types of errors in reading single words and pseudowords, spaced and unspaced, comparing patients with and without USN. Results: USN patients showed significantly more omissions than patients without USN and increased omissions with letter spacing. Substitutions were more frequent in USN patients but did not increase with spacing. Performance of patients mainly characterized by substitutions revealed a reduction of errors with spaced pseudowords and a double dissociation from USN. Lesion overlap analysis suggested that the two deficits could depend on different components of visuospatial attention networks. Conclusions: We claim that proper neglect dyslexia is characterized by omission errors and has USN as a necessary mechanism, even if not sufficient. Conversely, acquired crowding dyslexia is a different reading deficit, characterized by substitutions due to an enhanced crowding phenomenon, independent of USN.

    "content": "Objective: Cannabis has become increasingly accessible to populations living with chronic health conditions such as HIV. Many people living with HIV are turning to cannabis for symptom relief despite the unclear risks to neurocognitive health. Our study sought to replicate and extend prior research by examining global and domain-specific neurocognitive performance between four groups stratified by use of cannabis (CB; CB+/CB\u2212) and HIV serostatus (HIV+/HIV\u2212). Method: Our demographically diverse community sample (<em>N</em> = 269) underwent exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the effects of cannabis use (CU) and HIV on neurocognition. We explored between-group comparisons of neurocognitive performance, probability of neurocognitive impairment, and interactive effects of CU/HIV serostatus. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed nonsignificant differences in global or domain-specific neurocognitive performance. However, the CB+/HIV+ group was three times (99% CI [1.18, 9.57]) more likely to be labeled with a memory impairment compared to the control (CB-/HIV\u2212), and the CB+/HIV\u2212 group was twice (99% CI [.14, 7.47]) as likely to be labeled with an executive functioning impairment compared to the control. We also identified an interactive effect between the past 30-day CU and HIV serostatus for global (<em>b</em> = \u2212.026, 99% CI [\u2212.04, \u2212.01]) and motor (<em>b</em> = \u2212.052, 99% CI [\u2212.07, \u2212.03]) neurocognitive performance. Findings support a nuanced relationship between CU and HIV, which may partly explain mixed literature. Conclusions: Although we conclude that recent and heavy CU poses risk of neurocognitive decline among people living with HIVs, this effect is modest. Physicians and patients must weigh a possible decrease in global and motor neurocognition against the severity of symptoms being treated.

    "content": "There are dream metaphors that express waking-life experiences indirectly. Animals in dreams have been speculated to be related to dream metaphors. Here, we explored if there was any relationship between waking-life experiences related to elder relatives with both dreaming about elder relatives and dreaming about animals. For 1 day, 270 participants recorded waking-life experiences in daily diaries before sleeping and recorded their dreams upon waking. Two external judges rated if there was any content related to elder relatives or animals in both daily diaries and dreams. The most three frequent animals in dreams were dogs, cats, and snakes, or fishes, or birds. The frequency of waking-life experiences related to elder relatives was correlated with both the frequency of dreaming about elder relatives and the frequency of dreaming about animals. Yet, the latter two variables were not correlated with each other. The results supported the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. In addition, the results may suggest that some animals in dreams represented elder relatives in waking life metaphorically. Moreover, the results may support Carl Jung\u2019s idea that the image of animals in dreams may be a symbol of parents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Whose sexual dream experiences are more intense? An exploratory study on the relationship between personality traits and sexual dreams.",
    "content": "Sexual dreams reflect individuals\u2019 attitudes toward sex, the personal significance of sex, and/or sexual issues in their waking life. Gaining insight into the factors associated with the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences is beneficial for achieving a comprehensive assessment of sexual mental health. The study will explore the relationship among personality traits, anxiety, depression, and sexual dream experiences based on the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. A questionnaire was administered to 384 participants (mean age = 20.63 years, SD = 1.21; 205 females, 179 males), revealing that over half of them reported having sexual dreams, with a higher prevalence among males. The sexual dream group scored higher than the nonsexual dream group on aggressiveness, neuroticism, and sensation seeking. Furthermore, negative emotions, sensation seeking, activity, and extraversion play an important role in the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences among sexual dreamers. These findings provide valuable insights for sexual education practitioners to understand individuals\u2019 sexual dream experiences and related psychological factors, contributing to scientific advancements in sexual health and education.

    "content": "In separate literature\u2014end-of-life experiences, dreams in bereavement, and continuing bonds in bereavement\u2014there are preliminary findings that both dreaming of the deceased and having an experiential encounter while awake are common experiences. The present, brief report is a post hoc analysis of previously unanalyzed items from two studies of bereaved individuals. One study focused on loss following the death of a romantic partner (n = 268) and the other following the death of a dog or cat (n = 199). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had dreamed of the deceased or had a waking experience of seeing, hearing, or feeling the touch of the deceased in the prior month. Consistent with prior research, a substantial portion of each sample (50.7% of the partner loss participants and 32.2% of the pet loss) reported at least one waking experience of seeing, hearing, and/or feeling the deceased. When dreaming of the deceased and/or having a waking experience of the deceased were combined, it was found to be 82.5% for partner loss and 68.2% for pet loss. Furthermore, dreaming about the deceased was related to having such waking experiences. These preliminary, exploratory findings contribute to the growing recognition that we need more research and theory into the function of such experiences for the bereaved and for those facing end of life.

    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

Using a sample of 112 Chinese young adult (74 females, 38 males, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.83) residents in Hong Kong, this article reports an investigation into relationships between trauma (as manifested in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), dream content (dream motifs, classified according to persecution or ego ideal delusional inclinations), and nightmare distress, all recalled by participants in relation to personal experiences of the Anti-ELAB. The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay.

    "content": "arXiv:2509.20369v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper presents VITA (Virtual Teaching Assistants), an adaptive distributed learning (ADL) platform that embeds a large language model (LLM)-powered chatbot (BotCaptain) to provide dialogic support, interoperable analytics, and integrity-aware assessment for workforce preparation in data science. The platform couples context-aware conversational tutoring with formative-assessment patterns designed to promote reflective reasoning. The paper describes an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms chat logs into Experience API (xAPI) statements, instructor dashboards that surface outliers for just-in-time intervention, and an adaptive pathway engine that routes learners among progression, reinforcement, and remediation content. The paper also benchmarks VITA conceptually against emerging tutoring architectures, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--based assistants and Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)--integrated hubs, highlighting trade-offs among content grounding, interoperability, and deployment complexity. Contributions include a reusable architecture for interoperable conversational analytics, a catalog of patterns for integrity-preserving formative assessment, and a practical blueprint for integrating adaptive pathways into data-science courses. The paper concludes with implementation lessons and a roadmap (RAG integration, hallucination mitigation, and LTI~1.3 / OpenID Connect) to guide multi-course evaluations and broader adoption. In light of growing demand and scalability constraints in traditional instruction, the approach illustrates how conversational AI can support engagement, timely feedback, and personalized learning at scale. Future work will refine the platform's adaptive intelligence and examine applicability across varied educational settings.",

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over 16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent. Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness 86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%; 14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI 62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians. Limitations include small per-item samples and early-adopter bias; future work will include accuracy audits and prospective studies on workflow and care quality.",

When applying feature attributions to explain language models, a basic question is defining the interpretable components. Traditional feature attribution methods, commonly treat individual words as atomic units. This is highly computationally inefficient for long-form text and fails to capture semantic information that spans multiple words. To address this, we present CafGa, an interactive tool for generating and evaluating feature attribution explanations at customizable granularities. CafGa supports customized segmentation with user interaction and visualizes the deletion and insertion curves for explanation assessments. Through a user study involving participants of various expertise, we confirm CafGa's usefulness, particularly among LLM practitioners. Explanations created using CafGa were also perceived as more useful compared to those generated by two fully automatic baseline methods: PartitionSHAP and MExGen, suggesting the effectiveness of the system.",

However, its practicality is often undermined by the vulnerability to spoofing attacks and interference from surrounding sounds, making seamless voice authentication crucial for smart glasses usage. To address this challenge, we propose AuthGlass, a voice authentication approach that leverages both air- and bone-conducted speech features to enhance accuracy and liveness detection. Aiming to gain comprehensive knowledge on speech-related acoustic and vibration features, we built a smart glasses prototype with redundant synchronized microphones: 14 air-conductive microphones and 2 bone-conductive units. In a study with 42 participants, we validated that combining sound-field and vibration features significantly improves authentication robustness and attack resistance. Furthermore, experiments demonstrated that AuthGlass maintains competitive accuracy even under various practical scenarios, highlighting its applicability and scalability for real-world deployment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.20731v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As designers become familiar with Generative AI, a new concept is emerging: Agentic AI. While generative AI produces output in response to prompts, agentic AI systems promise to perform mundane tasks autonomously, potentially freeing designers to focus on what they love: being creative. But how do designers feel about integrating agentic AI systems into their workflows? Through design fiction, we investigated how designers want to interact with a collaborative agentic AI platform. Ten professional designers imagined and discussed collaborating with an AI agent to organise inspiration sources and ideate. Our findings highlight the roles AI agents can play in supporting designers, the division of authority between humans and AI, and how designers' intent can be explained to AI agents beyond prompts. We synthesise our findings into a conceptual framework that identifies authority distribution among humans and AI agents and discuss directions for utilising AI agents in future design workflows.",

    "title": "Understanding Mode Switching in Human-AI Collaboration: Behavioral Insights and Predictive Modeling",
    "content": "arXiv:2509.20666v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human-AI collaboration is typically offered in one of two of user control levels: guidance, where the AI provides suggestions and the human makes the final decision, and delegation, where the AI acts autonomously within user-defined constraints. Systems that integrate both modes, common in robotic surgery or driving assistance, often overlook shifts in user preferences within a task in response to factors like evolving trust, decision complexity, and perceived control. In this work, we investigate how users dynamically switch between higher and lower levels of control during a sequential decision-making task. Using a hand-and-brain chess setup, participants either selected a piece and the AI decided how it moved (brain mode), or the AI selected a piece and the participant decided how it moved (hand mode). We collected over 400 mode-switching decisions from eight participants, along with gaze, emotional state, and subtask difficulty data. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in gaze patterns and subtask complexity prior to a switch and in the quality of the subsequent move. Based on these results, we engineered behavioral and task-specific features to train a lightweight model that predicted control level switches ($F1 = 0.65$). The model performance suggests that real-time behavioral signals can serve as a complementary input alongside system-driven mode-switching mechanisms currently used. We complement our quantitative results with qualitative factors that influence switching including perceived AI ability, decision complexity, and level of control, identified from post-game interview analysis. The combined behavioral and modeling insights can help inform the design of shared autonomy systems that need dynamic, subtask-level control switches aligned with user intent and evolving task demands.",

These methods change the 3D model geometry, which can compromise the model's structural integrity once fabricated. We present MechStyle, a system that enables creators to stylize 3D printable models while preserving their structural integrity. MechStyle accomplishes this by augmenting the Generative AI-based stylization process with feedback from a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation. As the stylization process modifies the geometry to approximate the desired style, feedback from the FEA simulation reduces modifications to regions with increased stress. We evaluate the effectiveness of FEA simulation feedback in the augmented stylization process by comparing three stylization control strategies. We also investigate the time efficiency of our approach by comparing three adaptive scheduling strategies. Finally, we demonstrate MechStyle's user interface that allows users to generate stylized and structurally viable 3D models and provide five example applications.",

Drawing on formative interviews that revealed organizational memory challenges in labs, we designed CHOIR, an LLM-based chatbot that supports organizational memory through four key functions: document-grounded Q&amp;A, Q&amp;A sharing for follow-up discussion, knowledge extraction from conversations, and AI-assisted document updates. We deployed CHOIR in four research labs for one month (n=21), where the lab members asked 107 questions and lab directors updated documents 38 times in the organizational memory. Our findings reveal a privacy-awareness tension: questions were asked privately, limiting directors' visibility into documentation gaps. Students often avoided contribution due to challenges in generalizing personal experiences into universal documentation. We contribute design implications for privacy-preserving awareness and supporting context-specific knowledge documentation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2508.16509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.",

Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain of the network into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which a network $\\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.\n  In this work, we leverage these properties to define an equivalence class $\\sim_\\Phi$ on top of an input dataset, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\\cap \\text{Im}\\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the \\textit{overlap decomposition} $\\mathcal{O}_\\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and an input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to quotient homology groups $H_k(\\Phi(\\mathcal{M})) \\simeq H_k(\\mathcal{M}/\\mathcal{O}_\\Phi)$. This lets us intrinsically calculate the Betti numbers of neural representations without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.\n  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our overlap homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on several classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.",

    "content": "arXiv:2507.16080v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) are increasingly hailed as powerful computational models of human speech perception. However, since their representations are inherently black-box, it remains unclear what drives their alignment with brain responses. To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six interpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features, speech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic features, and contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SFMs (Whisper, HuBERT, WavLM), quantifying electrocorticography (ECoG) response variance shared between feature classes. Variance-partitioning analyses revealed several key insights: First, the SFMs' alignment with the brain can be mostly explained by their ability to learn and encode simple interpretable speech features. Second, SFMs exhibit a systematic trade-off between encoding of brain-relevant low-level and high-level features across layers. Finally, our results show that SFMs learn brain-relevant semantics which cannot be explained by lower-level speech features, with this capacity increasing with model size and context length. Together, our findings suggest a principled approach to build more interpretable, accurate, and efficient encoding models of the brain by augmenting SFM embeddings with interpretable features.",

Building on locality-based accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability; current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.",

EEG was collected from 56 Cantonese, cognitively normal older adults (aged 60 - 70) while they listened to stimuli of four expressive styles that varied in prosody: scrambled, descriptive, dialogue, and exciting. Using encoding models to predict EEG signals from acoustic, segmentation, and phonotactic features, we found that greater subjective concern was associated with weaker cortical tracking of (1) higher-level linguistic features but not acoustic features and (2) less engaging stimuli (scrambled and descriptive styles) but not prosodically rich stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that early signs of cognitive impairment can be revealed from speech perception via cortical tracking, especially while listening to prosodically flat speech.",

We applied striatum-targeted tTIS to healthy participants performing an effort-based decision task during functional MRI scanning. Supporting the idea that the striatum encodes both the benefits and costs of actions, we found that, on the behavioral level, striatum-targeted tTIS increased the sensitivity to both reward magnitudes and effort costs. At the neural level, this was mirrored by stronger representations of effort demands in the striatum under stimulation as well as by enhanced functional coupling between the striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex, a region at the intersection of motivation and cognition. Together, our findings provide insights into the causal contributions of the striatum to trading-off rewards against effort costs, informing neural accounts of motivated cognition and suggesting novel neural interventions for the treatment of amotivation.",

    "content": "Reconstructing speech from neural recordings is crucial for understanding speech coding and developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, existing methods trade off acoustic richness (pitch, prosody) for linguistic intelligibility (words, phonemes). To overcome this limitation, we propose a dual-path framework to concurrently decode acoustic and linguistic representations. The acoustic pathway uses a long-short term memory (LSTM) decoder and a high-fidelity generative adversarial network (HiFi-GAN) to reconstruct spectrotemporal features. The linguistic pathway employs a transformer adaptor and text-to-speech (TTS) generator for word tokens. These two pathways merge via voice cloning to combine both acoustic and linguistic validity. Using only 20 minutes of electrocorticography (ECoG) data per subject, our approach achieves highly intelligible synthesized speech (mean opinion score = 4.0/5.0, word error rate = 18.9%). Our dual-path framework reconstructs natural and intelligible speech from ECoG, resolving the acoustic-linguistic trade-off.",

    "content": "Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible RNA betacoronavirus, causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in a broad spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic or mild to a severe, deadly illness. Emerging evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 affects host gene regulation through epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, potentially contributing to immune dysregulation and post-acute sequelae, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the extent and functional relevance of these epigenetic changes remain uncertain. Methods and results We employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to profile DNA methylation in peripheral blood from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients across a spectrum of symptom severity, ranging from asymptomatic to severe (n=101), in comparison to SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals (n=105). We observed a widespread hypomethylation in the genomes of infected individuals, which was more pronounced in severe cases. Notably, we identified differentially methylated genes in patients with mild (19 genes), moderate (19 genes), and severe (35 genes) symptoms. These genes included those involved in canonical immune responses as well as known to be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis further supported the significant association between the differentially methylated genes and those implicated in Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, as well as neuropsychiatric conditions, suggesting potential epigenetic links between acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and long-term neurological outcomes. This is one of the first studies to comprehensively map severity-stratified genome-wide DNA methylation changes in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Our findings underscore the potential importance of epigenetic regulation in the acute responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight an overlap with epigenetic mechanisms relevant for neuropsychiatric disease processes.",

    "title": "A specialized cold sensing system in the naked mole-rat",
    "content": "Avoiding cold or seeking warmth are universal animal needs. Homeothermic mammals maintain a constant body temperature despite fluctuating ambient temperatures. One exception is the naked mole-rat which lacks effective thermogenesis. We show that the naked mole-rat has evolved a greatly expanded cold sensing system. Compared to mice, this species has many more cold-sensitive sensory neurons and most express the cold-activated TRPM8 channel. The naked mole-rat TrpM8 gene harbors a unique upstream exon that when translated produces a TRPM8 protein with a 71 amino acid N-terminal extension. When expressed, the N-terminal extension prevents membrane targeting and abolishes TRPM8 function. Splice forms lacking the extension formed functional cold and menthol activated channels in vivo. Additionally, many naked mole-rat sensory neurons use a TRPM8-independent mechanism to detect cold. Thus, we identified molecular changes that confer both sensitivity and flexibility to cold sensing in a species that is critically dependent on following thermal cues.",

    "title": "Proteolytic cleavage of G3BP1 by calpain 1 couples NMDAR activation to mTOR-dependent local translation",
    "content": "Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are dynamic, membraneless organelles that sequester translationally repressed mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of localized protein synthesis. While disassembly of RNP granules is essential for reactivating translation, the mechanisms by which neuronal activity regulates this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) triggers calcium influx, leading to activation of calpain 1 and subsequent proteolytic cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1), a core component of stress granules. This cleavage results in the disassembly of G3BP1 granules in the neurites and promotes mTOR-dependent local translation, thereby linking synaptic activity to spatially restricted protein synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that the NMDAR-calpain 1-G3BP1-mTOR signaling axis contributes to axonal regeneration, establishing proteolytic remodeling of RNP granules as a key mechanism of activity-dependent neural repair, with potential implications for therapeutic intervention in brain injury.",

    "title": "Brain-wide representational drift: memory consolidation and entropic force",
    "content": "Memory engrams change on the microscopic level with time and experience as the neurons that compose them switch in a process termed representational drift. On the macroscopic level the engrams are not static either: numbers of engram neurons in different brain regions change over time, which is considered to reflect the process of memory consolidation. Here we predict a link between these two levels, using a novel statistical physics approach to engram modeling. Importantly, it is general as it makes only minimal assumptions on the engram's nature, does not rely on a specific architecture, and its fundamental implications hold for any representational drift with random component. Our first, analytically well tractable model shows that an entropic force emerges at the region level from random representational drift at the neuronal level. We refine the model by incorporating the interaction of the entropic force with biological processes that shape neuronal engrams. Here, the connectivity between the brain regions strongly influences the (quasi-)equilibrium engram distribution. The obtained distributions are in qualitative agreement with the ones of a biologically detailed drifting assembly model. Our engram description allows to predict the engram evolution in large neuronal systems such as the mouse brain. We find several predictions that are consistent across the valid tested parameter ranges, such as a strong tendency of the engram to leave the hippocampus. The results suggest that the brain operates in a regime where engrams drift, both deterministically and randomly, to allow for memory consolidation.",

    "title": "CS - plasticity and behavioral-state integration in the posterior insula during auditory fear learning",
    "content": "During fear learning, animals learn to associate sensory cues (conditioned stimulus, CS) with aversive outcomes, and neurons in several brain areas become entrained to the CS. The posterior insular cortex (pInsCx) contains representations of internal states and sensory cues, amongst them auditory stimuli. Nevertheless, the possibility of plastic encoding of auditory responses in the pInsCx during fear learning, and its underlying synaptic mechanisms have not been addressed. Using single-unit recordings in the pInsCx of male mice during fear learning, we find that ~ 10% of putative principal neurons acquire a response to an auditory CS during fear learning (\"CS learners\"). CS learners are enriched in the insula auditory field (IAF) of the dorsal pInsCx, and strongly overlap with a larger neuronal subpopulation which increases its activity during movement initiation. Using optogenetic circuit mapping, we find that the IAF receives glutamatergic synapses from the non-lemniscal auditory thalamus and the auditory cortex (A1); fear learning induces a postsynaptic form of LTP at the cortical, but not at the thalamic input synapse. Combined single-unit recordings and optogenetic axon silencing showed that the acquired CS-response during fear recall depends on transmission at the A1 [-&gt;] pInsCx synapse. Our study shows that the pInsCx generates a plastic representation of an auditory CS during fear learning, driven by LTP of an associative cortical input. Future work should further investigate how the integration of CS- and movement information in the insula contributes to the expression of auditory-cued fear memories.",

When mixing synchronous and asynchronous context managers, developers must use deeply nested statements or use risky workarounds such as overuse of <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.AsyncExitStack\"><code>AsyncExitStack</code></a>.</p> <p>We therefore propose to allow <code>with</code> statements to accept both synchronous and asynchronous context managers in a single statement by prefixing individual async context managers with the <code>async</code> keyword.</p> <p>This change eliminates unnecessary nesting, improves code readability, and improves ergonomics without making async code any less explicit.</p> <h1>Motivation</h1> <p>Modern Python applications frequently need to acquire multiple resources, via a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous context managers. While the all-sync or all-async cases permit a single statement with multiple context managers, mixing the two results in the \u201cstaircase of doom\u201d:</p> <pre><code>async def process_data(): async with acquire_lock() as lock: with temp_directory() as tmpdir: async with connect_to_db(cache=tmpdir) as db: with open('config.json', encoding='utf-8') as f: # We're now 16 spaces deep before any actual logic config = json.load(f) await db.execute(config['query']) # ... more processing </code></pre> <p>This excessive indentation discourages use of context managers, despite their desirable semantics. See the <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/#rejected-ideas\">Rejected Ideas</a> section for current workarounds and commentary on their downsides.</p> <p>With this PEP, the function could instead be written:</p> <pre><code>async def process_data(): with ( async acquire_lock() as lock, temp_directory() as tmpdir, async connect_to_db(cache=tmpdir) as db, open('config.json', encoding='utf-8') as f, ): config = json.load(f) await db.execute(config['query']) # ... more processing </code></pre> <p>This compact alternative avoids forcing a new level of indentation on every switch between sync and async context managers. At the same time, it uses only existing keywords, distinguishing async code with the <code>async</code> keyword more precisely even than our current syntax.</p> <p>We do not propose that the <code>async with</code> statement should ever be deprecated, and indeed advocate its continued use for single-line statements so that \u201casync\u201d is the first non-whitespace token of each line opening an async context manager.</p> <p>Our proposal nonetheless permits <code>with async some_ctx()</code>, valuing consistent syntax design over enforcement of a single code style which we expect will be handled by style guides, linters, formatters, etc. See <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/ban-single-line-with-async\">here</a> for further discussion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kirara0048\"> /u/kirara0048 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nqnm44/pep_806_mixed_syncasync_context_managers_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nqnm44/pep_806_mixed_syncasync_context_managers_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN,<p>Macscope is a new window manager and and app switcher for macOS built on the philosophy of enhancing, not replacing, your existing muscle memory.<p>It works by augmenting the familiar Cmd+Tab workflow. A quick tap of your shortcut instantly switches between recent apps, just like you're used to. A slightly longer hold, however, opens the full Macscope interface where you can manage all your open windows and tabs.<p>You can also use modifier shortcuts to enter Placement Modes, which let you instantly snap a selected window to the left/right/top/bottom/ half of your screen.<p>Here are some of the key features:<p>- Unified Search & Switch: A single interface to instantly find and switch to any window, browser tab (Safari, Chrome, Arc, etc.), or application just by typing.<p>- Live Previews: See a real-time preview of what's inside each window so you know exactly where you're going. You can also disable previews for a more minimal experience.<p>- Advanced Window Management: Go beyond just switching. Select multiple windows and arrange them into layouts like vertical/horizontal splits or grids.<p>- Scopes: Save collections of app windows as a \"Scope\" and instantly restore that entire workspace later. It's ideal for quickly switching between different projects or tasks.<p>It\u2019s a native macOS app built with Swift and supports both Apple Silicon and Intel machines.<p>Launch Offer for HN:<p>There's a free trial with 250 actions.

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

    "content": "arXiv:2509.20106v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study explores how prior exposure to physical objects influences the quality and realism perception of Digital Twins (DT) with varying levels of fidelity in Virtual Reality (VR). In a mixed experimental design, 24 participants were divided into two equal groups: an exposure group, in which members were shown physical objects before inspecting and rating their replicas in VR, and a control group without prior knowledge. Three objects were presented, each under four fidelity conditions with varying texture resolution and geometric detail. Participants rated perceived quality and realism through in-VR self-reports. Statistical analysis revealed that texture resolution significantly affected realism and quality perception, whereas geometric detail only influenced quality ratings. Investigating the between-factor, no significant effect of exposure on quality and realism perception was found. These findings raise important questions about the cognitive relationship between physical objects and their digital counterparts and how fidelity influences the perception of DTs in VR.",

Visual neuroprosthetics offer a promising solution, leveraging advancements in technology to provide a simplified visual sense through devices comprising cameras, computers, and implanted electrodes. This study investigates user-centered design principles for a phosphene vision algorithm, utilizing feedback from visually impaired individuals to guide the development of a gaze-controlled semantic segmentation system. We conducted interviews revealing key design principles. These principles informed the implementation of a gaze-guided semantic segmentation algorithm using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In a simulated phosphene vision environment, participants performed object detection tasks under SAM, edge detection, and normal vision conditions. SAM improved identification accuracy over edge detection, remained effective in complex scenes, and was particularly robust for specific object shapes. These findings demonstrate the value of user feedback and the potential of gaze-guided semantic segmentation to enhance neuroprosthetic vision.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.19680v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As LLMs gain adoption in high-stakes domains like mental health, domain experts are increasingly consulted to provide input into policies governing their behavior. From an observation of 19 policymaking workshops with 9 experts over 15 weeks, we identified opportunities to better support rapid experimentation, feedback, and iteration for collaborative policy design processes. We present PolicyPad, an interactive system that facilitates the emerging practice of LLM policy prototyping by drawing from established UX prototyping practices, including heuristic evaluation and storyboarding. Using PolicyPad, policy designers can collaborate on drafting a policy in real time while independently testing policy-informed model behavior with usage scenarios. We evaluate PolicyPad through workshops with 8 groups of 22 domain experts in mental health and law, finding that PolicyPad enhanced collaborative dynamics during policy design, enabled tight feedback loops, and led to novel policy contributions. Overall, our work paves participatory paths for advancing AI alignment and safety.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.19653v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Decentralizing the governance of social computing systems to communities promises to empower them to make independent decisions, with nuance and in accordance with their values. Yet, communities do not govern in isolation. Many problems communities face are common, or move across their boundaries. We therefore propose designing for \"inter-community governance:\" mechanisms that support relationships and interactions between communities to coordinate on governance issues. Drawing from workshops with 24 individuals on decentralized, community-run social media, we present six challenges in designing for inter-community governance surfaced through ideas proposed in workshops. Together, these ideas come together as an ecosystem of resources, infrastructures, and tools that highlight three key principles for designing for inter-community governance: modularity, forkability, and polycentricity. We end with a discussion of how the ideas proposed in workshops might be implemented in future work aiming to support community governance in social computing systems broadly.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.19643v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Community engagement processes in representative political contexts, like school districts, generate massive volumes of feedback that overwhelm traditional synthesis methods, creating barriers to shared understanding not only between civic leaders and constituents but also among community members. To address these barriers, we developed StoryBuilder, a human-AI collaborative pipeline that transforms community input into accessible first-person narratives. Using 2,480 community responses from an ongoing school rezoning process, we generated 124 composite stories and deployed them through a mobile-friendly StorySharer interface. Our mixed-methods evaluation combined a four-month field deployment, user studies with 21 community members, and a controlled experiment examining how narrative composition affects participant reactions. Field results demonstrate that narratives helped community members relate across diverse perspectives. In the experiment, experience-grounded narratives generated greater respect and trust than opinion-heavy narratives. We contribute a human-AI narrative synthesis system and insights on its varied acceptance and effectiveness in a real-world civic context.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.19615v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Personalized recommendation algorithms deliver content to the user on most major social media platforms. While these algorithms are crucial for helping users find relevant content, users lack meaningful control over them. This reduces users' sense of agency and their ability to adapt social media feeds to their own needs and values. Efforts have been made to give users more control over their feeds, but usability remains a major barrier to adoption. Drawing upon prior work in designing teachable social media feeds, we built Pilot, a novel system of controls and feedback mechanisms on BlueSky that are expressive, intuitive, and integrated directly into the feed to allow users to customize their feed while they browse. Our user study suggests the system increases the user's sense of agency, and encourages them to think more critically about curating their feeds. We synthesize design implications for enhancing user agency over social media feeds.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.19600v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective time management during presentations is challenging, particularly for Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) individuals, as existing tools often lack accessibility and multimodal feedback. To address this gap, we developed vashTimer: a free, open-source, and accessible iOS application. This paper demonstrates the design and functionality of vashTimer, which provides presenters with a robust tool for temporal awareness. The application delivers highly customizable alerts across four distinct modalities: visual, auditory, speech, and haptic; and supports multiple configurable intervals within a single session. By offering a flexible and non-intrusive time management solution, vashTimer empowers presenters of all visual abilities. The implications of this work extend beyond public speaking to any professional, such as a clinical therapist, who requires discreet temporal cues, fostering greater independence and focus for a wide range of users. This demonstration serves as the foundation for a planned formal user evaluation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.19574v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding user intent during magnified reading is critical for accessible interface design. Yet magnification collapses visual context and forces continual viewport dragging, producing fragmented, noisy gaze and obscuring reading intent. We present a semi-supervised framework that learns intention-aware gaze representations by leveraging mouse trajectories as weak supervision. The model is first pretrained to predict mouse velocity from unlabeled gaze, then fine-tuned to classify reading versus scanning. To address magnification-induced distortions, we jointly model raw gaze within the magnified viewport and a compensated view remapped to the original screen, which restores spatial continuity across lines and paragraphs. Across text and webpage datasets, our approach consistently outperforms supervised baselines, with semi-supervised pretraining yielding up to 7.5% F1 improvement in challenging settings. These findings highlight the value of behavior-driven pretraining for robust, gaze-only interaction, paving the way for adaptive, hands-free accessibility tools.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.19515v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Relationships with social artificial intelligence (AI) agents are on the rise. People report forming friendships, mentorships, and romantic partnerships with chatbots such as Replika, a type of social AI agent that is designed specifically for companionship. Concerns that companion chatbot relationships may harm or replace human ones have been raised, but whether and how these social consequences occur remains unclear. Prior research suggests that people's states of social need and their anthropomorphism of the AI agent may play a role in how human-AI interaction impacts human-human interaction. In this longitudinal study (N = 183), participants were randomly assigned to converse with a companion chatbot over text or to play text-based word games for 10 minutes a day for 21 consecutive days. During these 21 days, participants also completed four surveys and two audio-recorded interviews. We found that people's social health and relationships were not significantly impacted by interacting with a companion chatbot across 21 days compared to the control group. However, people who had a higher desire to socially connect anthropomorphized the chatbot more. Those who anthropomorphized the chatbot more indicated that the human-chatbot interaction had greater impacts on their social interactions and relationships with family and friends. A mediation analysis suggested that the impact of human-AI interaction on human-human social outcomes was mediated by the extent to which people anthropomorphized the AI agent, which itself was related to the desire to socially connect.",

Each agent maintains a self-model that tracks violations in its predictive coherence while recursively modeling the other. Valence is computed from self-model prediction error, weighted by self-relevance, and modulated by prior affective states and by what we term temporal aiming, which captures affective appraisal over time. This accommodates shifts in the self-other boundary, allowing affect to emerge at individual and dyadic levels. We propose a novel method termed geometric hyperscanning, based on the Forman-Ricci curvature, to empirically operationalize these processes: it tracks topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, with its entro-py serving as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.",

In this study, our objective is to delve into the internals of VLMs to interpret the functions of individual neurons. We observe the activations of neurons with respects to the input visual tokens and text tokens, and reveal some interesting findings. Particularly, we found that there are neurons responsible for only visual or text information, or both, respectively, which we refer to them as visual neurons, text neurons, and multi-modal neurons, respectively. We build a framework that automates the explanation of neurons with the assistant of GPT-4o. Meanwhile, for visual neurons, we propose an activation simulator to assess the reliability of the explanations for visual neurons.

    "content": "arXiv:2509.20216v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Multilayer networks provide a framework to study complex systems with multiple types of interactions, multiple dynamical processes, and/or multiple subsystems. When studying a dynamical process on a multilayer network, it is important to consider how both layer structure and heterogeneity across layers impacts the overall dynamics. As a concrete example, we study Ising dynamics on multilayer networks and investigate how network structure affects its qualitative features. We focus primarily on multiplex networks, which are multilayer networks in which interlayer edges occur only between manifestations of the same entity on different layers, although we also consider one empirical example with a more general multilayer structure. We use numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation to examine the steady-state behavior of the Ising dynamics as a function of temperature (which is a key model parameter) for a variety of two-layer multilayer networks from both models and empirical data. We examine both the steady-state behavior and a metastable state in which the two layers are anti-aligned, and we explore the effects of interlayer coupling strength and structural heterogeneity. In synthetic multilayer networks with core--periphery structure, we show that interlayer edges that involve peripheral nodes can exert more influence than interlayer edges that involve only core nodes. Finally, we consider empirical multilayer networks from biological and social systems. Our work illustrates how heterogeneity across the layers of a multilayer network influences dynamics on the whole network.",

Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell (KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom body circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability to distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that incorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model, we generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection neuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number of KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights, among other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs consistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The developmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's output. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating developmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning capacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON synaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation experiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed rewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit. Our study furthers our understanding of olfactory neuroplasticity and provides important clues to understanding learning and memory in general. Understanding how the olfactory circuits process and learn can also have potential applications in artificial intelligence and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",

METHODS: We presented an integrative analysis framework using single-nucleus transcriptomic with matched subject-level genotype data from 272 human AD in the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) study, and constructed causality-based, cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). RESULTS: Our method identifies regulatory genes from both transcription factors (TFs) and non-TFs, thereby capturing a complete and accurate causal regulatory map across different brain cell types. This work revealed both established and novel regulations, pathways, and cell-type-unique hub genes in AD. Beyond constructing transcriptome-wide GRNs, we quantitatively assessed hub genes and distinguished those with regulatory or responsive roles. DISCUSSION: Our study provides a comprehensive mapping of cell-type-specific causal GRNs in AD, providing a powerful resource for dynamic pathway exploration, hypothesis generation, and functional interpretation.",

    "content": "Disease-associated glia represent plastic transcriptional cellular states observed across neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). In particular, microglial states have been characterized in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of amyloidosis. Although single-cell transcriptomic technologies have increased the dimensionality of information available across cell states, few studies have systematically tested for changes in glial transcription across brain regions and disease states. Here, we report a statistical framework for glial annotation, disease association, and transcriptional profiling, which facilitate identification of generalizable glial states that are present across a spectrum of NDDs (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Frontotemporal dementia). We identify seven astrocyte substates, 14 microglia/myeloid substates, and five oligodendrocyte substates where transcriptional variability is attributable to region, disease, or batch effects. Regional heterogeneity of astrocytes masked disease associations, even within cortical astrocytes. We found only limited oligodendrocyte transcriptional heterogeneity, resulting in few substates for further interrogation. Notably, microglia showed the strongest evidence for disease association. We show, for the first time, that this association exists across the entire NDD spectrum. Using latent factor analysis, we created a consensus human neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia (hnDAM) signature, which we experimentally validated in 11 independent sample series. We demonstrate that the hnDAM signature is a statistically testable biomarker for conserved microglial activation in NDDs by: i) comparing to murine DAM-like signatures, ii) performing transcription factor analysis, and iii) modeling transcriptional reprogramming perturbations in iPSC-derived microglia. Taken together, this work broadens our understanding of glial activation across neuropathologies and reveals hnDAM as a putative therapeutic target that can be widely generalized to patients suffering from NDDs.",

    "title": "Exponential Map Models as an Interpretable Framework for Generating Neural Spatial Representations",
    "content": "A fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI is understanding how physical space is mapped into neural representations. While artificial neural networks can generate brain-like spatial representations, such as place and grid cells, their black-box nature makes it difficult to determine if these representations arise as general solutions or as artifacts of a chosen architecture, objective function, or training protocol. Critically, these models offer no guarantee that learned solutions for core navigational tasks, like path integration (updating position from self-motion), will generalize beyond their training data. To address these challenges, we introduce a first-principles framework based on an exponential map model. Instead of using deep networks or gradient optimization, the presented model uses generator matrices to map physical locations into neural representations through the matrix exponential, creating a transparent framework that allows us to identify several exact algebraic conditions underlying key properties of neural maps. We show that path invariance (ensuring location representations are independent of traversal route) is achieved if the generators commute, while translational invariance (maintaining consistent spatial relationships across locations) demands generators producing orthogonal transformations. We also show that preserving the metric of flat space requires the eigenvalues of the generator matrices to form sets of roots of unity. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed framework constructs diverse biologically relevant spatial tuning, including place cells, grid cells, and context-dependent remapping. The framework we propose thus offers a transparent, theoretically-grounded alternative to black-box models, revealing the exact conditions required for a coherent neural map of space.",

    "title": "A dNmnat-sensitized in vivo platform for unbiased discovery of regulators of neurodegeneration",
    "content": "Axon degeneration drives nervous system dysfunction in diverse neurological diseases and injuries. While key regulators of injury-induced Wallerian degeneration have been identified, approaches have largely relied on axotomy, a particularly extreme injury for a neuron. Here, we developed a forward genetic screening platform in the adult Drosophila wing that sensitizes neurons to degeneration through depletion of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (dNmnat), the essential NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We screened 9,393 mutagenized chromosomes and recovered 59 mutations that suppress neurodegeneration induced by dNmant depletion, including the known pro-degenerative molecule dSarm, thereby validating our approach. We show loss of CG4098, the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian enzyme NUDT9, robustly preserved axons and induced widespread remodeling of NAD-related metabolites, which provides a new link between cADP-ribose hydrolase activity and neuronal survival. We further show mutations in the transcription factor Abrupt resulted in elevated dNmnat protein levels and blocked axon degeneration, suggesting Abrupt normally tunes dNmnat levels and neuronal NAD homeostasis. dNmnat depletion is thus a versatile approach for unbiased discovery of axon death pathway components, each of which may provide new entry points for therapeutic strategies to preserve axons in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "content": "The human brain needs distributed, time-critical computation to efficiently solve complex problems. Turbulence provides such highly efficient spacetime information processing and transmission across wide-spread brain networks, yet we have been missing a mechanistic understanding of the interactions of turbulent vortices underlying human cognition. Here, we build the first whole-brain model of turbulent vortices as defined by the levels of local synchronisation in brain signals quantifying turbulent interactions in vortex space. Specifically, using large-scale human neuroimaging data, we found that the interactions of turbulent vortices is an excellent framework for understanding cognition and brain computation. It is not only useful for distinguishing the detailed spacetime dynamics of rest and cognition - but can even distinguish between subtle sub-components of cognitive tasks, where manipulation of vortices can be shown to change cognition. Overall, this whole-brain framework creates a natural vortex space for the brain computation underlying cognition, as well as potentially providing novel ways of controlling turbulent interactions in disease.",

    "content": "Background: Antibodies against amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) are the only therapies capable of slowing cognitive decline and reducing A{beta} plaque burden in Alzheimer disease (AD). Yet the precise sites where antibodies engage A{beta} in the brain, and the mechanisms that drive A{beta} clearance, are not fully defined. Defining the A{beta} antibody engagement with A{beta} in brain is essential to understand how immunotherapy can be beneficial for AD. Methods: We administered the well-establsihed N-terminal A{beta} antibody 6E10 via intrahippocampal (IH), cisterna magna (CM), or intraperitoneal (IP) injection in AD mouse models. N-terminal A{beta} antibodies were seen as most effective in AD mouse models. Antibody 6E10 was not only assessed in A{beta} plaques, but also examined in association with diverse brain cells and vascular compartments. Glymphatic dynamics were evaluated following A{beta} antibody treatment. Results: As expected, A{beta} antibody 6E10 bound to A{beta} plaques but remarkably also localized to vulnerable neurons, such as hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, as well as microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, perivascular macrophages (PVMs), and blood vessels. Glymphatic function showed no significant alterations after antibody administration. Conclusions: A{beta} antibodies distribute not only to amyloid plaques but also to neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels. This study provides detailed localizations of antibody in the AD brain, offering valuable insights into cellular targets and spatial dynamics of A{beta} antibody-based immunotherapy.",

    "title": "Vision dominates sound in mediating classic cue-induced microsaccadic eye movement modulations in rhesus macaque monkeys",
    "content": "Visual onsets in the environment cause a short-latency reduction in saccade generation likelihood. Concomitant with that, the metrics of the saccades that do happen near the time of saccadic inhibition reflect the landscape of stimulus-driven neural responses in topographically organized brain maps. While certain aspects of saccadic inhibition have already been explored from a neurophysiological perspective, several questions remain, including which sensory-motor pathways propagate visual input information to the final oculomotor control circuitry with such short latencies. Here, motivated by evidence of a dissociation between temporal and spatial aspects of saccadic inhibition, we devised behavioral paradigms experimentally manipulating either aspect. Rhesus macaque monkeys maintained gaze fixation, and we characterized visually-driven microsaccadic inhibition with and without paired auditory pulses. In one condition, the sound pulses were spatially-unbiased, thus only affecting the temporal processes associated with microsaccadic inhibition; in another, the pulses were spatially-biased, affecting both the temporal and spatial components. We found that sound pulses alone barely affected microsaccade rates. However, when paired with visual stimuli, they accelerated the timing of visually-driven microsaccadic inhibition by ~14-18 ms. In terms of microsaccade directions, spatially-unbiased sounds interfered with, but did not eliminate, visually-driven direction modulations. Surprisingly, spatially-biased sounds had a much weaker effect on microsaccade direction modulations, even when the sound source was in the opposite hemifield as the appearing visual stimulus. We conclude that vision dominates sound in mediating classic microsaccadic inhibition, and we argue that our paradigms are ideal for neurophysiological investigations of the parallel sensory-motor pathways contributing to such inhibition.",

    "title": "Whole-Brain Models of Minimal Phenomenal Experience: Approaching Criticality through Jhana Meditation",
    "content": "Minimal phenomenal experiences (MPE) provide a distinctive entry point for investigating consciousness and understanding how certain meditative practices may represent and contribute to human flourishing. Adopting a neurophenomenological stance, we combine first-person phenomenology with formal whole-brain modeling to ask what mechanisms underlie MPE states and the progression towards it, as reached through jh[a]na meditation, a type of advanced concentrative absorption meditation (ACAM-J). We used a dataset of advanced practitioners performing the eight ACAM-J states scanned in high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each state, we build a mechanistic whole-brain model that reproduces brain activity by modeling the dynamical regimes of different resting-state networks. We found that the later ACAM-J states, taken here as candidates for MPE, show a shift of functional network dynamics toward near-bifurcation working points. The default mode network exhibits the largest shift, from a distant noise-driven regime at a control condition to near-critical dynamics. We also observed that the pathway to MPE is non-linear, with prominent reconfigurations at key meditative milestones. Our results suggest that MPE corresponds to a globally susceptible state where near-critical dynamics dominate. We interpret this critical regime as a form of \"openness\", where the usual hierarchical and heterogeneous patterns of brain activity give way to generalized flexibility. In this light, MPE provides both a minimal model of consciousness and a window into how advanced meditation can profoundly reshape brain dynamics.",

    "title": "RHO1-2 meganuclease gene editing targets human P23H rhodopsin-induced retinitis pigmentosa to rejuvenate rods and maintain cones",
    "content": "Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive vision loss and eventual blindness. The P23H mutation (proline to histidine substitution at codon 23) in the rhodopsin (RHO) gene represents the most common form of adRP in North Americans. Currently, there is no cure for P23H adRP. Genome editing targeting the mutant RHO allele, leaving a functional wildtype (WT) allele, is an attractive approach for P23H adRP, as only one copy of RHO is needed for normal retinal function. We re-engineered an I-Cre meganuclease, called RHO1-2, to target a 22bp recognition sequence encompassing the mutation responsible for the p.P23H RHO mutation. In vitro, RHO1-2, cuts human P23H RHO but not WT RHO. In vivo, we delivered scAAV5:GRK1:RHO1-2 via subretinal injection in early-stage degeneration using the only large animal model of human p.P23H RHO adRP (TgP23H pigs). We tested RHO1-2 efficacy and durability, on retinal function using full-field electroretinograms and on retinal structure using spectral domain optical coherence tomography and immunohistochemistry. We observe that RHO1-2 treatment: arrests rod photoreceptor degeneration, resurrects rod-driven retinal function that does not exist in untreated TgP23H pigs, restores mislocalized rhodopsin expression and rebuilds rod inner and outer segments (IS/OS). Rod rescue maintains cones. A year after RHO1-2 treatment, we show that TgP23H pigs use rod-driven vision to navigate a maze. Our results demonstrate that genome editing via RHO1-2 meganuclease is a viable treatment to cure human p.P23H RHO adRP. They also suggest that meganuclease-based editors can be effective for other IRDs.",

    "content": "Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness, sensory loss, autonomic dysfunction, and chronic neuropathic pain. The mediators responsible for driving early autoimmune injury in the most common GBS variant, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), remain incompletely understood. We performed bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from early untreated AIDP-variant GBS patients and healthy controls to comprehensively deduce leukocyte transcriptome alterations and predict disease-driving interactions between pathogenic leukocytes and peripheral nervous system cells. Bulk transcriptomics showed interferon- and JAK/STAT-driven proinflammatory signatures in myeloid cells. CD8+ T-cells were highly proliferative and expressed axon guidance genes. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed dysregulation of CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory and CD4+ effector memory T-cells indicative of poorly controlled type 1 and type 17 immune responses. Highly activated intermediate monocytes upregulated genes related to angiogenesis and oncostatin M. Interactome analysis between GBS leukocytes, Schwann cells, and sensory neurons predicted increased engagement of ligand-receptor pairs with nerve integrity and pain functions, including epiregulin, interferon-beta, adrenomedullin, clusterin, IL-6, IL-15, and CCL4. Functional validation demonstrated that CCL4 sensitizes human sensory neurons in vitro. These results unearth molecular interactions by which specific leukocyte populations in AIDP-variant GBS may induce peripheral nerve injury and drive neuropathic pain.",

    "content": "The output mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) of the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) are coupled through both chemical mechanisms as well as gap junctions that are mediated by connexin 36 (Cx36). Here we tested both behavioral and physiological effects of eliminating gap junctions in knockout (KO) mice with homozygous deletions of Cx36. In a go/no-go associative learning task, Cx36 KO mice were found to display reduced discrimination capabilities when presented with pairs of stimuli that included a monomolecular odor and mixtures that had the same monomolecular odor and a small amount of a structurally similar odor. The impairments did not occur for less similar odor pairs, suggesting that Cx36 KO mice have olfactory processing deficits that are specific to fine odor discrimination. In physiological recordings in OB slices from Cx36 KO mice, MCs displayed reduced excitation in response to electrical stimulation of sensory afferents, both single stimulus pulses as well as a theta burst pattern designed to mimic sniffing. The reduction in MC excitatory current was most prominent for late portions of their response, 300 ms after single stimulus pulses or following all theta bursts that came after the first. More global local field potentials recorded in OB glomeruli were largely unaffected by Cx36 KO. We suggest that the KO-induced impairments in fine odor discrimination are linked to reduced late MC excitation due to the longer time that mice require to make difficult odor discriminations.",

    "content": "Previous studies investigating edge-orientation discrimination capacity either stimulated an immobilized finger at limited speeds, or did not manipulate movement speed during active exploration. Here we tested the effect of movement speed on edge-orientation discrimination, including very slow and fast speeds. Participants were instructed to move their finger across two pairs of edges while matching their speed to a visual cue. One edge pair was parallel and the other non parallel to varying degrees. Participants were asked to identify the non parallel pair of edges. We report three main findings. First, consistent with previous reports, when they were free to choose their movement speed, participants moved at an average speed of ~29 mm/s (range: 15-52 mm/s). Second, there was no correlation between a participant's natural speed and their edge orientation discrimination capacity. Third, participants got better at edge orientation discrimination at slower than average speeds (5mm/s), and worse at higher than average speeds (90 and 180 mm/s). This change in performance was correlated with their relative change in movement speed.",

    "content": "Disease modifying therapies targeting specific molecular disease processes are becoming increasingly available for neurodegenerative disorders. However, profiling molecular features of neurodegeneration in living patients is challenging due to limited accessibility to brain tissue. In this work, we demonstrate that we can infer cell type presence and expression of molecular pathways at a sub-cortical level from ultra-high resolution 7T quantitative MRI by leveraging in-depth molecular characterisation of spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to characterising disease by predicting molecular features in a Parkinson's disease cohort. From qMRI data we predict disruption to the distribution of oligodendrocytes in the grey-matter cortex consistent with altered oligodendrocyte maturation. Our method contributes to advancing precision medicine in neurodegeneration, with promising attributes including cost-effectiveness, tolerability and clinical accessibility, with potential for clinical impact.",

    "title": "Cortical beta coherence provides a stronger non-invasive predictor of movement vigor than local beta power",
    "content": "Background: Movement elicits a robust decrease in motor cortical beta-band ({beta} ; 13-30 Hz) power contralateral to the moving limb. On this basis, studies have targeted contralateral motor cortical {beta} power to decode or modulate movement vigor (initiation and execution speed) non-invasively. Yet, reported behavioral effects and decoding accuracy remain modest. Considering that controlling vigor involves distributed brain regions, network-level metrics that capture interactions between cortical regions may track changes in vigor more accurately than local power. We therefore tested whether {beta} cortico-cortical coherence, measured as functional connectivity between contralateral motor cortex and other cortical areas, predicts movement vigor more reliably than {beta} power. Methods: Thirty healthy participants performed right hand opening at two instructed speeds (Fast, Slow), while high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. EEG data were source-localized, and analyses were conducted at the sensor and source levels. We compared {beta} power and {beta} coherence in their ability to discriminate Fast from Slow condition. Effects were assessed across the whole scalp/cortex and using subject-specific selections of electrodes/parcels optimized for discrimination. Results: Fast trials exhibited shorter movement time (MT) and reaction time (RT) than Slow trials, indicating higher vigor. No electrodes cluster showed any significant {beta} power difference between Fast and Slow conditions. With subject-specific channel selection, {beta} power discriminated vigor above chance in most participants, but the polarity of the {beta} power contrast (Fast < Slow or Fast > Slow) varied across individuals. In contrast, with subject-specific parcel selection, {beta} coherence was consistently reduced during Fast relative to Slow in the majority of participants. Across participants, lower {beta} coherence, but not {beta} power, was significantly associated with larger Slow-Fast vigor difference. Conclusions: {beta} cortico-cortical coherence between contralateral motor cortex and other cortical regions provided a more robust and consistent predictor of movement vigor than contralateral motor cortical {beta} power. {beta} coherence exhibited a sustained reduction during fast movements across trials and participants, supporting its use as target for non-invasive neuromodulation of vigor and as feature for decoding intended movement speed.",

    "title": "Modeling the Memory of Unmyelinated Axons: Integration of a Data-Driven Approach with Physiological Memory Concept",
    "content": "In this study, we present a simplified and resource-efficient computational model to predict activity-dependent conduction velocity changes of action in unmyelinated axons. This model serves as a complementary tool to Hodgkin-Huxley models. Our approach is based on the concept of \"memory,\" where the speed of subsequent action potentials is modulated by prior activity. We utilized microneurography data from 95 mechano-insensitive C-fibers of healthy human participants, including both sexes, across various stimulation protocols to optimize model parameters. The model incorporates linear long-term and non-linear short-term memory components. By convolving the history of recorded action potentials with the memory function, the model can effectively predict the propagation speed of subsequent action potentials with low mean squared errors for the proposed one-dimensional and two-dimensional memory functions. This computational framework provides insights into the dynamics of unmyelinated axons under varying conditions and thus in signal processing along the axon and the short-term memory of axons. The model's rapid computation times make it suitable for real-time applications in electrophysiological experiments.",

    "title": "A lightweight, physics-based, sensor-fusion filter for real-time EEGdenoising and improved downstream AI classification",
    "content": "Physiological time-series data, like electroencephalography (EEG), are vulnerable to motion, ocular, and muscle artifacts that hinder real-time inference and bias offline analyses. We present the Minds AI Filter: a lightweight, physics-based, sensor-fusion method that exploits multichannel spatial structure and band-aware synchrony to enhance neural activity while suppressing non- neural noise. The nomenclature \"AI\" reflects integration within a larger artificial-intelligence pipeline; the filter itself requires no prior training or deep learning. A single tuning parameter controls filter strength. The design supports streaming windows (approx. 1s) with minimal added latency and extends naturally to longer offline segments; leveraging a sensor-fusion design across channels, it suggests applicability to other neurophysiological time-series, such as MEG and ECoG, pending further validation; exploratory incorporation of EOG/ECG as auxiliary signals is a potential avenue for future filter advancements. We evaluate the approach across multiple devices and public datasets, assessing both down- stream AI classification performance and real-time signal-quality metrics. In both real-time and offline settings, the filter performed better on dynamic artifacts and noise than baseline and commonly used alternatives in our evaluations. When applied in conjunction with other methods, it was only observed to improve downstream accuracy, never reduce it, when any effect was present. Denoising is quantified using SNR-like measures, and ablations isolate the roles of spatial coupling and band weighting. Artifact-specific analyses (ocular bursts, head tilt, jaw clench) and latency profiling on commodity hardware are included. These results indicate that a lightweight, synchrony-aware filter can robustly stabilize real-time EEG and systematically improve downstream AI classification. The method is compatible with standard preprocessing but does not depend on it.",

    "title": "Predictive gaze orienting during navigation in virtual reality",
    "content": "Natural vision is an active, predictive process guided by expectations about when and where information will appear. Yet how gaze is shaped in dynamic, multisensory environments remains poorly understood. Using immersive virtual reality with eye-tracking, we examined oculomotor behavior during naturalistic navigation. Participants cycled through a virtual city while avatar cyclists, first heard as overtaking them from behind via spatialized auditory cues, later became visible as they passed. Auditory cues triggered anticipatory gaze shifts to expected locations, indicating that eye movements were guided by auditory predictions rather than reactive visual responses. Violations of auditory-spatial expectations elicited longer fixations. Critically, removing auditory cues impaired predictive gaze orienting, delayed gaze orienting and increased collisions with obstacles. These findings demonstrate that auditory input fundamentally shapes predictive models guiding visual exploration and adaptive behavior in dynamic environments, underscoring the multisensory basis of active perception in real-world interactions.",

    "title": "Amphisome biogenesis couples synaptic autophagy to local protein synthesis",
    "content": "Summary Amphisomes are hybrid organelles that result from fusion of late endosomes with autophagosomes. Here, we report that amphisomes containing BDNF/TrkB and capable of signaling are formed at presynaptic boutons following high-frequency stimulation. Activity dependent bulk-endocytosis serves as a membrane source and autophagy initiation is induced by the energy-sensing enzyme AMPK. Intense neuronal transmission not only induces high membrane exchange and metabolic demands, but it also causes the remodeling of presynaptic molecular composition. We show that formation of BDNF/TrkB signaling amphisomes contribute to the fast turnover of key presynaptic proteins that constitute the synaptic vesicle cluster. Following sustained synaptic activity newly-formed amphisomes enable their degradation as cargo on the one hand and their replenishment by translation of mRNA localized at synaptic boutons on the other. We propose that activity-induced synaptic autophagy to a large degree represents amphisome formation that in turn is required to replace cytomatrix proteins at presynaptic sites.",

    "title": "Development of a Human iPSC-Derived \"Corticospinal Tract-on-a-Chip\" for Neurodegenerative Disease Research",
    "content": "Degeneration of the corticospinal tract is a central feature in a number of neurodegenerative disorders and leads to significant disability. However, modeling corticospinal neuron (CSN) pathology and corticospinal connectivity in neurological disorders is particularly challenging. While rodent models are important for understanding early degeneration of CSN, interspecies differences in corticospinal connectivity and challenges of in vivo study suggest that human in vitro models of corticospinal biology may be ripe for development. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are promising tools for overcoming intrinsic limitations that arise from physiological differences between rodents and humans. We have developed an innovative hiPSC-based microfluidic platform for modeling human CSN and spinal motor neuron (SpMN) connectivity. The incorporation of regionally specific astrocyte subtypes (cortical and spinal) in addition to CSNs and SpMNs in this newly designed system allows for the modeling of both regional and neural cell-subtype interactions. Using this model, multielectrode array electrophysiology reveals the maturation of both cortical and spinal motor neurons over the time course of 12 weeks. Retrograde labeling methods demonstrate synaptic connectivity between corticospinal and spinal motor neurons. Optogenetic strategies to selectively activate excitatory CNs attenuated by glutamate receptor antagonism confirms the functional relevance of the model. Incorporating morphological, electrophysiological and physiological measures of corticospinal connectivity, this platform is a versatile model for use in neurodegenerative disease research and for the future development of targeted CSN therapies.",

    "title": "Neurodegeneration Associated with Repeated High-Frequency Transcranial Focused Ultrasound",
    "content": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (tFUS) is a popular tool for non-invasive neuromodulation which prior testing paradigms have suggested is benign. However, emerging use cases such as clinical therapies and brain-machine interfaces will likely require repeated or long-duration exposures with novel combinations of stimulus parameters (e.g., frequency, focal volume), and the safety of these conditions has not yet been rigorously validated. Therefore, as an initial study we delivered 1.8 MHz tFUS stimulation to the cortex of 4 non-human primates in 4 sessions each of approximately 90 min over 2 weeks. Motor skills were measured daily with a food pellet picking task. Animals were euthanized and the brain sections were processed for histological markers of neurodegeneration (Fluoro-Jade C). While the animals did not show disruption on the behavioral task, there was clear evidence of neurodegeneration in regions associated with short, intermediate, and extended-duration stimulation, but not with unstimulated control tissues in deeper brain areas. Additional neurodegeneration was observed at locations distant from but functionally connected to stimulated regions, consistent with retrograde damage propagated from neuron processes. We discuss alternative causes for the neurodegeneration, and we recommend the use of additional animal studies to understand this phenomenon, especially for novel stimulation paradigms or parameters and applications where extended or repeated exposures are planned.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "title": "Effects of AC induced electric fields on neuronal firing sensitivity and activity patterns",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "content": "Mouse models are an essential tool for understanding behavior and disease states in neuroscience research. While genetic and sex-specific effects have been reported in many neurodegenerative and psychiatric illnesses, these factors may also alter baseline neuroanatomical features of mice. This raises the question of whether the observed changes are related to the disease being studied (i.e., pathological differences) or if there are baseline strain or sex differences that may potentially predispose animals to different responses. Over the past decade, tremendous effort has been made in mapping neural architecture at various scales; however, the complex relationships including identifying genetic and sex-specific differences in brain structure and function remain understudied. To bridge this gap, we used C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, two of the most widely used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience research, to investigate strain and sex-specific features of the brain connectome in awake animals using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By combining resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI, we found that the motor, sensory, limbic, and salience networks exhibit significant differences in both functional and structural domains between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Further, functional and structural properties of the brain were significantly correlated in both strains. Our results underscore the importance of considering these baseline differences when interpreting the brain-behavior interactions in mouse models of human disorders.",

    "content": "Glaucoma disrupts the conveyance of retinal signals to visual regions of the brain such as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Although plasticity during development allows altered visual experience to modulate dLGN synapses and excitability, evidence for experience-dependent dLGN plasticity in adults is limited. However, glaucoma might trigger compensatory plasticity in adult dLGN, thereby compensating for diminished RGC synaptic drive. Here, we tested this using aged (11-15 month-old) DBA/2J mice, which develop high intraocular pressure and glaucoma. In brain slice recordings, we found that diminished RGC inputs could drive robust action potential firing in dLGN relay neurons that was comparable to controls. This was accompanied by increased intrinsic excitability and decreased magnitude of sustained inhibitory currents from GABA spillover to extrasynaptic receptors. These results implicate multiple cellular and synaptic mechanisms that support signaling despite the diminished RGC inputs in glaucoma.",

    "content": "Zebrafish are a powerful model for imaging studies of development and neurobiology. However, most studies have focused on developing zebrafish due to technical and biological challenges of imaging adult stages. These include increased tissue opacity and illumination depth limitations, and difficulty maintaining life support and anesthesia in a 2-4cm long fish. There are currently limited tools for intravital imaging of the adult zebrafish brain. The ability to image the brain in the same individual repeatedly without physical damage would allow zebrafish to be better utilized to study aging and neurodegenerative disease. We designed and applied a 3D-printable device for non-invasive, repeatable multiphoton neural imaging of genetically non-pigmented adult zebrafish from 2 months to 2 years old. Animals successfully recovered after multi-hour imaging sessions and could be imaged repeatedly over periods of weeks to years. We show the utility of this approach through imaging the neuroimmune system, revealing that microglia in aged zebrafish have enhanced cellular dynamics. This technique could be widely used and beneficial for other cell-scale neuroimaging studies in the adult fish.",

    "title": "Deciphering the circular RNAs landscape in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
    "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons, with most cases lacking a clear genetic basis. Emerging evidence highlights the involvement of non-coding RNAs, particularly circular RNAs (circRNAs), in disease onset and progression. In this study, we investigated circRNAs implicated in ALS and related motor neuron diseases (MNDs). First, we conducted a systematic review to identify ALS-associated circRNAs, followed by in silico analyses of 15 selected candidates. Our results revealed that hsa-circ-0000099, hsa-circ-0001017, hsa-circ-004846, and hsa-circ-0034880 regulate a high number of ALS-related genes through miRNA sponging. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that hsa-circ-0000099 is particularly involved in unfolded protein response, oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. Protein-RNA interaction analysis further showed that ALS-related circRNAs can sponge 20 RNA-binding proteins, with FMR1, ELAVL1, EIF4A3, and SRSF1 exhibiting the highest number of interactions. Additionally, molecular docking analysis demonstrated that FUS mutations significantly alter its binding affinity to hsa-circ-0000567 and hsa-circ-0060762. RNA-seq data from ALS patients confirmed significant alterations in the expression of host genes of ALS-related circRNAs and hub proteins across affected tissues, including the spinal cord and multiple brain regions. Collectively, these findings support circRNAs as active contributors to ALS pathogenesis. In particular, the host gene of hsa-circ-0000099, which is expressed in the spinal cord and hippocampus, emerges as a potential biomarker for tissue-specific impairment in ALS. Moreover, its regulatory role in key ALS-related cellular pathways underscores its promise as a candidate for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm its role in ALS pathology.",

    "title": "Convergent and divergent neural and behavioral responses to chronic cocaine use in macaques",
    "content": "Chronic cocaine use leads to physical dependence, psychological addiction, and various health problems such as cardiovascular issues and cognitive impairments. This condition continues to be extremely difficult to treat, as we grapple with its neural and behavioral complexities. What we are missing is a comprehensive account on how naive brains react to occasional and chronic cocaine use, abstinence and re-exposure within subject. We tracked naive macaques using precision functional mapping before, during and after chronic cocaine self-administration over a period of nine months. We analyzed the entire brain to illustrate the pervasive impact of chronic cocaine use on overall function. Although we set out to map the addiction connectome, we found that the neural correlates of chronic drug use and recovery are more complex that can be captured by a singular, canonical connectome. We provide a preclinical model that maps the progression of the macaque functional connectome from a naive state through chronic cocaine use, recovery and re-exposure. We demonstrate that the addiction connectome is dynamic and is characterized by the interaction of subject by drug by time. Occasional cocaine use, whether initial or re-exposure, overrides individual differences, leading to a strong homogenous effect across subjects, or convergence. However, the brain's response to prolonged cocaine use becomes more individualized, resulting in the divergence of effects across subjects. This can be explained by heterogeneity in cocaine-induced effects and in their associated timescales. Abstinence-induced neural alterations converged across subjects after 1-month, but by 2 months, individual trajectories revealed heterogeneity, possibly indicating differences in recovery.",

    "title": "Gain-controlled reconfiguration of long-range coupling explains visibility-dependent spatiotemporal neural coding dynamics",
    "content": "Numerous studies demonstrate the widespread cortical engagement in conscious and unconscious processing (1-5), yet the mechanistic principle that reorganizes spatiotemporal neural dynamics across different levels of conscious access remains unclear. We addressed this using a personalized, connectome-constrained large-scale biophysical model of whole-brain source-imaged electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics recorded from participants who reported the orientation of a backward-masked Gabor patch at four levels of visibility. The key control parameter in the model is the global input gain ({gamma}) to physiologically-grounded cell populations, defined operationally such that higher {gamma} denotes weaker effective global input, which reconfigures long-range couplings and thus modulates spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Fitted {gamma} maps showed higher gain in posterior regions and lower gain in frontal regions on visible trials, whereas the pattern was opposite on invisible trials - i.e., posterior regions received weaker and frontal regions stronger input under visibility, with the opposite under invisibility. This inversion of {gamma} map was observed in pyramidal, VIP, and PV populations, while supplementary pyramidal, SST, and PV time constant were invariant. The visibility-dependent reversal in gain topography mirrored the observed spatiotemporal neural coding dynamics - under visibility, early occipital-to-frontal dynamic coding switched to stable coding, whereas in invisible condition, frontal-dominant stable coding emerged early with attenuated dynamic coding. Simulations generated from the fitted parameters reproduced the observed spatiotemporal neural coding dynamics, supporting a gain-control axis - with pyramidal input efficacy as the principal readout and coordinated VIP/PV modulation - that selects between locally integrating and globally broadcasting regimes as visibility changes. Our results provide a bottom-up mechanistic account of differential perceptual processing depending on the degree of the stimulus awareness, offering insights into potentially resolving ongoing debates about theories of consciousness.",

    "title": "Sources of outdoor air pollution exposure and child brain network development across the United States",
    "content": "Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution is a heterogeneous mixture of chemicals with documented neurotoxic effects. Developmental neuroimaging literature has linked childhood PM2.5 exposure to alterations in brain morphology, microarchitecture, and function, with implications for cognition and psychopathology. However, the extant literature remains largely cross-sectional and often considers PM2.5 a single pollutant, rather than a heterogeneous mixture of chemicals from different sources. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging estimates of exposure to six PM2.5 sources derived from positive matrix factorization, and longitudinal neuroimaging data from a large, geographically-diverse sample of Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study youth (N = 6,291) from across the United States (U.S.). To identify exposure-related differences in brain function and assess their geographical generalizability, we used a predictive modeling approach to assess both differences in functional brain network connectivity during childhood (9-11 years of age) and changes in functional brain network connectivity during the transition to adolescence (9-13 years of age) related to PM2.5 exposure. Childhood PM2.5 exposure from traffic emissions and industrial/residual fuel burning were linked to mixed patterns of both stronger and weaker connectivity of sensorimotor networks at ages 9-11 years. Conversely, childhood exposures to secondary pollutants (i.e., ammonium sulfates, nitrates) were linked to largely stronger connectivity of brain networks underlying higher-order cognition that decreased over the following two years. However, these patterns of exposure-related functional connectivity identified in youth across the U.S. better represented youth living in the northeast as compared to youth living in the west. Altogether, this work provides insights into the neurotoxicity of outdoor air pollution exposure in developing sensory and motor systems and potential for biomarkers of eventual psychopathology.",

    "content": "The brain represents magnitudes through the collective activity of neural populations, whose non-monotonic tuning properties determine the nature and precision of the population neural code. Whether and how this code adapts to changes in the statistics of the encoded magnitudes remains unknown. Here we probe the adaptation of the encoding of numbers in human parietal cortex, using functional MRI during a numerosity-estimation task in which we vary the range of possible numbers. Tracking the tuning properties of number-sensitive populations as the range changes, we show that their receptive fields shift and scale in adaptation to the range, following a structured and predictable pattern. This distributed range adaptation implements efficient coding dynamically: the resulting precision of the neural code varies with the range and is accompanied by corresponding changes in behavioral precision. At the participant level, the degree of neural tuning adaptation significantly correlates with the change in behavioral variability. Our results extend static sensory efficient coding to the adaptive representation of abstract magnitudes, via a neural mechanism of distributed range adaptation that may be a canonical property of neural encoding circuits.",

    "title": "Amorphous silicon resistors enable smaller pixels in photovoltaic retinal prosthesis",
    "content": "Objective. Clinical trials of the photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis PRIMA demonstrated feasibility of prosthetic central vision with resolution matching its 100 \u00b5m pixel width. To improve prosthetic acuity further, pixel size should be decreased. However, there are multiple challenges, one of which is related to accommodating a compact shunt resistor within each pixel that discharges the electrodes between stimulation pulses and helps increase the contrast of the electric field pattern. Unfortunately, standard materials used in integrated circuit resistors do not match the resistivity required for small photovoltaic pixels. Therefore, we used a novel material\u2014doped amorphous silicon (a-Si) and integrated it into photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes down to 20 \u00b5m. Approach. To fit within a few \u00b5m2 area of the pixels and provide resistance in the M\u03a9 range, the material should have sheet resistance of a few 100 k\u03a9 sq\u22121, which translates to resistivity of a few \u03a9 * cm. The a-Si layer was deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and its resistivity was adjusted by PH3 doping before encapsulating the resistors between SiO2 and SiC for stability in-vivo. Main results. High-resolution retinal implants with integrated shunt resistors were fabricated with values ranging from 0.75 to 4 M\u03a9 on top of the photovoltaic pixels of 55, 40, 30 and 20 \u00b5m in size. Photoresponsivity with all pixel sizes was approximately 0.53 A W\u22121, as high as in the arrays with no shunt resistor. The shunts shortened electrodes discharge time, with the average electric potential in electrolyte decreasing by only 21%\u201331 % when repetition rate increased from 2 to 30 Hz, as opposed to a 54%\u201355 % decrease without a shunt. Similarly, contrast of a Landolt C pattern increased from 16%\u201322 % with no shunt to 22%\u201334 % with a shunt. Further improvement in contrast is expected with pillar electrodes and local returns within each pixel. Significance. Miniature shunt resistors in a M\u03a9 range can be fabricated from doped a-Si in a process compatible with manufacturing of photovoltaic arrays. The shunt resistors improved current injection and spatial contrast at video frame rates, without compromising the photoresponsivity. These advances are critical for scaling pixel sizes below 100\u202f\u00b5m to improve visual acuity of prosthetic vision.",

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

Despite phenotypic rescue in animal deletion models, clinical trials in humans have been unsuccessful, likely due to the heterogeneous nature of FXS. To uncover the basis of individual- and subgroup-level variation driving treatment failures, we propose to test and modulate thalamocortical drive as a novel...",
