    "title": "Slow change blindness from serial dependence",
    "content": "Slow change blindness, when attentive observers fail to notice large changes that happen gradually, raises questions about how visual information is combined across time. One plausible integration strategy is serial dependence: blending information from the recent past into current perception. Here, we investigate serial dependencies in perception of a cartoon object that slowly changes hue. In a one-shot experiment, observers each viewed a single trial with a random degree of hue change and provided one hue judgement response. Across participants, the entire morph was probed. Observers' hue reports revealed an overall bias towards the past that increased in magnitude as more of the morph was experienced. In three follow-up experiments, we verified that observers experienced slow change blindness, confirmed that the bias was serial dependence, and replicated the results with a repeated-trials design. Overall, we provide evidence that serial dependence actively biases perception during gradual changes, producing slow change blindness.",

    "title": "Circulating Lipids are Associated with PTSD Severity and Predict Symptomatic PTSD in a Cohort of Veterans and Service Members",
    "content": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by chronic stress, alterations in mood, and avoidance after a traumatic event has occurred. While recovery can occur, many PTSD patients suffer life-long impairments. In combat veterans, high rates of PTSD contribute to increased rates of depression and anxiety and a higher likelihood of suicidal ideation. The lack of biological markers for psychiatric conditions such as PTSD highlights the need for omics-based approaches to diagnosis. Discovery of novel blood-based biomarkers could aid in the development of treatments or therapies, quantify groups for those at the highest risk of adverse events, and provide insight into the molecular underpinnings of PTSD. This study used untargeted lipidomics to analyze 602 circulating lipid species in blood from a cohort of 133 veterans and combat members with varying severities of PTSD. We discovered five circulating lipids, including serum total cholesterol, cholesterol ether (ChE(18:2)), and lipids associated with metabolic dysfunction (CL(87:7), MLCL(50:4), PE(18:1e_20:3)) that correlated significantly with increasing PTSD severity after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Additionally, we showed that symptomatic PTSD patients could be separated from asymptomatic controls using these lipid species. This study contributes to the limited research surrounding the role of circulating lipids in PTSD.",

Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems.

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "title": "When embodiment matters most: a confirmatory study on VR priming in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces training",
    "content": "BackgroundVirtual Reality (VR) feedback is increasingly integrated into Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, enhancing the Sense of Embodiment (SoE) toward virtual avatars and fostering more vivid motor imagery (MI). VR-based MI-BCIs hold promise for motor rehabilitation, but their effectiveness depends on neurofeedback quality. Although SoE may enhance MI training, its role as a priming strategy prior to VR-BCI has not been systematically examined, as prior work assessed embodiment only after interaction. This study investigates whether embodiment priming influences MI-BCI outcomes, focusing on event-related desynchronization (ERD) and BCI performance.MethodsUsing a within-subject design, we combined data from a pilot study with an extended experiment, yielding 39 participants. Each completed an embodiment induction phase followed by MI training with EEG recordings. ERD and lateralization indices were analyzed across conditions to test the effect of prior embodiment.ResultsEmbodiment induction reliably increased SoE, yet no significant ERD differences were found between embodied and control conditions. However, lateralization indices showed greater variability in the embodied condition, suggesting individual differences in integrating embodied feedback.ConclusionOverall, findings indicate that real-time VR-based feedback during training, rather than prior embodiment, is the main driver of MI-BCI performance improvements. These results corroborate earlier findings that real-time rendering of embodied feedback during MI-BCI training constitutes the primary mechanism supporting performance gains, while highlighting the complex role of embodiment in VR-based MI-BCIs.",

    "title": "Precision TMS through the integration of neuroimaging and machine learning: optimizing stimulation targets for personalized treatment",
    "content": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique based on electromagnetic induction, modulates cortical excitability by inducing currents with a magnetic field. TMS has demonstrated significant clinical potential in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, conventional TMS targeting methods that rely on anatomical landmarks do not adequately account for individual differences in brain structure and functional networks, leading to considerable variability in treatment responses. In recent years, advances in neuroimaging techniques\u2013such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)\u2013together with the application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in big data analysis, have provided novel approaches for precise TMS targeting and individualized treatment. This review summarizes the latest developments in the integration of multimodal neuroimaging and AI technologies for precision neuromodulation with TMS. It focuses on critical issues such as imaging resolution, AI model generalizability, real-time feedback modulation, as well as data privacy and ethical considerations. Future prospects including closed-loop TMS control systems, cross-modal data fusion, and AI-assisted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are also discussed. Overall, AI-driven personalized TMS strategies hold promise for markedly enhancing treatment precision and clinical efficacy, thereby offering new theoretical and practical guidance for individualized treatment in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "title": "Systematic review of experimental studies in humans on transcranial temporal interference stimulation",
    "content": "Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation method aimed at reaching deeper brain regions than conventional techniques. However, many questions about its effects remain, requiring further experimental studies. This review consolidates the experimental literature on tTIS\u2019s effects in the human brain, clarifies existing evidence, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes future research directions to evaluate its potential. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published up to 27 January 2025. Eligible studies applied tTIS to the human brain and examined its effects on neural, behavioral, and clinical outcomes. Of 127 publications screened, 18 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were analyzed for design, stimulation target, parameters, control conditions, and outcome measures. Included studies exhibited low bias or minor concerns using the Cochrane RoB2 and ROBINS-I tools. Ten studies targeted cortical regions (motor, occipito-parietal, fronto-parietal), and eight probed subcortical sites (striatum, hippocampus, globus pallidus, caudate). Motor-cortex tTIS enhanced motor-network connectivity, though the effect was similar to that of transcranial direct current stimulation. Beta-band stimulation envelopes (20\u2009Hz) promoted learning-related plasticity, while gamma-band envelopes (70\u2009Hz) yielded immediate performance improvements. Occipito-parietal tTIS did not modulate alpha power. Preliminary deep-target findings are promising: 5 Hz hippocampal tTIS improved episodic recall, 100\u2009Hz striatal tTIS enhanced motor learning in older adults, and 100\u2009Hz hippocampal-entorhinal tTIS aided spatial navigation. Two fMRI studies confirmed network-specific modulation, although one raised concerns about using a fixed montage between individuals. Clinical evidence remains limited, with two Parkinson\u2019s pilots and one epilepsy study showing short-term benefits. Overall, tTIS shows potential to modulate human brain activity and behavior. However, current evidence is preliminary and predominantly focused on cortical rather than deep targets. Larger, well-controlled studies are needed to reliably determine whether tTIS can effectively engage subcortical structures and provide meaningful clinical benefits.",

    "content": "Objective. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) scan contains a muscle\u2019s detailed stimulus-activation information and thereby can be used for motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Due to the challenges in accurately obtaining the motor unit numbers from experimental CMAP scans, most existing MUNE methods rely on data fitting, which is time-consuming and requires manual operations. This study explored the feasibility of a neural network-based MUNE approach and proposes an end-to-end model for rapid estimation. Approach. We developed NNEstimation, a novel supervised learning framework based on a convolutional neural network, to estimate motor unit numbers from both synthetic and experimental CMAP scans. A probabilistic model with varied parameters was used to generate CMAP scans with diverse characteristics for neural network training. NNEstimation trained on synthetic data was directly tested on both synthetic and experimental data. Main results. Evaluations on synthetic CMAP scans demonstrate that NNEstimation achieves lower estimation error and shorter execution time than the conventional data fitting method, MScanFit. The accuracy of NNEstimation is influenced by motor unit numbers of CMAP scans and remains unaffected by noise levels, recorded amplitudes, or motor unit activation thresholds. Moreover, NNEstimation\u2019s estimates on experimental data are highly consistent with those of MScanFit. Significance. Although trained solely on synthetic CMAP scans, NNEstimation achieves estimation results comparable to those of the traditional algorithm on experimental data while significantly reducing execution time, demonstrating its potential for practical MUNE applications.",

    "title": "Feature fusion based on global-local weighted attention model for automatic epileptic seizure detection",
    "content": "Objective. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which present significant challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Despite advances in seizure detection, existing methods often struggle with accurately capturing the complex and dynamic interactions between temporal, spatial, and spectral features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This leads to limitations in the detection accuracy and generalization across different datasets. Approach. To address these challenges, we propose global-local weighted attention (GLWA) model, which integrates temporal, spatial, and spectral features through a local-global attention mechanism. At the same time, GLWA effectively balances both global and local features, capturing comprehensive information from EEG signals to enhance seizure detection accuracy. Main results. Our proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 98.82% and 98.89% on the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the model\u2019s capability to effectively integrate these features, resulting in improved detection performance. Significance. Furthermore, we visualize the model\u2019s decision-making process to gain insights into the attention distribution across different brain regions and spectraluency bands, further emphasizing GLWA\u2019s potential in seizure detection. This work demonstrates the model\u2019s superior performance and interpretability, providing a robust approach for accurate and generalizable identification of seizures.",

    "title": "From zero- to few-shot: deep temporal learning of wrist EMG enables scalable cross-user gesture recognition",
    "content": "Objective. Wrist electromyography (EMG) is emerging as an enticing wearable input modality for human\u2013machine interaction. Traditionally recorded from the forearm for use in transradial prostheses, wrist-based EMG sensors are now being integrated into devices such as watches and wristbands for hand gesture recognition (HGR). Consumer familiarity with wrist-worn devices makes wrist EMG a compelling option, but the need for individualized user calibration remains a challenge. Approach. This study therefore evaluated various cross-user models to reduce the calibration burden and compared wrist- and forearm-based models. Eight different machine learning architectures were evaluated across 33 users, using varying amounts of data from the end user. Main results. A temporal convolutional network-bidirectional long short-term memory architecture, applied for the first time to EMG classification, was found to significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) outperform other tested machine learning architectures. An inter-day feature set combined with Z-score normalization achieved the best performance when classifying five gestures (plus a rest class) using either wrist or forearm EMG. Consistent with other recent results, wrist EMG consistently outperformed forearm EMG in all analyses, including within- and across-user comparisons (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In cross-user models, wrist EMG demonstrated a zero-shot performance of 78.2%, compared to 71.6% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Introducing one calibration repetition from the end user increased one-shot performance of wrist EMG to 91.6%, compared to 86.9% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Adding further training repetitions boosted wrist EMG performance to 98.3%, compared to 97.4% for forearm EMG. Significance. These findings provide new evidence supporting the viability of wrist EMG for cross-user HGR models that generalize to new users with minimal calibration, suggesting promising potential for its broader adoption in wearable devices.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "Adaptive cognition relies on brain activity that is both flexible and resilient to noise, a property we term functional inertia. Conventional dynamic fMRI metrics treat networks as memoryless and cannot capture the persistence that makes some states fleeting and others entrenched. We introduce the functional inertia index (FII), the first index to quantify temporal momentum by measuring the force required to deviate from a brain's long-running trajectory. Applied to resting-state fMRI from a multisite schizophrenia cohort, FII revealed distinct recurrent states, with prolonged residence in a high-inertia plateau predicting greater symptom severity. This effect was mediated by whole-brain FII, which also showed a positive relationship with cognition in patients but a negative relationship in controls, revealing a dissociation between adaptive and maladaptive rigidity. At the regional level, FII unifies two long-standing observations in schizophrenia: excessive rigidity in associative hubs and pathological volatility in sensory pathways, situating both within a single inertial framework and offering a candidate dynamic biomarker.",

Since real-world studies of this kind would pose ethical and safety risks, we employed virtual reality (VR) to simulate an accident scenario. In the scenario, the driver approaches a fork in the road, knowing that one path would lead off a cliff crashing the car fatally-as the fork comes closer, the other, safe, path is suddenly blocked...",

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38).

    "content": "There are different perspectives on the psychological constructs of resilience and hypnotizability, and both are related to aspects of mental health. Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

    "content": "Acceptance can improve psychological functioning. However, research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy of acceptance, which may be related to instructions to accept different aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., thoughts vs. emotion). We compared the effects of self-regulation instructions to accept thoughts, emotions, or a combination of both on measures of affect (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, state anxiety) and emotional dysregulation immediately following emotion-eliciting film clips and following recovery periods after film clips. We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip. Implications of findings and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "When beliefs in autobiographical memories are reduced while recollections remain relatively intact, a phenomenon termed nonbelieved memories (NBMs) unfolds. The current preregistered study (<em>N</em> = 104) used a 3-week longitudinal design to investigate the relationships between the frequency of recalled NBMs, memory distrust, rumination over autobiographical events, and self-esteem. Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Dissociation is a phenomenon present in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders as well as in the general population. The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "title": "Dithering suppresses half-harmonic neural synchronisation to photic stimulation in humans",
    "content": "While entraining neural rhythms using brain stimulation has been suggested as a therapeutic mechanism to normalise brain activity in conditions such as depression, chronic pain, or Alzheimer's disease, periodic stimulation can also inadvertently entrain brain rhythms at sub- and superharmonics of the stimulation frequency, which could lead to deleterious effects. Slightly jittering stimulation pulses (called \"dithering\") was previously proposed on the basis of mathematical modelling to selectively entrain a target neural rhythm while avoiding harmonic entrainment. In this study, we investigated the potential of dithering in humans. Using photic stimulation (light flicker) and EEG recordings in healthy participants, we showed that dithering suppresses half-harmonic synchronisation relative to perfectly periodic flicker, and more so than synchronisation at the stimulation frequency. This was also the case for a periodic condition with reduced stimulation amplitude, as predicted by theory. Furthermore, we demonstrated using synthetic data and modelling that the half-harmonic responses observed in participants cannot be explained by the superposition of evoked responses (even when modulated at the half-harmonic frequency), and are better matched by a minimal oscillator model. Our findings are consistent with half-harmonic EEG synchronisation in response to photic stimulation predominantly reflecting half-harmonic entrainment rather than the summation of evoked responses, and with dithering being an effective strategy to suppress subharmonic entrainment.",

    "content": "IntroductionWhile lesion and neurophysiological animal studies point toward a notable involvement of subcortical pathways in the control of low back muscles, little attention has been dedicated to the subject in humans. The StartReact paradigm may allow to indirectly test the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system during motor control, thus addressing this gap of knowledge. In this study, we aimed to compare the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system in the control of low back muscles during voluntary (lumbar spine extension) and postural (upper limb movement eliciting anticipatory postural adjustment) tasks using the StartReact paradigm.MethodsThe reaction time (RT) of the lumbar erector spinae was measured within a simple precued RT task while conditioned by startling (SAS\u2014116\u202fdB) or non-startling (NSAS\u201480\u202fdB) acoustic stimuli.ResultsThe reduction in RT was similar during the postural and voluntary tasks. However, RT was more shortened with the SAS condition compared to the NSAS condition in both tasks. This finding was replicated using a cumulative distribution functions analysis.DiscussionFor the first time, a StartReact effect of back muscles was demonstrated during a voluntary task and was shown to be similar to that observed in a postural task. Therefore, these results suggest a contribution of the reticulospinal tract in the postural and voluntary control of back muscles in humans.",

    "title": "Association between neuroticism and physical activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysical activity has been shown to be associated with neuroticism, a personality trait reflecting emotional instability and a tendency toward negative emotions. Understanding this relationship is crucial for developing effective mental health interventions. However, the underlying mechanisms and the strength of this association remain insufficiently understood.ObjectiveThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the current research on the relationship between neuroticism and physical activity, analyze their correlations and moderating factors, and investigate the potential bidirectional mechanisms linking these two factors.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost for studies published between January 2000 and November 2024. We included English-language studies across all age groups that employed cross-sectional, longitudinal, or cohort designs. Studies focusing on special populations, non-peer-reviewed works, samples with fewer than 50 participants, non-empirical studies, and reviews were excluded. Data extraction was performed using standardized forms, and a meta-analysis was conducted in Stata 18 to assess heterogeneity and publication bias.ResultsAfter screening, 25 studies were included, comprising 15 Pearson correlation analyses and 12 multiple regression analyses. The meta-analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between physical activity and neuroticism, with an average correlation coefficient r = \u22120.141. This suggests that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower levels of neuroticism. Specifically, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for neuroticism inhibiting physical activity was \u22120.150, indicating that for every one standard deviation increase in neuroticism, physical activity decreases by approximately 0.150 standard deviation units. Conversely, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for physical activity affecting neuroticism was \u22120.113, suggesting a potential reduction in neuroticism with increased physical activity, although this effect was not statistically significant across the limited number of studies.ConclusionOur findings confirm a significant negative association between physical activity and neuroticism, highlighting the potential of physical activity as a strategy for improving mental health. However, establishing causality requires further verification through longitudinal and experimental designs. The results emphasize the need for personalized interventions targeting individuals with high neuroticism. Future research should prioritize diverse cultural samples, standardized measurement protocols, and mechanistic investigations of this bidirectional relationship to better understand the underlying processes and develop effective interventions.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251051360, identifier: CRD420251051360.",

It uniquely illustrates how stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) played a significant role in the presurgical evaluation of a multifocal epileptic disorder which, despite a long history of no changes on MRI, was ultimately found to be associated with bilateral hippocampal sclerosis. This is one of the first documented cases of SEEG application in Kazakhstan, where the method was introduced in 2024.Clinical presentation and diagnostic findingsThe patient suffered from debilitating seizures (4\u20136 times/week, often in series of 3-4/day) refractory to combined antiepileptic therapy. Scalp EEG revealed the first originating from the right frontotemporal leads with subsequent diffuse, predominantly right-sided, propagation. The second seizure, however, showed onset from the left temporal leads; notably, only left-onset seizures culminated in bilateral synchronization. Financial constraints precluding PET-CT and the diagnostic ambiguity of routine methods necessitated invasive SEEG.SEEG results and therapeutic strategySEEG monitoring unequivocally identified three independent epileptogenic foci: in the right hippocampus, left hippocampus, and left orbitofrontal region. Such multifocal pathology significantly reduces the likelihood of successful focal resection. Despite this inherent complexity, a crucial clinical outcome was achieved: the patient has remained completely seizure-free for 7\u202fmonths following the ANT-DBS procedure.ConclusionThis report underscores the critical role of SEEG in the precise localization and characterization of complex, multifocal epileptogenic networks, often elusive to non-invasive modalities. It convincingly demonstrates that a comprehensive invasive approach can lead to successful seizure control even in cases previously considered inoperable. It also reflects the challenges and advancements in developing high-tech epileptological care in regions where advanced methods like SEEG have only recently been introduced.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

    "content": "Objective: Developmental dyslexia (DD) has been related to deficits in multiple cognitive skills. Phonological processing deficits are the most frequently reported in opaque orthographies, but there are few studies of transparent orthographies, such as Spanish. The aim of this study was to comprehensively explore possible deficiencies in cognitive functions in Spanish-speaking Mexican children with DD, to determine whether these deficits can explain problems with decoding fluency and accuracy, and analyze whether they provide support for some of the explanatory hypotheses of DD. Method: An extensive cognitive assessment was performed with Spanish-speaking readers: 40 children (20 girls) with DD (mean age 9.02 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.49) and 40 children (20 girls) who were typical readers (mean age 9.22 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.45). Results: Our results showed that most of the children with DD presented deficits in multiple cognitive skills, although not all of these skills contributed to reading performance. These cognitive deficits were not equally distributed among all children and there was no cognitive skill in which all participants with DD showed poor performance. Our results demonstrated that recognition of letter orientation, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming were significant predictors of reading ability. Conclusion: These findings support the idea that reading is a multifactorial process involving many cognitive skills, and its disruption could arise from different causes. The main findings are discussed in relation to the major explanatory hypotheses of DD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic condition with implications on cognitive functions such as decision-making and impulse control. Intertemporal choice paradigms, measuring temporal discounting, offer insight into decision-making of addictive behaviors. When coupled with mouse kinematics, they also provide implicit measures of decision dynamics. Here, we employed mouse kinematics to investigate the profile of both explicit and implicit intertemporal decision-making in CUD patients versus healthy controls, and the degree of association with clinical, psychiatric, and neuropsychological measures. Method: We recorded mouse kinematics during an intertemporal choice task in 36 CUD patients and 34 healthy matched controls. Before testing, CUD patients underwent a general assessment on a set of addiction-related psychiatric and cognitive domains. Results: In line with previous literature, results revealed higher discount rates in the CUD group. Mouse kinematics was able to discriminate among groups, with CUD patients displaying straighter trajectories for immediate choices and edge-curved ones for future ones. Further, a series of significant correlations have been found between discount rates, kinematic measures and both clinical and psychiatric indices. Conclusions: Overall, these results hold important implications and relevant insights for tailored therapeutic interventions, relapses prediction, and neurobiological classification of addictive disorders.

    "content": "Objective: Individuals with psychotic disorders routinely display anhedonia when rated on clinical interviews that rely on retrospective reports of pleasure; however, hedonic response is intact on laboratory paradigms measuring self-reported in-the-moment (i.e., consummatory) pleasure. It is currently unclear how to reconcile this apparent discrepancy. In the present study, we examined the possibility that clinician-rated anhedonia is associated with impaired memory for positive information across two experiments. Method: In Experiment 1, individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ; <em>n</em> = 28) and healthy controls (CN: <em>n</em> = 21) completed valence and arousal ratings of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral photograph stimuli, followed by an unprompted recognition test after a 1-week delay. In Experiment 2, individuals with SZ (<em>n</em> = 102) and CN (<em>n</em> = 60) completed the Emotional Verbal Learning Test, which assesses memory for word stimuli from happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety conditions over five immediate free-recall trials, short-delay free recall, 20-min long-delay free recall, and long-delay yes/no recognition conditions. Results: Results of Experiment 1 indicated that SZ and CN reported similar levels of valence and arousal to visual stimuli; however, SZ had poorer recognition memory for both pleasant and unpleasant stimuli compared with CN. In Experiment 2, CN demonstrated preferential recall for happiness over sadness, anger, and anxiety stimuli. However, this preferential recall advantage for happiness stimuli was less evident in SZ. Conclusions: Across both studies, reduced recall or recognition for positive stimuli was associated with greater severity of anhedonia. Collectively, findings from these two experiments suggest that clinical ratings of anhedonia are associated with memory deficits for positive stimuli in SZ.

    "content": "Objective: Earlier research on fatigue in post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) has mainly studied subjective fatigue, either over a prolonged period (trait fatigue) or in relation to a certain situation (state fatigue) in the form of perceived fatigability. Another aspect of state fatigue, cognitive performance fatigability, defined as a decline in performance over time in cognitively demanding tasks, has not been the focus of PCC research. We aimed to examine performance fatigability and the associations between these three fatigue domains. Method: Thirty-four individuals with PCC and 36 controls who recovered from COVID-19 without PCC performed cognitive tests repeated twice during the test session to assess performance fatigability. Self-reports were used to assess perceived fatigability (repeated Visual Analogue Scales) and trait fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory). Results: Analysis of covariance showed significant interactions in two tests measuring processing speed: coding (<em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = .17) and a speed composite score derived from Color\u2013Word Interference Test (<em>p</em> = .031, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = .08), where the controls improved their performance more on the repeated tests compared with the PCC group, indicating performance fatigability in the PCC group. For the PCC group, no correlations were found between fatigue domains (<em>r</em> < 0.34). Conclusions: The PCC group exhibited performance fatigability in measures of processing speed. There were no correlations between fatigue domains, suggesting that the domains might represent separate constructs. The results highlight the need to differentiate between various types of fatigue in research and clinical practice and to assess performance fatigability in addition to using self-reports to obtain a comprehensive understanding of fatigue and fatigability.

    "content": "Objective: Initial findings indicate that semantic memory retrieval of different categories, such as fruits and animals, is variably impacted in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Importantly, theories of embodied cognition propose that these variances may stem from compromised motor processing in PD patients. Indeed, the conceptual representation of the fruits category may involve aspects of manipulability and graspability, which are less relevant for the animals category. We aimed to assess semantic memory retrieval of fruits versus animals category as assessed by semantic fluency (SF) in PD by using the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Marker Initiative database. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 104 healthy controls (HC), 264 patients with sporadic de novo PD (S-PD), and 57 patients with genetic PD (G-PD). Additionally, we carried out explorative analysis concerning possible differences between S-PD and G-PF on SF. Results: We found lower fruits SF performance in PD (S-PD plus G-PD) compared to HC; however, this score could not classify the two groups. Crucially, no difference for the animals class was found. When analyzing separately S-PD and G-PD, we found that fruits SF in S-PD was lower compared to HC and was negatively associated with S-PD diagnosis. Remarkably, no difference for the animals class was found. We did not find significant SF differences in the G-PD. Moreover, SF scores, regardless of the category, were uncorrelated with dopamine integrity measures and motor symptoms scales. Conclusions: The findings reveal distinct patterns of category dissociation in S-PD and G-PD, suggesting a potential link between category dissociation and motor embodiment processes in PD.

Method: The MTCF-RT was administered to 25 amnestic patients with AD and 25 patients with memory deficits due to SIVD (<em>n</em> = 18) or PD (<em>n</em> = 7). Additionally, the recognition trial was administered to 40 neurologically unimpaired individuals. All patients were tested on a brief neuropsychological battery, and their magnetic resonance scans were assessed for medial temporal lobe atrophy. Results: MTCF-RT performance was significantly lower in the group of amnestic patients with AD than in the group of amnestic patients with non-AD disorders, whereas healthy subjects performed significantly better than the two experimental groups. The MTCF-RT allowed identifying amnestic patients with AD with 92% sensitivity and 96% specificity using a cutoff of \u22647.358, showing a higher discriminant power with respect to other long-term memory measures. Finally, MTCF-RT scores showed a high negative correlation with medial temporal lobe atrophy and a positive correlation with other long-term memory measures. Conclusions: MTCF-RT could be a useful tool, as part of a larger neuropsychological battery, for discriminating patients with AD from those with memory deficits due to PD or SIVD.

This analysis tests an algorithm capable of identifying persons adversely impacted by any dementia-related biomarker in this case, amyloidopathy as estimated by positron emission tomography (PET). Method: <em>N</em> = 1,737 subjects of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative were assigned to amyloidopathy-affliction classes. Moderation effects were tested by chi-square difference. Results: 39.3% of subjects with (+) PET results were assigned to the afflicted class. The afflicted subjects had greater dementia severity and higher amyloid burdens. These effects persisted at 36 months. Furthermore, the association between amyloid burden and dementia severity was moderated by affliction class. Afflicted nondemented cases with positive PET findings were more likely to convert to clinical \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d over 48 months, by Cox\u2019s<em> F: F</em>(312, 154) = 1.27, <em>p</em> = .05.

    "content": "Objectives: Alzheimer\u2019s disease progresses through several stages, starting with a preclinical phase characterized by subjective cognitive decline (SCD), where individuals express concerns about their memory despite normal cognitive test results. Recent research has indicated subtle semantic difficulties in SCD, prompting the need for a deeper investigation into cognitive processing during this phase. This study aimed to investigate the cognitive processing of famous and unfamiliar faces in individuals with SCD compared to healthy controls, focusing on semantic memory deficits assessment. Method: Twenty-seven participants with SCD and 26 control participants performed a judgment task involving famous and unfamiliar faces while their eye movements were recorded. Mean fixation times, number of revisitations, and number of fixations were analyzed between the two groups. Results: The SCD group exhibited no significant differences in mean fixation times and in the number of revisited regions between famous and unfamiliar faces, in contrast to the control group, which showed distinct patterns in processing these categories of stimuli. Conclusion: These findings suggest that individuals with SCD process famous faces similarly to unfamiliar faces, indicating a potential weakening of semantic processing in SCD. This may have implications for early detection of cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Show HN: Powerful Visual Programming Language (Book)",
    "content": "<p>Throughout my 30+ software development career, after spending many sleepless nights digging up through enormous codebases to understand logic or fix a bug, I was thinking: \"There must be a better, visual way to represent program rather than text\". However, no usable visual programming language popped up on horizon for the whole duration of 30+ years of my career. Therefore, I decided to take matters in my own hands, creating new visual programming language called \"Pipe\". A book about this language was published recently. The book is available for free on Amazon Kindle and Apple iBooks.<p>Language Pipe has a level of sophistication and power comparable to existing most powerful textual languages and therefore, it has a very high chances to successfully compete with text-based programming. The book provides full and comprehensive language specification. On top of that, the book contains many features and ideas planned for future versions of the language.<p>Pipe implements many novel concepts and unique features. As a result, multiple patent applications have already been filed and pending. The published book contains complete language specification, including graphical notation of all its elements and full API specification for code integration. Pipe has the following features:<p>* General-purpose visual language.<p>* Compact but powerful language.<p>* Complete and detailed language specification.<p>* Practical visual language.<p>* API specification for integration with non-visual languages.<p>* Statically-typed language.<p>* Long-term plans for future versions.<p>* Augmentation of AI code generation.<p>* Language for the next generation of low-code systems.<p>The problem of AI code generation is that it is very difficult to prepare complete and precise input specifications, especially in case of a large project. The solution is generating code only for base-level components easily explainable to AI, completing the rest of application via manual coding. That, however, undermines the goal of leveraging AI to remove the need for human programming. Pipe provides an alternative to textual coding by encapsulating AI-generated components within visual blocks for building the rest of application as graphical workflows via an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. As a next level of Pipe evolution, AI will be generating complete visual workflows directly, making it much easier to understand and modify generated logic.<p>Usage of a general-purpose visual programming language Pipe to connect blocks containing AI-generated code can inspire the next generation of extremely versatile low-code platforms, as AI code generation followed by visual integration of generated components is a very powerful low-code framework. Users will be able to generate new components using AI and that solves the problem of limited customization in existing low-code platforms where components are mostly predefined. On top of that, common visual programming language Pipe will ensure portability of low-code projects between different platforms.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45468145\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45468145</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.01453v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Although birthed in the era of teletypes, the command line shell survived the graphical interface revolution of the 1980's and lives on in modern desktop operating systems. The command line provides access to powerful functionality not otherwise exposed on the computer, but requires users to recall textual syntax and carefully scour documentation. In contrast, graphical interfaces let users organically discover and invoke possible actions through widgets and menus. To better expose the power of the command line, we demonstrate a mechanism for automatically creating graphical interfaces for command line tools by translating their documentation (in the form of man pages) into interface specifications via AI. Using these specifications, our user-facing system, called GUIde, presents the command options to the user graphically. We evaluate the generated interfaces on a corpus of commands to show to what degree GUIde offers thorough graphical interfaces for users' real-world command line tasks.",

Common shapes such as Cartesian planes and flowcharts can be used not only to explain conceptual contributions, but to think through and refine the contribution itself. Yet, theory figures tend to be limited to a set of standard shapes, limiting the creative and expressive potential of visualization theory. In this work, we explore how the shapes used in theory figures afford different understandings and explanations of their underlying phenomena. We speculate on the value of visualizing theories using more expressive configurations, such as icebergs, horseshoes, M\\\"obius strips, and BLT sandwiches. By reflecting on figure-making's generative role in the practice of theorizing, we conclude that theory is, in fact, shapes.",

This work proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.",

    "title": "Non-Invasive Photoacoustic Imaging of Cerebral Oxygenation and Hemoglobin Content in Awake Mice",
    "content": "Introduction: Investigating cerebral oxygen saturation dynamics in awake animal models remains technically challenging due to motion artifacts and anesthesia-related biases. Here, we introduce a novel high-resolution ultrasound-photoacoustic (PA) imaging approach enabling real-time, non-invasive monitoring of deep cerebrovascular oxygenation dynamics in awake mice with intact skulls. Materials and Methods: Swiss male and female mice (n = 5-6) were head-fixed using a customized holder adapted to the Neurotar Mobile HomeCage floating platform. High-resolution ultrasound combined with PA imaging (VevoLAZR-X, VisualSonics) was used to discriminate oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin in multiple brain regions. Cerebrovascular responses were assessed under three paradigms: (i) baseline awake state vs. 2% isoflurane anesthesia, and (ii) right whisker stimulation to probe sensory-driven hemodynamics. Results: PA imaging successfully resolved deep-brain oxygenation in awake, intact-skull mice. Under isoflurane anesthesia, we observed a rapid and transient increase in cerebrovascular sO2; (p < 0.01). During whisker stimulation, we detected robust, region-specific increases in total hemoglobin, reflecting localized neurovascular coupling in awake mice. Conclusions: This study establishes high-resolution PA imaging as a powerful, non-invasive tool to monitor cerebrovascular oxygenation dynamics in awake mice. By integrating baseline, anesthetic, and sensory paradigms, we demonstrate its potential to dissect neurovascular physiology without the confounding effects of anesthesia. These findings provide new opportunities for preclinical neuroscience research and translational applications investigating cerebral oxygen metabolism.",

    "content": "Objective:Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurs later in life in women compared to men. Although previous studies have demonstrated epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) differences in ischemic stroke (IS) patients - a measure of an individual's biological aging -it remains unknown whether this sex dimorphism also applies to ICH patients. Approach and Results: We joined two ICH cohorts (N= 200, 45% women: 76.8{+/-}13 years; 55% men: 67.9{+/-}14 years). DNAm levels were obtained from whole blood samples using Illumina EPIC array. We evaluated three age-predictor clocks (Horvath, Hannum and Zang-BLUP) and one health-status clock (Levine) and their respective EAA metrics including extrinsic EAA (EEAA) and intrinsic EAA (IEAA) measures. We compared aging measures between women and men, then performed an ICH-subtype stratification, a specificity analysis evaluating sex differences in non-stroke samples (N= 350, 54% women 60.8{+/-}8 years, men: 60.8{+/-}10 years) and replication of previous result in a new IS cohort (N= 657, 43% women 73.6{+/-}12 years, men: 70.1{+/-}11 years). Women at time of ICH present lower EAA values than men (Horvath-EAA, p-value=1x10-04; Hannum-EAA, p-value=8.1x10-06; BLUP-EAA, p-value=4.4x10-04) as well as lower extrinsic EAA values (Horvath-IEAA, p-value=3.1x10-03; Hannum-IEAA, p-value=6.5x10-04). These differences seemed to be driven by differences in deep-ICH patients. Non-ICH females have lower acceleration values (Hannum-EAA: -10,37) than non-ICH men (Hannum-EAA: -8,01), but the differences are smaller than in ICH cases (ICH-women Hannum-EAA: -9,26, ICH-men Hannum-EAA: -2,6). This pattern was consistent in the IS cohort, where women were chronologically older than men but had similar biological age and significantly lower epigenetic age acceleration across multiple measures (Horvath-EAA, p = 2.6x10^-3; Hannum-EAA, p = 7.1x10^-3; Horvath-IEAA, p = 1.6x10^-2; Hannum-IEAA, p = 4.5x10^-2). Conclusion:This study shows that biological age difference between women and men are not exclusive of ischemic stroke but also observed in ICH.",

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.01192v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The paper asserts that emulating empathy in human-robot interaction is a key component to achieve satisfying social, trustworthy, and ethical robot interaction with older people. Following comments from older adult study participants, the paper identifies a gap. Despite the acceptance of robot care scenarios, participants expressed the poor quality of the social aspect. Current human-robot designs, to a certain extent, neglect to include empathy as a theorized design pathway. Using rhetorical theory, this paper defines the socio-cultural expectations for convincing empathetic relationships. It analyzes and then summarizes how society understands, values, and negotiates empathic interaction between human companions in discursive exchanges, wherein empathy acts as a societal value system. Using two public research collections on robots, with one geared specifically to gerontechnology for older people, it substantiates the lack of attention to empathy in public materials produced by robot companies. This paper contends that using an empathetic care vocabulary as a design pathway is a productive underlying foundation for designing humanoid social robots that aim to support older people's goals of aging-in-place. It argues that the integration of affective AI into the sociotechnical assemblages of human-socially assistive robot interaction ought to be scrutinized to ensure it is based on genuine cultural values involving empathetic qualities.",

We introduce an open-source, low-cost, precise, non-invasive, and biocompatible jaw tracking system based on optical motion capture technology to address the need for accessible and adaptable research tools. The system encompasses a complete pipeline from data acquisition, processing, and kinematic analysis to filtering, visualization, and data storage. We evaluated its performance and feasibility in experiments with four participants executing various jaw movements. The system demonstrated reliable kinematic tracking with an estimated precision of $(182 \\pm 47) {\\mu}m$ and $(0.126 \\pm 0.034) {\\deg}$. Therefore, the open-source nature of the system and its utility comparable to commercial systems make it suitable for many research and development contexts, especially for applications such as the integration and design of jaw exoskeletons and customized diagnostic protocols. The complete system is available at GitHub with the aim of promoting innovation in temporomandibular disorders research and jaw assistive technology.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.01189v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study investigates a novel approach to eliciting users' moral decision-making by combining immersive roleplaying games with LLM analysis capabilities. Building on the distinction introduced by Floridi between hard ethics inspiring and shaping laws-and soft ethics-moral preferences guiding individual behavior within the free space of decisions compliant to laws-we focus on capturing the latter through contextrich, narrative-driven interactions. Grounded in anthropological methods, the role-playing game exposes participants to ethically charged scenarios in the domain of digital privacy. Data collected during the sessions were interpreted by a customized LLM (\"GPT Anthropologist\"). Evaluation through a cross-validation process shows that both the richness of the data and the interpretive framing significantly enhance the model's ability to predict user behavior. Results show that LLMs can be effectively employed to automate and enhance the understanding of user moral preferences and decision-making process in the early stages of software development.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.01188v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Exploration is crucial in the design process and is known for its essential role in fostering creativity and enhancing design outcomes. Within design teams, exploration evolves into co-exploration, a collaborative and dynamic practice that this study aims to unpack. To investigate this experience, we conducted a longitudinal observational study with 61 students across 16 design teams. Over five months of weekly diary-interviews, we uncovered the intricate dynamics of co-exploration. Our main contribution is a four-dimensional framework that identifies five distinct patterns of co-exploration activities. Our findings reveal how co-exploration emerges across various activities throughout the design process, demonstrating its role in different team interactions. It fosters a sense of togetherness, keeping design teams open-minded and engaged. This engagement cultivates collective intelligence, enabling teams to actively share knowledge, build upon each other's ideas, and achieve outcomes beyond individual contributions. Our study underscores the value of co-exploration, suggesting that it reflects the trajectory of design success and warrants further research. We also provide actionable insights, equipping future practitioners with strategies to enhance co-exploration in design collaborations.",

Visualizing complex problems through animations can significantly enhance learning outcomes. However, the creation of animations can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Hence, many educators illustrate complex concepts by hand on a board or a digital device. Although static graphics are helpful for understanding, they are less effective than animations. The free and open-source Python package Manim enables educators to create visually compelling animations easily. Python's straightforward syntax, combined with Manim's comprehensive set of built-in classes and methods, greatly simplifies implementation. This article presents a series of examples that demonstrate how Manim can be used to create animated video lessons for a variety of topics in computer science and mathematics. In addition, it analyzes viewer feedback collected across multiple social media platforms to evaluate the effectiveness and accessibility of these visualizations. The article further explores broader potentials of the Manim Python library by showcasing demonstrations that extend its applications to subject areas beyond computer science and mathematics.",

    "title": "State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics",
    "content": "arXiv:2502.15440v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting economical computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.02120v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC) extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core, VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.01986v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development. However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.\n  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator with participants exposed to passive driving.\n  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5) compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.\n  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.01858v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning. Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks. This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid compositional meta-learning.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.02182v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations. This leaves open a scientific question: \"how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas, and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces.\" To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information (MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our understanding of its encoding principles.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.01864v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how subjective experience arises from information processing remains a central challenge in neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI research. The Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) proposes a biologically grounded and computationally explicit framework in which consciousness is a discrete sequence of Integrated Informational States (IISs). Each IIS is a packet of integrated information tagged with a multidimensional density vector that quantifies informational richness. Its magnitude correlates with subjective intensity, shaping memory, behavior, and continuity of experience. Inputs from body and environment are adaptively filtered, processed by modules (abstraction, narration, evaluation, self-evaluation), and integrated into an IIS. The resulting packet, tagged with its density vector, is transmitted to behavioral readiness, memory, and decision-making modules, closing the loop. This explains why strongly tagged states exert greater influence on long-term memory and action. Unlike Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory, or Higher-Order Thought, MCT specifies a full computational pipeline producing discrete informational units with quantifiable internal structure. Subjectivity is reframed as a correlate of the density-tagging signal with functional consequences. MCT generates testable predictions, such as stress enhancing memory encoding, and provides a naturalistic blueprint for both biological and artificial architectures. Consciousness, in this view, is not an irreducible essence but an evolvable, quantifiable, and constructible feature of complex information processing.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.01753v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Chronic upper extremity (UE) impairment is common after stroke. This study evaluated Boost, a novel wheelchair-mounted rehabilitation device designed to assist individuals in UE motor recovery during inpatient rehabilitation. Thirty-five stroke inpatients were randomized to perform additional UE exercises alongside standard therapy, using either Boost or a therapist-customized booklet for self-practice. Outcomes included the UE Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) Exam, Box and Block Test, Motor Activity Log, Modified Ashworth Scale, shoulder subluxation, and shoulder pain. At baseline, mean days post-stroke were 11.9$\\pm$4.6 and 13.1$\\pm$5.9, and UEFM scores were 20.5$\\pm$10.1 and 21.0$\\pm$13.5. Intervention durations averaged 11.9$\\pm$4.0 and 17.2$\\pm$8.8 days, respectively. Participants in the Boost group completed 3,359$\\pm$3,137 additional arm movements. No significant between-group differences were found at the three-month follow-up. However, the Boost group showed a trend toward greater UEFM improvement immediately post-intervention (11.8 vs. 6.9 points, p=0.06). Importantly, UEFM gains were predicted by the number of Boost exercises performed (p=0.02, R-square=0.34). Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with less severe impairment (baseline UEFM >21) achieved significantly greater UEFM improvements at discharge with Boost compared to controls (15.8 vs. 7.8 points, p=0.01). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of achieving thousands of additional UE practice movements while seated in a wheelchair without direct supervision during subacute rehabilitation. The added movement practice was well tolerated and may offer short-term impairment-reduction benefits, particularly in those with less severe impairment. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy, establish optimal dosage, and determine long-term clinical and functional benefits of Boost-assisted therapy.",

    "title": "Aligning Video Models with Human Social Judgments via Behavior-Guided Fine-Tuning",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.01502v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity structure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on 250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning shapes video representations toward human social perception.",

The neuronal operational modes that arise with fixed inputs but with varying degrees of stimulation help to elucidate their coding properties. In neurons receiving in vivo stimulation, we show that two operation modes can be described with simplified models: the coincidence detection mode and the integration mode. Our derivations include a simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients betam that captures the subthreshold dynamics of these modes of operation. The resulting model can explain these transitions with the sign and size of the smallest nonlinear coefficient of the polynomial alone. Defining neuronal operational modes provides insight into the processing and transmission of information through electrical currents. Requisite operational modes for proper neuronal functioning may explain disorders involving dysfunction of electrophysiological behavior, such as channelopathies.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.01201v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study investigates how listeners perceive consonance and dissonance in dyads composed of simple (sine) tones, focusing on the effects of frequency ratio ($R$) and mean frequency ($F$). Seventy adult participants - categorized by musical training, gender, and age group - rated randomly ordered dyads using binary preference responses (``like'' or ``dislike''). Dyads represented standard Western intervals but were constructed with sine tones rather than musical notes, preserving interval ratios while varying absolute pitch. Statistical analyses reveal a consistent decrease in preference with increasing mean frequency, regardless of interval class or participant group. Octaves, fifths, fourths, and sixths showed a nearly linear decline in preference with increasing $F$. Major seconds were among the least preferred. Musicians rated octaves and certain consonant intervals more positively than non-musicians, while gender and age groups exhibited different sensitivity to high frequencies. The findings suggest that both interval structure and pitch range shape the perception of consonance in simple-tone dyads, with possible psychoacoustic explanations involving frequency sensitivity and auditory fatigue at higher frequencies.",

The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "content": "ObjectivesNight-shift work is associated with cognitive impairments, but convenient, effective, and acceptable traditional Chinese medicine-based interventions remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of auricular acupressure combined with auricular acupoint massage on cognitive function in night-shift nurses, using P300 wave parameters from electroencephalography analysis as objective metrics.MethodsEighty nurses (40 days-shift, 40 night-shift) participated. The intervention included auricular acupressure and massage targeting six points, performed daily for 4 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). P300 amplitude and latency were measured.ResultsNight-shift nurses had significantly higher ISI scores and lower MoCA attention, memory, and total scores compared to day-shift nurses (all p < 0.05). Before the intervention, After FDR correction for multiple comparisons, P300 amplitude was significantly lower at the T4 electrode site (q = 0.020) in the night-shift group. P300 latency remained significantly prolonged at sites Fz (q = 0.020), F3 (q < 0.001), F4 (q = 0.035), and T5 (q = 0.033). Post-intervention, the night-shift group demonstrated significant increases in P300 amplitude at F3, F4, T3, T4, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05) and significant reductions in P300 latency at Fz, F4, F7, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05). Notably, several sites with affected P300 amplitude and latency before the intervention showed significant improvement following intervention.ConclusionAuricular acupressure and massage significantly improved cognitive function in night-shift nurses, evidenced by enhanced P300 parameters. This non-invasive, cost-effective intervention shows promise for alleviating cognitive impairments from shift work.",

    "title": "The effects of sensory stimulation therapy in patients with sleep disorders: a scoping review",
    "content": "BackgroundSleep disorders are prevalent, affecting 27% of the population and linked to health issues like cognitive impairments and cardiovascular diseases. Current treatments have limitations, prompting interest in sensory stimulation therapy as an alternative approach.ObjectiveThis scoping review aims to explore the effectiveness of sensory stimulation therapy as an intervention for improving sleep disorders, as well as its range of applicability, by synthesizing existing research.MethodsUsing the methodological framework of Arksey and O\u2019Malley and following the PRISMA guidelines, both keywords and free-text searches were conducted. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were then selected from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Wanfang Knowledge Service Platform Database, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. Each article was screened and analyzed according to specific research elements.ResultsA total of 20 randomized controlled trials, involving 1489 participants across 2 types of sensory stimulation therapy, namely multi-sensory and single-sensory stimulations, were included in the study. The main sensory stimuli applied were auditory, visual, olfactory and tactile, while the intervention methods included music therapy, light therapy, aromatherapy and massage therapy. The intervention duration, frequency and cycles varied considerably, but most studies implementing individual sessions lasting 20\u201360 min, at least three sessions per week. Fourteen methods were used to assess sleep quality, and the majority of studies applied two or more assessment methods. Completion rates were also high, with 85%\u2013100% of patients completing over 80% of the intervention protocol. Interestingly, 19 studies reported no adverse events. Overall, sensory stimulation therapy had a positive impact on sleep quality, particularly in aspects such as sleep latency, total sleep time, and subjective sleep experience.ConclusionThe results indicated that sensory stimulation therapy is a safe, feasible and beneficial intervention for improving sleep quality in patients with sleep disorders. However, several limitations were identified in the included studies. Future large-sample, multi-center, high-quality RCTs are needed to further verify the efficacy of this therapy, and provide stronger evidence for their clinical application.Systematic review registrationhttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KQ2XT",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "title": "An Active Insole to Reduce Plantar Pressure Loading: Using Predictive Finite Element Driven Soft Hydraulic Actuators to Minimize Plantar Pressure and the Pressure Time Integral for Diabetic Foot Ulceration Risk Management",
    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "title": "Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs",
    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the effect of enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia (BG-EPVS) on interstitial fluid (ISF) content in white matter and to assess the mediating role of deep medullary vein (DMV) dysfunction in this relationship among patients with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).MethodsMagnetic resonance imaging and clinical data were collected from 166 patients with CSVD. EPVS score (0\u20134) was evaluated on T2-weighted images on the basis of the number of EPVS in a single slice. DMV score (0\u201318) was assigned on susceptibility-weighted imaging according to signal continuity and clarity. Free water (FW) values, representing ISF content in white matter, were derived from diffusion tensor imaging.ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 63.6 \u00b1 11.1 years. The median score was as follows: BG-EPVS, 1 (IQR: 1\u20132); centrum semiovale EPVS (CSO-EPVS), 1 (IQR: 1\u20132); CSVD score, 1 (IQR: 0\u20132), and DMV, 4 (IQR: 1\u201311). The mean FW values were 0.25 \u00b1 0.02. No significant correlation was observed between CSO-EPVS and FW (r = 0.112, p = 0.119). In contrast, BG-EPVS showed a moderate positive correlation with both DMV score (r = 0.594, p < 0.001) and FW (r = 0.521, p < 0.001). DMV score was also moderate positively correlated with FW (r = 0.557, p < 0.001). These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk factors (all p < 0.05). Mediation analysis confirmed that DMV score significantly mediated the relationship between BG-EPVS and FW, independent of covariates.ConclusionHigher BG-EPVS score is significantly associated with increased ISF content in white matter, with DMV dysfunction serving as a key mediator of this association.",

    "content": "The NBEA gene encodes Neurobeachin, a brain-specific kinase-anchoring protein that plays a critical role in vesicle trafficking and synaptic regulation. Pathogenic variants in NBEA are definitively associated with neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by epilepsy, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and myoclonic-astatic epilepsy\u2013like phenotypes. Most reported disease-causing variants are de novo loss-of-function mutations, and although genotype\u2013phenotype correlations remain limited, early-onset generalized seizures are frequently observed. Here, we describe a Chinese child presenting with global developmental delay and recurrent seizures with febrile sensitivity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed no structural abnormalities, while electroencephalography showed epileptiform abnormalities. Genetic analysis identified a de novo nonsense variant in the NBEA gene: c.4715C > A [p.(Ser1572Ter)]. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, the variant was classified as pathogenic. NBEA mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders with or without early-onset epilepsy. Although no additional pathogenic variants were identified in the exome, the influence of other undetected genetic or epigenetic modifiers on the observed phenotype cannot be excluded. This case therefore refines the phenotypic spectrum of NBEA-related disorders, emphasizing that the c.4715C > A [p.(Ser1572Ter)] variant may be associated with developmental impairment and epilepsy with possible febrile sensitivity.",

    "title": "Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy",
    "content": "Objective. The anti-correlation between the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) is a stable characteristic of normal brain activity. However, in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), this anti-correlation is often disrupted and strongly associated with epileptic seizures. This study aims to use periodic spatiotemporal patterns (PSTP) analysis to elucidate the relationship between the DMN-TPN anti-correlation and epileptic activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying IGE. Approach. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyze PSTP in both healthy controls and IGE patients. A pattern-finding algorithm was initially applied to identify repeated spatiotemporal patterns, followed by a novel PSTP-finding algorithm to uncover dynamic periodic patterns through analysis of fluctuations in the DMN-TPN anti-correlation. The Hilbert transform was applied to capture the underlying basic states of these periodic patterns. Additionally, the relationship between period length and intrinsic neural timescales (INT) was explored. Main results. IGE patients exhibited a reduced DMN-TPN anti-correlation, particularly during TPN-dominant states. Additionally, IGE patients exhibited greater dynamic instability in basic states, marked by more frequent transitions between transitional states. Furthermore, lower correlations between period length and INT were observed in cognitive regions of IGE patients. Significance. These findings suggest that dynamic switching between the DMN and TPN in IGE is weaker and less balanced, with disruptions in periodic rhythms linked to cognitive impairments. The proposed PSTP framework provides new insights into the abnormal rhythms of IGE from a spatiotemporal perspective.",

    "title": "Amorphous silicon resistors enable smaller pixels in photovoltaic retinal prosthesis",
    "content": "Objective. Clinical trials of the photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis PRIMA demonstrated feasibility of prosthetic central vision with resolution matching its 100 \u00b5m pixel width. To improve prosthetic acuity further, pixel size should be decreased. However, there are multiple challenges, one of which is related to accommodating a compact shunt resistor within each pixel that discharges the electrodes between stimulation pulses and helps increase the contrast of the electric field pattern. Unfortunately, standard materials used in integrated circuit resistors do not match the resistivity required for small photovoltaic pixels. Therefore, we used a novel material\u2014doped amorphous silicon (a-Si) and integrated it into photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes down to 20 \u00b5m. Approach. To fit within a few \u00b5m2 area of the pixels and provide resistance in the M\u03a9 range, the material should have sheet resistance of a few 100 k\u03a9 sq\u22121, which translates to resistivity of a few \u03a9 * cm. The a-Si layer was deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and its resistivity was adjusted by PH3 doping before encapsulating the resistors between SiO2 and SiC for stability in-vivo. Main results. High-resolution retinal implants with integrated shunt resistors were fabricated with values ranging from 0.75 to 4 M\u03a9 on top of the photovoltaic pixels of 55, 40, 30 and 20 \u00b5m in size. Photoresponsivity with all pixel sizes was approximately 0.53 A W\u22121, as high as in the arrays with no shunt resistor. The shunts shortened electrodes discharge time, with the average electric potential in electrolyte decreasing by only 21%\u201331 % when repetition rate increased from 2 to 30 Hz, as opposed to a 54%\u201355 % decrease without a shunt. Similarly, contrast of a Landolt C pattern increased from 16%\u201322 % with no shunt to 22%\u201334 % with a shunt. Further improvement in contrast is expected with pillar electrodes and local returns within each pixel. Significance. Miniature shunt resistors in a M\u03a9 range can be fabricated from doped a-Si in a process compatible with manufacturing of photovoltaic arrays. The shunt resistors improved current injection and spatial contrast at video frame rates, without compromising the photoresponsivity. These advances are critical for scaling pixel sizes below 100\u202f\u00b5m to improve visual acuity of prosthetic vision.",

    "content": "Objective. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, encompassing a prodromal stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where patients may either progress to AD or remain stable. The objective of the work was to capture structural and functional modulations of brain structure and function relying on multimodal MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphisms, also in case of missing views, with the twofold goal of classifying AD patients versus healthy controls and detecting MCI converters. Approach. We propose a multimodal deep learning (DL)-based classification framework where a generative module employing cycle generative adversarial networks was introduced in the latent space for imputing missing data (a common issue of multimodal approaches). Explainable AI method was then used to extract input features\u2019 relevance allowing for post-hoc validation and enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. Main results. Experimental results on two tasks, AD detection and MCI conversion, showed that our framework reached competitive performance in the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of (CI [0.90, 0.95]) and (CI [0.70, 0.72]) in the two tasks, respectively. The interpretability analysis revealed gray matter modulations in cortical and subcortical brain areas typically associated with AD. Moreover, impairments in sensory-motor and visual resting state networks along the disease continuum, as well as genetic mutations defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified. Significance. Our integrative and interpretable DL approach shows promising performance for AD detection and MCI prediction while shedding light on important biological insights.",

    "content": "There are dream metaphors that express waking-life experiences indirectly. Animals in dreams have been speculated to be related to dream metaphors. Here, we explored if there was any relationship between waking-life experiences related to elder relatives with both dreaming about elder relatives and dreaming about animals. For 1 day, 270 participants recorded waking-life experiences in daily diaries before sleeping and recorded their dreams upon waking. Two external judges rated if there was any content related to elder relatives or animals in both daily diaries and dreams. The most three frequent animals in dreams were dogs, cats, and snakes, or fishes, or birds. The frequency of waking-life experiences related to elder relatives was correlated with both the frequency of dreaming about elder relatives and the frequency of dreaming about animals. Yet, the latter two variables were not correlated with each other. The results supported the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. In addition, the results may suggest that some animals in dreams represented elder relatives in waking life metaphorically. Moreover, the results may support Carl Jung\u2019s idea that the image of animals in dreams may be a symbol of parents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Whose sexual dream experiences are more intense? An exploratory study on the relationship between personality traits and sexual dreams.",
    "content": "Sexual dreams reflect individuals\u2019 attitudes toward sex, the personal significance of sex, and/or sexual issues in their waking life. Gaining insight into the factors associated with the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences is beneficial for achieving a comprehensive assessment of sexual mental health. The study will explore the relationship among personality traits, anxiety, depression, and sexual dream experiences based on the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. A questionnaire was administered to 384 participants (mean age = 20.63 years, SD = 1.21; 205 females, 179 males), revealing that over half of them reported having sexual dreams, with a higher prevalence among males. The sexual dream group scored higher than the nonsexual dream group on aggressiveness, neuroticism, and sensation seeking. Furthermore, negative emotions, sensation seeking, activity, and extraversion play an important role in the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences among sexual dreamers. These findings provide valuable insights for sexual education practitioners to understand individuals\u2019 sexual dream experiences and related psychological factors, contributing to scientific advancements in sexual health and education.

    "content": "In separate literature\u2014end-of-life experiences, dreams in bereavement, and continuing bonds in bereavement\u2014there are preliminary findings that both dreaming of the deceased and having an experiential encounter while awake are common experiences. The present, brief report is a post hoc analysis of previously unanalyzed items from two studies of bereaved individuals. One study focused on loss following the death of a romantic partner (n = 268) and the other following the death of a dog or cat (n = 199). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had dreamed of the deceased or had a waking experience of seeing, hearing, or feeling the touch of the deceased in the prior month. Consistent with prior research, a substantial portion of each sample (50.7% of the partner loss participants and 32.2% of the pet loss) reported at least one waking experience of seeing, hearing, and/or feeling the deceased. When dreaming of the deceased and/or having a waking experience of the deceased were combined, it was found to be 82.5% for partner loss and 68.2% for pet loss. Furthermore, dreaming about the deceased was related to having such waking experiences. These preliminary, exploratory findings contribute to the growing recognition that we need more research and theory into the function of such experiences for the bereaved and for those facing end of life.

    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study compared the relative strength of these dispositions in predicting nightmare frequency. A sample of 116 university students completed measures of nightmare frequency, neuroticism, nightmare proneness, thin psychological boundaries, and sensory processing sensitivity. After accounting for sociodemographic variables and dream recall frequency, only nightmare proneness and thin boundaries significantly independently predicted nightmare frequency. These findings highlight the importance of nightmare proneness and thin boundaries as predictors, underscoring the need for further research with diverse samples to better understand these relationships.

This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Anti-ELAB) was a 7-month large-scale and highly traumatic social movement in Hong Kong that began in March 2019 in opposition to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government to amend its extradition laws. Using a sample of 112 Chinese young adult (74 females, 38 males, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.83) residents in Hong Kong, this article reports an investigation into relationships between trauma (as manifested in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), dream content (dream motifs, classified according to persecution or ego ideal delusional inclinations), and nightmare distress, all recalled by participants in relation to personal experiences of the Anti-ELAB. The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay. Potential explanations for the findings as well as their implications for further research and clinical practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "content": "The cerebellar granule cell layer receives mossy fiber inputs from diverse brain regions, yet the principles governing how individual granule cells sample distinct types of inputs remain poorly understood. Using a volumetric correlated light and electron microscopy (vCLEM) dataset from an adult female mouse cerebellum, in which VGluT1 positive and VGluT1 negative mossy fiber terminals are molecularly distinguished, we reconstructed granule cell and mossy fiber connectivity to examine input selection rules. We constructed spatially constrained null models to simulate sampling during adulthood and development. Granule cell-centered analysis showed that granule cells shared less innervation from the same mossy fiber than expected by chance. Moreover, subpopulations of granule cells preferentially sample either VGluT1 positive or VGluT1 negative mossy fibers. In contrast, mossy fiber centered analysis showed that individual terminals distributed their outputs across granule cells in a pattern consistent with random sampling. However, sampling in the adult state was more selective than in developmental simulations. Together, our findings demonstrated structured, non random sampling of cerebellar VGluT1 positive and VGluT1 negative mossy fiber inputs and provide a framework for understanding how granule cells integrate molecularly distinct inputs to support cerebellar computation.",

    "content": "Ongoing experience is continuously processed in the context of past events. Divergence between current experience and memory-based predictions (i.e., a mnemonic prediction error; MPE) is theorized to be a signal for the hippocampus that encoding, as opposed to retrieval, should be prioritized. We asked how MPEs place demands on cognitive and neural resources beyond the hippocampus, and whether these demands differ as a function of prediction strength. We investigated these questions across two experiments, wherein we recorded scalp electroencephalography and/or pupillometry as 101 young human adults performed an associative memory task. Strong MPEs, more so than weak MPEs, increased physiological indices of cognitive control (frontal theta), attention (posterior alpha and pupil size), and arousal (pupil size). Trial-level pupil-linked MPE responses scaled with the amount of attention (posterior alpha) allocated during prediction generation. Finally, greater cognitive control (frontal theta) during strong MPEs promoted better learning of prediction violating (i.e., unexpected) stimuli. Collectively, these findings reveal how the mind and brain respond adaptively to violations of strong mnemonic predictions.",

    "content": "Electrocorticography (ECoG) provides a high-spatiotemporal-resolution measure of cortical activity (cortical surface electrical potentials, CSEPs) in humans and animals. The CSEP high-gamma band (H{gamma}, 65-170 Hz) correlates with neuronal firing rates at the columnar spatial scale and is widely used as a biomarker of local activity. Whether H{gamma} reports all stages of columnar processing, intermediate processing in L2/3 (close to the ECoG electrode), or the main columnar output in L5, is unknown. We disentangled the laminar origins of H{gamma} and other ECoG bands by optogenetically suppressing L2/3 or L5 pyramidal cells during micro-ECoG recording in mouse somatosensory cortex. Whisker deflections evoked transient, topographically localized CSEPs. L5 optogenetic suppression most strongly reduced 65-450 Hz (H{gamma}-uH{gamma}) bands in sensory-evoked ECoG signals, whereas L2/3 suppression most strongly reduced 4-30 Hz ({theta}-{beta}) bands. Thus, different CSEP frequency bands reflect layer-specific activity and are biomarkers of distinct stages of columnar processing.",

In this regard, investigators have focused on the effects of minor cannabinoid activation / desensitization of peripheral sensory neurons on nociceptive signaling and/or peripheral inflammation. With a focus on peripheral nociception, four common minor cannabinoids: cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabichromene (CBC) were studied in primary cultures of mouse Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons. We queried if calcium responses induced by the four cannabinoids differed in potency of activation, neuronal size preference, and dose-response relationships. Additionally, we determined the dependence of CBD and CBN on key channel-receptors that are known to mediate pain and/or antinociception. Individually, CBD, CBG and CBC directed greater response magnitudes when compared to CBN. All four minor cannabinoids activated overlapping but distinct size populations of sensory neurons. CBD and CBG activated the widest range of DRG neuron sizes (smaller-larger) overlapping with smaller capsaicin-sensitive neurons. In contrast, CBN and CBC activated predominantly larger sensory neurons. CBD diverged from other minor cannabinoids in directing a linear dose-response profile whereas CBG and CBC directed sigmoidal dose-response profiles and CBN activated DRG neurons with an inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship. CBD-induced activation of DRG neurons was dependent on co-expression of the nociceptive channel TRPV1 plus cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R), whereas CBN-induced activation was independent of TRPV1. Overall, we observed that minor cannabinoids CBD, CBG, CBN and CBC differed in their activation of DRG neurons and directed unique activation properties across a diverse population of sensory neurons. Such differences underly the hypothesis that a combination (entourage) of complimentary minor cannabinoids can direct synergistic antinociceptive activity",

    "title": "Abnormal expression of splicing regulators RBFOX and NOVA is associated with aberrant splicing patterns at the Neurexin-3 gene in a monogenic autism spectrum disorder",
    "content": "Autism spectrum disorders are diseases characterized by a combination of cognitive, behavioral and neurological symptoms. A complex interplay between environmental factors and a multitude of genetic determinants, most of them composed of low-risk variants, impose difficulties in understanding the molecular and cellular underpinnings of these conditions. In some cases, autistic patients have been shown to display alterations in splicing patterns of several genes, but the extent to which this phenomenon is common in the context of these multifactorial disorders is unknown, nor is it known if monogenic cases of autism also display dysregulation of splicing. Moreover, very few studies have investigated the causal links between splicing alterations in specific genes and the phenotypic characteristics of the neural tissue in autism patients. In this study, we have focused on a monogenic type of autism caused by haploinsufficiency of the Transcription Factor 4 gene, known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome. We show that neurons and organoids derived from patients with this disease have altered expression of splicing regulators in the NOVA and RBFOX families, accompanied by aberrant splicing patterns in a substantial number of genes involved in neural tissue development and synapse organization. We focused on a gene encoding a member of the Neurexin Family, the splicing of which normally leads to the production of transcript variants coding for both transmembrane and secreted protein isoforms. In Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome neurons, we detected an aberrant splicing pattern that results in lower expression of the transcript that encodes the secreted isoform, a phenomenon that may explain why the neural tissue in these patients have decreased electrical activity through impaired synapse organization. Our data shed light on the role splicing regulation plays in a monogenic type of autism.",

    "title": "The Somatostatin Pathway Projected from the Basal Forebrain to the Lateral Habenula Promotes Isoflurane Anesthesia Recovery",
    "content": "<p>The basal forebrain (BF) acts as a pivotal relay station in the transmission of arousal signals, projecting to both cortical and subcortical structures. Among its downstream targets is the lateral habenula (LHb), which recent research has implicated in the modulation of sleep rhythms and in mediating the loss of consciousness associated with anesthetic agents. In our study, we utilized optogenetic manipulation to selectively modulate the BF<sup>VGluT2/SOM</sup> neuron projection pathway to the LHb, thereby examining its impact on behavioral and electroencephalographic responses to isoflurane anesthesia. Our results demonstrated that in healthy adult male mice, the activation of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway significantly prolonged the induction time of anesthesia and shortened recovery time, consequently diminishing the anesthetic potency of isoflurane and reducing EEG <i></i> power. In contrast, the inhibition of this pathway yielded the inverse effects. Notably, modulation of the BF<sup>VGluT2</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway did not significantly affect the induction or recovery times of isoflurane anesthesia. Employing optogenetics in conjunction with calcium signal recording, we elucidated that the arousing effect of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb pathway is attributable to the enhanced inhibitory action of BF<sup>SOM</sup> neurons on LHb<sup>Glu</sup> neurons. This discovery sheds new light on the neural circuits involved in the loss and recovery of consciousness induced by anesthetic drugs, potentially informing future therapeutic strategies.</p>",

    "title": "Stopping Muscle Contractions and Relaxations during Action Inhibition Involves Global and Targeted Control Dependent on Muscle State",
    "content": "<p>The mechanisms underpinning the stopping of muscle contractions and relaxations during action inhibition remain unclear. Central stop commands may be targeted and act on task-active muscles only, or instead be global, acting on task-passive muscles as well. We addressed this question in three stop signal task experiments with human participants (<i>n</i> = 54; 18 male, 36 female). While maintaining baseline force levels (10% MVC) in both index fingers, Go signals required participants to increase or decrease this force in the task-active finger (Task-active Contract vs Task-active Relax) while keeping activity in the task-passive muscle constant. On 30% of trials, delayed stop signals instructed participants to stop the task-active responses. Stop-related activity was detected in task-active muscles at the single trial level, using electromyography (EMG), and used to determine whether stop-related activity was also present in task-passive muscles. We found that stop commands act on both task-active and task-passive muscles, suggesting global control. This global control was furthermore muscle state specific, by decreasing muscle activity when stopping contractions and increasing muscle activity when stopping relaxations. However, stopping muscle contractions involved more sustained suppression of muscle activity in task-active than task-passive muscles, suggesting additional targeted control. This was not the case when stopping muscle relaxations, which only showed evidence of global control. Our results may explain how complex, real-world actions are inhibited. Global stop commands that are sensitive to muscle state may rapidly adjust muscle activity across the body, with additional control targeted to contracting, task-active muscles.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Behavioral outcomes are rarely certain, requiring subjects to discriminate between available choices by using feedback to guide future decisions. Probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) tasks test subjects&rsquo; ability to learn and flexibly adapt to changes in reward contingencies. Cortico-striatal circuitry has been broadly implicated in flexible decision-making&mdash;though what role these circuits play remains complicated. In this study we leveraged the fast temporal dynamics of local field potentials to precisely identify the role that cortico-striatal networks play during PRL reward feedback. We measured widespread (32-CH) local field potential activity of male Long&ndash;Evans rats during a PRL task wherein a target response delivered reward on 80% of trials while a non-target response delivered reward on 20% of trials. When subjects learned those reward probabilities, contingencies were reversed. We found that reward-evoked oscillations at beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) and high gamma (&gt;70&nbsp;Hz) frequencies marked positive reward valence and reflected probability of reward. Activity and connectivity at beta frequencies between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum during expected rewards were correlated with behavioral performance and specific aspects of value/exploitative behavior as defined by a reinforcement learning computational model. Finally, we found that modulating beta activity in orbitofrontal cortex with optogenetic (20&nbsp;Hz) stimulation promoted maladaptive behavior when stimulation was provided during non-target responses, consistent with our data and computational model predictions. Reward-evoked beta oscillations may reflect a crucial component underlying reward learning, and erroneous elevations in this physiological signal may contribute to maladaptive task performance and behavioral disruptions.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Behavioral change studies mostly focus on external reinforcements to modify preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) is a paradigm that influences preferences by the mere association of stimuli, sensory cues, and a rapid motor response, without external reinforcements. The behavioral effect has been shown to last for months after less than 1&nbsp;h of training. Here, we used a modified version of CAT by changing the neutral-cue to a number that represented a monetary amount of reward that the participants accumulate (i.e., incentive-cue). After a single training session, we compared behavioral performance and functional connectivity (FC), as measured by resting-state scans using functional magnetic resonance imaging, between two groups (total of 107 males and females in both groups), one receiving a neutral-cue and the other receiving an incentive-cue, at five time points across 1&nbsp;year. We replicated the maintenance of behavioral changes after 6&nbsp;months for the nonexternally reinforced neutral-cue participants, but not for the reinforced group. The reinforced training group showed higher FC within the limbic system, whereas the nonexternally reinforced group showed higher functional connectivity within and between default mode and dorsal attention networks. Our findings offer putative neural correlates for both reinforced and nonexternally reinforced preference changes that are maintained over time and which could be implemented in future behavioral change interventions.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by mislocalization and aggregation of proteins in motor neurons. Ataxin-2 (ATXN2), an RNA-binding protein harboring 22-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats, is a risk factor for ALS, when its polyQ repeats are expanded to 27&ndash;33 repeats. However, the physiological function of ATXN2 beyond its role in RNA regulation and how polyQ expansion in ATXN2 increases risk for ALS remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that <i>Drosophila</i> Atx2 functions as a regulator of microtubule (MT) dynamics in motor neurons. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism underlying Atx2-mediated MT regulation and how polyQ expansion disrupts its function, using a mixed-sex population of <i>Drosophila</i> as a model system. Specifically, we show that Atx2 requires its RNA-binding Lsm domain to regulate MTs. Notably, the LSM domains of human ATXN2 rescue MT phenotype in <i>Drosophila</i>, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved role of ATXN2 in MT regulation. Importantly, we find that polyQ-expanded ATXN2 forms cytoplasmic aggregates and leads to excessive MT destabilization. Additionally, polyQ expansion severely impairs axon outgrowth. Finally, we identify uncoordinated-76 (UNC-76/FEZ1) as a downstream effector of Atx2 in MT regulation and neuronal development.</p>",

    "content": "ObjectiveHormonal contraceptives (HCs) are linked to mood disturbances, but the neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated whether HC use is associated with altered central serotonergic activity, using the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP).MethodsFifty-four healthy women (30 current HC users and 24 non-users) completed EEG recordings to assess LDAEP. Depressive symptoms were quantified using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Between-group analyses were controlled for age and depressive symptoms, and effects of menstrual cycle phase, HC type, and mood-related side effects were also examined.ResultsHC users showed significantly steeper LDAEP slopes than non-users across components (all p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.028) consistent with reduced central serotonergic activity. This remained significant controlling for age and depressive symptoms. No significant effects of menstrual cycle phase or HC type, but HC users reporting adverse mood effects had more somatic symptoms, without corresponding LDAEP differences.ConclusionThis study is, to our knowledge, among the first to explicitly test an a priori hypothesis that HC use is associated with reduced serotonergic activity indexed by LDAEP in healthy women, and shows that HC use is linked to attenuated central serotonergic activity independent of mood symptoms. These findings underscore the role of sex hormones in shaping serotonergic function and may explain individual variability in mood and antidepressant response.",

    "content": "IntroductionTo address the challenges of cumulative errors, insufficient modeling of complex spatiotemporal features, and limitations in computational efficiency and generalization ability in 4D trajectory prediction, this paper proposes a high-precision, robust prediction method.MethodsA hybrid model SVMD-DBO-RCBAM is constructed, integrating sequential variational modal decomposition (SVMD), the dung beetle optimization algorithm (DBO), and the ResNet-CBAM network. Innovations include frequency-domain feature decoupling, dynamic parameter optimization, and enhanced spatio-temporal feature focusing.ResultsExperiments show that the model achieves a low longitude MAE of 0.0377 in single-step prediction, a 38.5% reduction compared to the baseline model; in multi-step prediction, the longitude R2 reaches 0.9844, with a 72.9% reduction in cumulative error rate and an IQR of prediction errors less than 10% of traditional models, demonstrating high accuracy and stability.DiscussionExperiments show that the model achieves a low longitude MAE of 0.0377 in single-step prediction, a 38.5% reduction compared to the baseline model; in multi-step prediction, the longitude R2 reaches 0.9844, with a 72.9% reduction in cumulative error rate and an IQR of prediction errors less than 10% of traditional models, demonstrating high accuracy and stability.",

    "title": "Personalized whole-brain models of seizure propagation",
    "content": "Objective. Computational modeling has recently emerged as a powerful tool to better understand seizure dynamics and guide new treatment strategies. This work aims to develop and personalize whole-brain computational models in epilepsy using multimodal clinical data to simulate and evaluate individualized therapeutic strategies. Approach. We present a computational framework that constructs patient-specific whole-brain models of seizure propagation by integrating SEEG, MRI, and diffusion MRI data. The pipeline uses neural mass models for each node in the network, simulating whole-brain dynamics. Model personalization involves adjusting global and local parameters representing the excitability of individual brain areas, using an evolutionary algorithm that aims to maximize the correlation between empirical and synthetic functional connectivity matrices derived from SEEG data. Main results. The resulting personalized models successfully reproduce individual seizure propagation patterns and can be used to simulate therapeutic interventions like surgery, stimulation, or pharmacological interventions within a unified physiological framework. Notably, model predictions reveal distinct patient-specific responses across interventions, including variable sensitivity to different pharmacological agents and identification of critical regions whose removal or modulation reduced seizure spread. Significance. This framework provides a mechanistic, interpretable approach to simulate and compare individualized treatment strategies. By integrating multimodal data into a unified whole-brain model, it has the potential to improve clinical decision-making in epilepsy by identifying accessible and functionally relevant targets.",

    "title": "On carrier frequency in transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation: a narrative review",
    "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) using kilohertz frequency carrier modulation has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach to improve motor recovery and reduce pain. Early application of 5\u201310 kHz modulated pulses for tSCS has shown promising results in spinal cord (SC) injury and post-stroke rehabilitation, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. Approach. This narrative review synthesizes electrophysiological, computational and clinical evidence to assess how kilohertz modulation influences spinal and corticospinal excitability and analgesia. A total of 20 preclinical and clinical studies comparing the effects of kHz-modulated and conventional stimulation pulses were reviewed. Main results. The results indicate that kilohertz modulated tSCS increases tolerance to stimulation, but requires a higher charge to evoke motor responses in healthy participants and individuals with post-stroke motor disorder. Compared to conventional stimulation, modulated stimulation recruits afferents less efficiently at motor threshold intensity but appears to engage broader corticospinal circuits, especially near or below threshold. Frequency-specific effects include prolonged spinal inhibition, frequency-dependent modulation of supraspinal input, and selective activation of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. Computational study supports these observations, showing that kilohertz pulses produce delayed action potential initiation due to alternating depolarization cycles. A comparative functional study has shown that modulated tSCS improves motor function in individuals with SC injury more significantly than conventional stimulation. Significance. This narrative review highlights gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of modulated tSCS, suggests directions for further research and will be useful in planning studies on the mechanisms behind tSCS with and without carrier frequency. It also holds engineering relevance for the optimal design of stimulation devices.",

    "title": "Helical neural implants for intracerebral drug delivery",
    "content": "Objective. Neurological disorders often arise from specific regions of dysfunction in the brain. One approach to target these pathologic regions is through chemical delivery using intracerebral implants. Previous works have designed implants that are small and flexible, minimizing the mechanical mismatch between inorganic implants and soft organic brain tissue. Most of these implants are simple cylindrical catheters with inflow and outflow ports at either end of the cylinder. This limits the region and volume of tissue that can be dosed. We sought to develop novel catheter designs that permit targeting of larger volumes of brain tissue while maintaining minimal footprint to minimize gliosis. Approach. We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel helical-shaped microfluidic catheter we term SPIRAL (Strategic Precision Infusion for Regional Administration of Liquid). SPIRAL leverages rational fluidic design of multiple fluid outflow ports to vary infused fluid spatial distribution across brain regions. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models to test the fluid dynamic functionality and chronic viability of SPIRAL. Results. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) models illustrate how SPIRAL can be configured to permit simultaneous dosing through multiple outflow ports yielding a variable fluid distribution compared to a straight catheter. We show how CFD in silico models can be used to optimize dimensions of channel openings across SPIRAL, to achieve uniform flow through channels and validate these results in vitro. We show how chronically implanted SPIRAL catheters do not increase gliosis compared to standard straight catheters of similar dimensions or materials. Significance. Our helical intracerebral drug delivery catheter facilitates fluid localization while maintaining minimal invasiveness. SPIRAL could enable multiregional brain access and improve therapeutic efforts in the treatment of neurological diseases.",

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Attention \u26a0\ufe0f : NOT another AI wrapper</p> <p>Beta released today - open to feedback - especially bugs</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/tylerrobbins5678/PyThermite\">https://github.com/tylerrobbins5678/PyThermite</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pythermite/\">https://pypi.org/project/pythermite/</a></p> <p>-<strong>what My Project Does</strong></p> <p>PyThermite is a rust backed python object indexer that supports nested objects and queries with real-time data. In plain terms, this means that complex data relations can be conveyed in objects, maintained state, and queried easily. For example, if I have a list of 100k cars in a city and want to get a list of cars moving between 20 and 40 mph and the owner of the car is named &quot;Jim&quot; that was born after 2005, that can be a single built query with sub 1 ms response. Keep in mind that the cars speed is constantly changing, updating the data structures as it goes.</p> <p>In testing, its significantly (20- 50x) faster than pandas dataframe filtering on a data size of 100k. Query time complexity is roughly O(q + r) where q is the amount of query operations (and, or, in, eq, gt, nesting, etc) and r is the result size. </p> <p>The cost to index is defined paid and building the structure takes around 6-7x longer than a dataframe consuming a list, but definitely worth it if the data is queried more than 3-4 times</p> <p>Performance has been and is still a constant battle with the hashmap and b-tree inserts consuming most of the process time. </p> <p>-<strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Currently this is not production ready as it is not tested thoroughly. Once proven, it will be supported and continue driving towards ETL and simulation within OOP driven code. At this current state it should only be used for analytics and analysis </p> <p>-<strong>Conparison</strong></p> <p>This competes with traditional dataframes like arrow, pandas, and polars, except it is the only one that handles native objects internally as well as indexes attributes for highly performant lookup. There's a few small alternatives out there, but nothing written with this much focus on performance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Interesting-Frame190\"> /u/Interesting-Frame190 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nwnr98/pythermite_rust_backed_object_indexer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nwnr98/pythermite_rust_backed_object_indexer/\">[comments]</a></span>",

From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

&nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

    "title": "Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanoflowers Rescue Immune Cells from the Cytotoxic Effects of Amyloid Aggregates",
    "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe pathology caused by a progressive degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Although etiology of PD remains unclear, accumulating evidence indicates that neurodegenerative effects are triggered by the abrupt aggregation of a-synuclein (a-Syn), a small membrane protein that is responsible for cell vesicle trafficking. a-Syn aggregates are highly toxic to neurons and immune cells present in the brain, including macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells. Transition metal dichalcogenide nanoflowers (TMD NFs) are novel nanomaterials with unique optical and biological properties. However, their effects on the immune system remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate cytoprotective properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) NFs on macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells exposed to a-Syn fibrils. We found that MoSe2 NFs exerted strong cytoprotective properties fully mitigating toxic effects of a-Syn fibrils, while MoS2 NFs were found to be significantly less potent in rescuing immune cells from a-Syn aggregates. At the same time, MoS2 NFs triggered polarization of macrophages into M1 and dendritic cells into M2 phenotypes, while an increase in both M1 and M2 was observed in microglia exposed to MoS2 NFs. MoSe2 NFs did not trigger polarization of DC cells and microglia in M1/M2 phenotypes, while MoSe2 NFs-facilitated polarization of macrophages into M1 was observed. These results indicate that TMD NFs could be used to improve viability of immune cells and attenuate their phenotypes, which, ultimately, can be used to treat PD and other neurodegenerative pathologies.",

    "title": "Sequelae and reversal of age-dependent alterations in mitochondrial dynamics via autophagy enhancement in reprogrammed human neurons",
    "content": "How aging of human neurons affects dynamics of essential organelle such as mitochondria and autophagosomes remains largely unknown. MicroRNA-induced directly reprogrammed neurons (miNs) derived from adult fibroblasts retain age-associated signatures of the donor, enabling the study of age-dependent features in human neurons, including longitudinal isogenic samples. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that neurons derived from elderly individuals are characterized by gene expression changes associated with the regulation of autophagosomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria, compared to young counterparts. To clarify these changes at the cellular level, we performed live-cell imaging of cellular organelles in miNs from donors of different ages. Older donor miNs exhibit decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, which surprisingly co-occurs with a significant increase in mitochondrial fission and fusion events. We posit that the increased fission and fusion of mitochondria may reflect age-dependent compensation for impaired mitochondrial turnover, perhaps due to changes in autophagy. We subsequently identified a significant decrease in autophagosome acidification in neurons derived from individuals >65 years compared to younger donors, and a corresponding age-dependent reduction in neuritic lysosomes resulting in fewer lysosomes available to acidify autophagosomes. This age-dependent deficit in autolysosome flux was rescued by chemically promoting autophagosome generation, which also reversed the age-dependent increase in mitochondrial fission and fusion and improved mitochondrial health. Together, this work reveals a mechanism by which aging reduces autophagic flux secondary to a loss of neuritic lysosomes, resulting in in mitochondria-intrinsic mechanisms to avoid loss of energy production.",

    "content": "<p>While cerebrovascular dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis are extensively characterized hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the dynamic relationship between reactive astrocytes and cerebral vessels remains poorly understood. Here, we used jGCaMP8f and two-photon microscopy to investigate calcium signaling in multiple astrocyte subcompartments, concurrent with changes in cerebral arteriole activity, in fully awake 7- to 8-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice, a model for AD-like pathology, and wild-type (WT) littermates. In the absence of movement, spontaneous calcium transients in barrel cortex occurred more frequently in astrocyte somata, processes, and perivascular regions of 5xFAD mice. However, evoked arteriole dilations (in response to air puff stimulation of contralateral whiskers) and concurrent calcium transients across astrocyte compartments were reduced in 5xFAD mice relative to WTs. Synchronous activity within multicell astrocyte networks was also impaired in the 5xFAD group. Using a custom application to assess functional coupling between astrocyte end feet and immediately adjacent arteriole segments, we detected deficits in calcium response probability in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, end feet calcium transients following arteriole dilations exhibited a slower onset, reduced amplitude, and lacked relative proportionality to vasomotive activity compared with WTs. The results reveal nuanced alterations in 5xFAD reactive astrocytes highlighted by impaired signaling fidelity between astrocyte end feet and cerebral arterioles. The results have important implications for the mechanistic underpinnings of brain hypometabolism and the disruption of neurophysiologic communication found in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The central amygdala (CeA) is an important neuronal hub that integrates external sensory inputs and information about internal states to regulate a range of innate and learned behaviors, including fear learning and memory. Prior studies, leveraging robust fear conditioning assays, have delineated detailed circuit mechanisms underlying the acquisition and recall of fear memories. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in the CeA remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the clock output molecule mWAKE/ANKFN1 within the CeA of male mice in fear learning and memory. mWAKE is expressed in multiple neuronal subclusters in the lateral CeA. Surprisingly, mWAKE levels do not exhibit rhythmic expression in the CeA. In line with this observation, expression of the core clock genes PER2 and BMAL also does not cycle in the CeA. Consistent with prior studies, loss of mWAKE function increases intrinsic excitability of CeA neurons. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of mWAKE and chemogenetic activation of CeA<sup>mWAKE</sup> neurons impair fear learning and memory. Finally, we show that mWAKE levels in a subset of CeA neurons are reduced following fear conditioning. These findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism modulating the activity and function of CeA neurons in fear learning and memory.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The sensorimotor system continuously uses error signals to remain precisely calibrated. We examined how attention influences this automatic and implicit learning process in humans (male and female). Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which attention was oriented either toward or away from the visual feedback that defined the error signal. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of sensorimotor adaptation. Using dual-task methods, we next examined the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused and divided attention conditions. However, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. These results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.</p>",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "content": "IntroductionIdentification and treatment of neurological disorders depend much on brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision support. Although they are loud, do not remain in one spot, and are rather complex, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are the principal tool used in research of brain function. This work employs an Adaptive Transformer-based technique with improved attention processes to extract temporal and spatial relationships in EEG data, effectively addressing these issues.MethodsFirst processed to eliminate noise and split them into time-series chunks, EEG data are then included into the proposed approach. Channel-wise embeddings and temporal encoding help to depict the data. Then, a transformer design including spatial attention for inter-channel interactions, multi-head self-attention for temporal aspects, and an adaptive attention mask for domain-specific modifications is used. Other openly accessible EEG datasets as well as the TUH EEG Corpus and CHB-MIT were evaluated against the model. Its performance was scored using metrics like accuracy, precision, memory, and F1-score.ResultsThe suggested method was more accurate than standard models like CNNs and LSTMs, with a score of 98.24%. The method was also shown to be able to find minor patterns in EEG data by improving precision and memory. Attention maps showed important areas of time and space, which made them easier to understand and useful in professional settings.DiscussionThe Adaptive Transformer turns out to be a useful tool for neurotherapeutic use of EEG data modeling. The approach provides greater medical assistance and knowledge on the functioning of the brain as well as answers significant issues. Future research might focus on subject-specific modifications and interaction with real-time systems.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models in revolutionizing EEG analysis for precision brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision-making.",

The Residual Convolutional Block Attention Module (RCBAM) serves as the teacher network to extract high-dimensional spatial features via residual structures and channel\u2013spatial attention. The student network adopts a Temporal Convolutional Network\u2013LSTM (TCN\u2013LSTM) design, integrating dilated causal convolutions and two LSTM layers for efficient temporal modeling. Historical ADS-B trajectory data from Zhuhai Jinwan Airport are preprocessed using cubic spline interpolation and a uniform-step sliding window to ensure data alignment and temporal consistency. In the distillation process, soft labels from the teacher and hard labels from actual observations jointly guide student trainingResultsIn multi-step prediction experiments, the distilled RCBAM\u2013TCN\u2013LSTM model achieved average reductions of 40%\u201360% in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE compared with the original RCBAM and TCN\u2013LSTM models, while improving R\u00b2 by 4%\u20136%. The approach maintained high accuracy across different prediction horizons while reducing computational complexity.DiscussionThe proposed method effectively balances high-precision modeling of spatiotemporal dependencies with lightweight deployment requirements, enabling real-time air-traffic monitoring and early warning on standard CPUs and embedded devices. This framework offers a scalable solution for enhancing the operational safety and efficiency of modern air-traffic control systems.",

    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies.

    "title": "Approaches for retraining sEMG classifiers for upper-limb prostheses",
    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

    "content": "IntroductionBased on tens of neuroimaging studies and a meta-analysis, we know that music expertise is associated with increases in brain volume and activity in structures related to audition, action, and various cognitive functions. What is less known is how music expertise affects the brain\u2019s functional connectivity during music listening.MethodsA novel algorithm, Leading Eigenvector Dynamic Analysis, was used to extract the specific dynamic patterns and the corresponding transition process during a naturalistic free-listening paradigm between 18 musicians and 18 non-musicians.ResultsWe found a brain state involving the frontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortex, associated with higher cognitive functions, emotional regulation, and reward, to be more recurrent in musicians during music listening compared to non-musicians. Transition processes revealed heightened engagement in areas linked to auditory processing, somatosensory integration, cognitive function, and emotional regulation in musicians. This enhanced dynamic connectivity might be linked to musicians\u2019 ability to integrate complex auditory stimuli and derive emotional meaning from them. Non-musicians, conversely, showed a tendency to engage more with the default mode network during music listening, possibly in relation to self-relevant mental processes and connection with personal experiences while being absorbed with the music.DiscussionThese findings highlight how music expertise shapes functional connectivity dynamics, musicians enhancing sensorimotor-cognitive integration and non-musicians relying on emotion and personal engagement.",

    "content": "Circadian rhythm plays a fundamental role in regulating biological functions, including sleep\u2013wake preferences, body temperature, hormone secretion, food intake, cognitive function and physical performance. The sleep chronotype, as part of the circadian rhythm, usually refers to an individual\u2019s subjective preference for their own sleep\u2013wake cycle. Because of the differences in brain microstructure and resting-state connections between different sleep chronotype, it may lead to differences in individual cognitive function. Concurrently, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between perioperative circadian misalignment and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), as well as targeted therapeutic strategies, have garnered increasing attention in recent research. Chronotype exerts regulatory effects on cognitive function via circadian rhythm modulation, neuroinflammatory cascades, and metabolic homeostasis. Perioperative alterations in sleep architecture\u2014including diminished slow-wave sleep (SWS) and circadian desynchronization\u2014may potentiate cognitive deficits and exacerbating neuroinflammation-mediated neuronal apoptosis. This review mainly focuses on the relationship between sleep chronotype and cognitive function as well as perioperative sleep chronotype changes, providing the latest evidence of relevant studies of domestic and foreign. In addition, different sleep patterns and postoperative cognitive dysfunction are prospected, which provides a new direction for exploring the different mechanisms of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in the future.",
