The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Anti-ELAB) was a 7-month large-scale and highly traumatic social movement in Hong Kong that began in March 2019 in opposition to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government to amend its extradition laws. Using a sample of 112 Chinese young adult (74 females, 38 males, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.83) residents in Hong Kong, this article reports an investigation into relationships between trauma (as manifested in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), dream content (dream motifs, classified according to persecution or ego ideal delusional inclinations), and nightmare distress, all recalled by participants in relation to personal experiences of the Anti-ELAB. The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay. Potential explanations for the findings as well as their implications for further research and clinical practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "title": "Effects of AC induced electric fields on neuronal firing sensitivity and activity patterns",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "title": "Amorphous silicon resistors enable smaller pixels in photovoltaic retinal prosthesis",
    "content": "Objective. Clinical trials of the photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis PRIMA demonstrated feasibility of prosthetic central vision with resolution matching its 100 \u00b5m pixel width. To improve prosthetic acuity further, pixel size should be decreased. However, there are multiple challenges, one of which is related to accommodating a compact shunt resistor within each pixel that discharges the electrodes between stimulation pulses and helps increase the contrast of the electric field pattern. Unfortunately, standard materials used in integrated circuit resistors do not match the resistivity required for small photovoltaic pixels. Therefore, we used a novel material\u2014doped amorphous silicon (a-Si) and integrated it into photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes down to 20 \u00b5m. Approach. To fit within a few \u00b5m2 area of the pixels and provide resistance in the M\u03a9 range, the material should have sheet resistance of a few 100 k\u03a9 sq\u22121, which translates to resistivity of a few \u03a9 * cm. The a-Si layer was deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and its resistivity was adjusted by PH3 doping before encapsulating the resistors between SiO2 and SiC for stability in-vivo. Main results. High-resolution retinal implants with integrated shunt resistors were fabricated with values ranging from 0.75 to 4 M\u03a9 on top of the photovoltaic pixels of 55, 40, 30 and 20 \u00b5m in size. Photoresponsivity with all pixel sizes was approximately 0.53 A W\u22121, as high as in the arrays with no shunt resistor. The shunts shortened electrodes discharge time, with the average electric potential in electrolyte decreasing by only 21%\u201331 % when repetition rate increased from 2 to 30 Hz, as opposed to a 54%\u201355 % decrease without a shunt. Similarly, contrast of a Landolt C pattern increased from 16%\u201322 % with no shunt to 22%\u201334 % with a shunt. Further improvement in contrast is expected with pillar electrodes and local returns within each pixel. Significance. Miniature shunt resistors in a M\u03a9 range can be fabricated from doped a-Si in a process compatible with manufacturing of photovoltaic arrays. The shunt resistors improved current injection and spatial contrast at video frame rates, without compromising the photoresponsivity. These advances are critical for scaling pixel sizes below 100\u202f\u00b5m to improve visual acuity of prosthetic vision.",

This study explores a multiclass BCI system designed to classify multiple MI tasks using a low-cost EEG device.MethodsA BCI system was developed to classify six mental states: resting state, left and right hand movement imagery, tongue movement, and left and right lateral bending, using EEG data collected with the Emotiv EPOC X headset. Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance. The results support the feasibility of scalable, multiclass MI paradigms in low-cost, user-centered neurotechnology applications, while pointing to critical areas for future system enhancement.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

Recent developments in wearable MEG sensors hold potential to overcome this limitation, as they allow the placement of sensors closer to the cerebellum.MethodsWe leveraged the development of wearable optically pumped magnetometers to record on-scalp MEG (OP-MEG) during an established cerebellar learning paradigm\u2014eyeblink conditioning. In four healthy human adults, we first validated that OP-MEG can reliably detect cerebellar responses by examining responses to an air puff stimulus.ResultsSignificant responses were observed in sensors positioned over the cerebellar region in all four adults in response to the air puff. We then indirectly tested the hypothesis that these responses reflect the population-level spiking activity of Purkinje cells. The air-puff\u2013evoked responses diminished during the acquisition of conditioned responses, corresponding with previously observed changes in Purkinje cell activity in animals. Additionally, in three out of four participants, we observed a cerebellar evoked response just prior to the peak of the conditioned blink, resembling learning-associated shifts in Purkinje cell response latencies.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that OP-MEG is a viable method for recording cerebellar activity in humans. By bridging invasive animal recordings with non-invasive human neuroimaging, these findings provide further evidence of the cerebellum\u2019s role in human learning.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the cortical task-specific response patterns underlying the improvement of upper limb dysfunction in stroke patients using transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) paired with task-oriented training (TOT) under varying cognitive loads.MethodsIn this randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled trial, 30 patients with subacute stroke were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the taVNS group or the Sham group. Both groups received 3 weeks of TOT. The taVNS group received concurrent active taVNS, while the Sham group received concurrent sham stimulation. Assessments were performed pre- and post-intervention. Clinical function was evaluated using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Modified Barthel Index (MBI). Neurophysiological measures included heart rate variability (HRV) to assess taVNS efficacy and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to assess cortical excitability changes. Brain functional imaging was conducted using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during motor tasks with different cognitive loads (low-load: continuous horizontal movement; high-load: goal-directed movement) to analyze changes in spontaneous neural activity, task-related regional brain activation characteristics, and brain functional network alterations.Results(1) Post-intervention, the taVNS group showed significantly greater improvements in all HRV indices compared to the Sham group (P < 0.05). (2) Both groups exhibited significant improvements from baseline in FMA-UE, MoCA, MBI, and FSS scores (P < 0.05), with the taVNS group demonstrating significantly greater improvement than the Sham group (P < 0.05). (3) MEP results indicated significant improvements in the elicitation rate of ipsilesional MEPs within the taVNS group post-intervention (P < 0.05). Furthermore, compared to the Sham group, the taVNS group showed significantly greater improvements in the ipsilesional MEP elicitation rate and a significant reduction in contralesional MEP latency (P < 0.05). (4) Regarding resting-state fNIRS, the taVNS group exhibited higher Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF) values post-intervention in the ipsilesional prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and sensorimotor cortex (SMC) compared to the Sham group (P < 0.05), but these differences were not significant after correction. In task-state fNIR under the low-cognitive-load condition, activation levels in the ipsilesionalS primary motor cortex (M1) and premotor and supplementary motor areas (pSMA) were significantly higher in the taVNS group compared to the Sham group post-intervention (PFDR < 0.05). During the high-cognitive-load task, activation levels in the ipsilesional PFC and DLPFC were significantly higher in the taVNS group compared to the Sham group post-intervention (PFDR < 0.05). (5) Functional network analysis using complex network metrics revealed that the taVNS group exhibited significantly increased nodal clustering coefficient and nodal local efficiency in the ipsilesional DLPFC during the high-cognitive-load task post-intervention compared to the Sham group (PFDR < 0.05).ConclusiontaVNS paired with TOT enhances autonomic homeostasis, increases corticospinal pathway excitability, activates cognition-motor related brain regions, and modulates functional connectivity networks through multi-pathway neuroregulatory mechanisms. This promotes the formation of task-specific cortical activation and network connectivity during motor tasks under varying cognitive demands in stroke patients. These changes contribute to improved executive control performance in complex tasks, thereby enhancing cognitive-motor integration capabilities and facilitating upper limb functional recovery.Clinical Trial Registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/index.html, Unique Identifier/Registration Number: ChiCTR2400085163.",

    "content": "With the rapid development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, the effective integration of multimodal biological signals to improve classification accuracy has become a research hotspot. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit cross-modality correlations in complex cognitive tasks. To address this, this paper proposes a Multi-Branch Convolutional Neural Network with Attention (MBC-ATT) for BCI based cognitive tasks classification. MBC-ATT employs independent branch structures to process electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals separately, thereby leveraging the advantages of each modality. To further enhance the fusion of multimodal features, we introduce a cross-modal attention mechanism to discriminate features, strengthening the model's ability to focus on relevant signals and thereby improving classification accuracy. We conducted experiments on the n-back and WG datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms conventional approaches in classification performance, further validating the effectiveness of MBC-ATT in brain-computer interfaces. This study not only provides novel insights for multimodal BCI systems but also holds great potential for various applications.",

However, the specific methodologies used to induce nocebo effects on motor outcomes remain unexplored. This scoping review aimed to address three key questions: (1) What experimental protocols have been developed and used to elicit nocebo effects in motor performance in healthy individuals? (2) How are these effects assessed and measured? (3) What are the observed effects on motor outcomes?MethodsA scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA framework, searching PubMed, EBSCO, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception to March 2025. Eighteen studies were included.Results and discussionVerbal instruction was the most common induction method (94.4 %), often combined with conditioning or visual cues. Motor tasks assessed gross skills, such as sprinting and cycling), with limited attention given to fine motor control. Outcomes were more frequently centered on performance measures (e.g., strength, endurance), with less emphasis on movement quality (e.g., coordination). Nocebo effects were observed in half of the studies impairing motor performance, including reduced force production, diminished endurance, disrupted postural stability and slower movement speed. The findings highlight methodological diversity in induction protocols and measurement methods. Future research should expand participant diversity, investigate fine motor tasks, and further explore the interplay between induction methods and motor outcomes.",

    "title": "Flexible Working Memory in the Peripheral Nervous System",
    "content": "Working memory (WM) representations that are distributed across the brain can be flexibly recruited to best guide behavior. For instance, information may be represented relatively more strongly in visual cortex when a WM task requires fine visual detail, or more strongly in motor cortex when a specific response can be prepared. If WM is geared to prospectively guide actions, then we might also expect such task-oriented neural signals to propagate to the peripheral sensors and effectors that realize WM goals. Likewise, there is now evidence that oculomotor signals like saccade biases can track simple visuo-spatial WM features. However, it is unclear if such signatures are functionally meaningful, and how much information is contained in them. Here, we test the idea that WM content is adaptively distributed across the nervous system according to behavioral demands. Namely, we test whether visual WM stimulus features are expressed in patterns of both eye and hand movements during a WM delay, and whether the distribution of such peripheral motor activity shifts with the task context. In a delayed recall task, we manipulated how human participants reported their memory by having them either draw a line or adjust a wheel to match a remembered orientation. Via eye- and stylus-tracking, we found that remembered orientations were decodable from small inflections in both gaze and hand movements during the blank WM delay. Moreover, this decoding strength varied by response format: gaze patterns tracked memorized features relatively better in the wheel condition (vs. draw), while hand movements were better in the draw condition (vs. wheel). Individuals who showed greater wheel benefits in gaze-based decoding also showed greater draw benefits in hand-based decoding, suggesting a strategic processing shift to the more relevant system. Therefore, visually encoded WM contents may be adaptively allocated to the most task-relevant motor effectors, balancing WM representations across peripheral activity according to behavioral needs.",

Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the potential association between e-LFCNB% of total sleep time and the observed improvement in neurocognitive function following the specified treatment.ResultsA total of 362 subjects received CPAP and had e-LFCNB % measurements. For Sustained Working Memory Test-Overall Mid-Day (SWMT-OMD), e-LFCNB%\u202f>\u202f2.35% correlates positively with the proportion of participants who showed an increase in test scores > 0.65 after 2\u202fmonths CPAP treatment (OR: 2.617, 95% CI: 1.095\u20136.252, p: 0.030); e-LFCNB%\u202f>\u202f9.45% correlates positively with improvement in test scores > 0.8 after 6\u202fmonths CPAP treatment (OR: 2.553, 95% CI: 1.017\u20136.409, p: 0.046). For Buschke Selective Reminding Test sum recall (BSRT-SR), e-LFCNB%\u202f>\u202f3.65% correlates positively with an increase in test scores > 12 after 2\u202fmonths CPAP treatment (OR: 2.696, 95% CI: 1.041\u20136.982, p: 0.041). Results of the Pathfinder Number Test-Total Time (PFN-TOTL) were not significant.Conclusione-LFCNB% (probable high loop gain) may be a clinically useful predictor of cognitive improvement following CPAP.",

    "title": "Exploring the potential central regulatory mechanisms of acupuncture for acute-stage Bell\u2019s palsy: an fMRI-based investigation",
    "content": "ObjectiveThis study utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine changes in brain functional activity following acupuncture treatment for acute Bell\u2019s palsy (BP) and to investigate the potential central regulatory mechanisms involved.MethodsA total of 55 patients with acute Bell\u2019s facial paralysis (within 1\u20137 days of onset) were enrolled in the patient group, while 48 individuals without the condition were included as the healthy control group. The patient group received acupuncture therapy at EX-HN16 (Qianzheng), SJ17 (Yifeng), ST2 (Sibai), GB14 (Yangbai), EX-HN4 (Yuyao), SI18 (Quanliao), ST6 (Jiache), ST4 (Dicang), ST8 (Touwei), and bilateral LI4 (Hegu) points on the affected side. Each session lasted 30 min and was administered three times a week (Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday) until day 28 of the disease course. The patient group underwent fMRI scans, House\u2013Brackmann (H-B) grading, Sunnybrook scale evaluation, and facial disability index (FDI) assessment both prior to the initial treatment and on the 28th day. The healthy group received a single fMRI scan after enrollment. MATLAB R2017 software was used to calculate the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) in patients before and after treatment, as well as in healthy controls.ResultsFollowing treatment, the patient group showed significant improvements in H-B, Sunnybrook, and FDI scores compared to pretreatment levels (P < 0.05), with an overall effective rate of 96.4% (53/55). Prior to treatment, compared to healthy controls, patients exhibited decreased fALFF in the right posterior cingulate gyrus, increased fALFF in the right postcentral gyrus, left and right middle frontal gyri, and increased ReHo in the left precentral gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, and left middle occipital gyrus. After treatment, when compared to healthy controls, patients showed decreased fALFF in the left and right medial superior frontal gyri, and increased fALFF in the right postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and bilateral lingual gyri, and increased ReHo in the right precentral gyrus, bilateral transverse temporal gyri, right lingual gyrus, and right thalamus, and decreased ReHo in the right middle frontal gyrus. Relative to pretreatment values, patients displayed decreased fALFF in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and increased fALFF in the left precentral gyrus. Additionally, ReHo decreased the right and left medial superior frontal gyri, while it increased in the right inferior parietal angular gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and left superior parietal gyrus.ConclusionAcupuncture demonstrates a clear therapeutic effect on acute BP and contribute to clinical symptom improvement. Marked differences in brain functional activity were observed between patients and healthy individuals. The therapeutic effect of acupuncture may be linked to its ability to facilitate functional reorganization in brain regions associated with sensation, movement, and emotion.Clinical trial registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/searchproj.html? title=&amp;officialname=&amp;subjectid=&amp;regstatus=&amp;regno=ChiCTR2200065223& secondaryid=&amp;applier=&amp;studyleader=&amp;createyear=&amp;sponsor=&amp;secsponsor= &amp;sourceofspends=&amp;studyailment=&amp;studyailmentcode=&amp;studytype=&amp;study stage=&amp;studydesign=&amp;recruitmentstatus=&amp;gender=&amp;agreetosign=&amp;measure= &amp;country=&amp;province=&amp;city=&amp;institution=&amp;institutionlevel=&amp;intercode=& ethicalcommitteesanction=&amp;whetherpublic=&amp;minstudyexecutetime=&amp;maxstudy executetime=&amp;btngo=btn, identifier ChiCTR2200065223.",

    "title": "An ICA-based artifact suppression method for online extraction of TMS-evoked potentials: toward closed-loop TMS-EEG applications beyond the motor cortex",
    "content": "Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has become a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, TMS-EEG signals often suffer from severe artifacts, particularly in lateral cortical regions where TMS-evoked muscle artifacts are pronounced, making real-time recovery of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) challenging. We developed and validated a real-time, two-step independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact cleaning method for TMS-EEG signals, facilitating the rapid extraction of clean neural signals for closed-loop neurostimulation applications. Approach. Our method involves an offline ICA training phase, where ICA weights and artifact topographies are identified using pre-experimental trials, followed by an online phase in which the precomputed weight matrices are applied in real-time to incoming data. We conducted simulations on two pre-published TMS-EEG datasets (N = 28, ROIs = 6) to validate the method by identifying the minimum number of trials required to estimate ICA weights. We also assessed the reproducibility of TEPs and the stability of ICA components, taking classical offline TEPs as the relative ground truth. Main Results. ICA analysis suggests that it can be applied reliably within each region without significant loss of convergence and stability, provided careful consideration is given to the size and composition of the data used for ICA training. Simulation results indicated that while central regions could achieve reliable TEPs similar to ground truth with as few as 20\u201330 trials to train ICA in the pre-experimental phase, frontal and occipital regions required 50\u201360 trials to reach a comparable level of reliability. Later TEP peaks (>100 ms) in all regions achieved high reproducibility when at least 35 training trials were used, whereas earlier peaks (<80 ms) showed moderate reproducibility with the same number of trials. Significance. These findings establish the feasibility and proof-of-concept for real-time ICA-based artifact removal for closed-loop TMS-EEG applications. The method enables rapid extraction of clean neural signals, allowing adaptation of stimulation parameters in real time, thereby facilitating individualized neurostimulation paradigms.",

    "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

    "title": "Closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum modulation depth in temporal interference electrical brain stimulation",
    "content": "Objective. In temporal interference (TI) transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), an emerging brain stimulation technique, the interference of two high-frequency currents with a small frequency difference is used to target specific brain regions with better focality than in standard tES. While the magnitude of the modulation depth has been previously investigated, an explicit formula for the direction in which this modulation is maximized has been lacking. This work provides a novel closed-form analytical expression for the orientation of maximum modulation depth in TI tES. We also found a secondary orientation where the modulation depth has a local maximum. Moreover, we provide closed-form analytical formulas for this orientation as well as for the modulation depth along this orientation. To our knowledge, these closed-form expressions and the presence of the secondary maximum have not been previously reported. Approach. We derive compact analytical expressions and validate them through comprehensive computational simulations using a realistic human head model. We also provide a complete analytical derivation of the widely used formula for the maximum modulation depth magnitude stated in Grossman et al, 2017. Main results. Our simulations demonstrate that the modulation depth predicted with our new analytical direction formula is indeed the maximum compared to other directions. The derived closed-form expression provides a faster and more accurate alternative to iterative numerical optimization methods used in previous studies to estimate this direction. Furthermore, we found that due to interference in 3D, the modulation depth along the secondary maximum orientation can be of similar strength to the maximum modulation depth intensity when interfering electric field vectors are significantly misaligned. Finally, we show that by modifying the ratio of the injected current strengths, it is possible to steer these directions and fine-tune the stimulation along a desired direction of interest. Significance. Overall, this work provides a detailed treatment of TI electric fields in 3D. The presented closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum and secondary maximum modulation depths are relevant for the better interpretation of both simulated and experimental results in TI studies by allowing comparison with neuronal orientations in the brain.",

    "title": "Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy",
    "content": "Objective. The anti-correlation between the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) is a stable characteristic of normal brain activity. However, in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), this anti-correlation is often disrupted and strongly associated with epileptic seizures. This study aims to use periodic spatiotemporal patterns (PSTP) analysis to elucidate the relationship between the DMN-TPN anti-correlation and epileptic activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying IGE. Approach. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyze PSTP in both healthy controls and IGE patients. A pattern-finding algorithm was initially applied to identify repeated spatiotemporal patterns, followed by a novel PSTP-finding algorithm to uncover dynamic periodic patterns through analysis of fluctuations in the DMN-TPN anti-correlation. The Hilbert transform was applied to capture the underlying basic states of these periodic patterns. Additionally, the relationship between period length and intrinsic neural timescales (INT) was explored. Main results. IGE patients exhibited a reduced DMN-TPN anti-correlation, particularly during TPN-dominant states. Additionally, IGE patients exhibited greater dynamic instability in basic states, marked by more frequent transitions between transitional states. Furthermore, lower correlations between period length and INT were observed in cognitive regions of IGE patients. Significance. These findings suggest that dynamic switching between the DMN and TPN in IGE is weaker and less balanced, with disruptions in periodic rhythms linked to cognitive impairments. The proposed PSTP framework provides new insights into the abnormal rhythms of IGE from a spatiotemporal perspective.",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "title": "Dendritic Interaction of Timescales in Afterdepolarization Potentials and Nonmonotonic Spike--adding",
    "content": "Depolarizations that occur after action potentials, known as afterdepolarization potentials or ADPs, are important for neuronal excitability and stimulus evoked transient bursting. Slow inward and fast outward currents underlie the generation of such ADPs with modulation of ADP amplitudes occurring as a result of neuronal morphology. However, the relative contribution and role of these slow inward and fast outward currents in ADP generation is poorly understood in the context of somatic and dendritic localization as well as with varied dendritic properties. Using a two compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley type model, the role of somatic and dendritic compartmentalization of ADP associated currents is investigated, revealing that dendritic (rather than somatic) slow inward and fast outward currents are the main contributors to ADP and spike-adding during both brief step current and AMPA current input. Additionally, dendritic size and passive properties of the dendrites were found to be key modulators of ADP amplitude. However, increasing magnitudes of NMDA current conductance resulted in nonmonotonic spike-adding in a manner dependent on dendritic Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ activated K+ currents, which was found to be the result of tight regulation of stimulus evoked transient bursting through positive feedback on action potential generation by dendritic Ca2+ and subsequent negative feedback through Ca2+ activated K+ currents. This novel mechanism of ADP and spike-adding regulation highlights the role of currents with slow timescales in ADPs, stimulus evoked bursting and neuronal excitability with implications for Ca2+ dependent synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation.",

    "title": "Parkinson's disease LRRK2 mutations dysregulate iron homeostasis and promote oxidative stress and ferroptosis in human neurons and astrocytes",
    "content": "Background: Iron accumulation is a hallmark of sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology and correlates with clinical motor symptom severity. The biochemical mechanisms driving iron dyshomeostasis in PD brain and whether these are early or late event in the neurodegenerative process remain unknown. Elevated nigral iron levels have been reported in LRRK2 mutation carriers, both in PD patients compared to idiopathic PD and in asymptomatic carriers relative to controls, suggesting that iron accumulation precedes clinical onset in LRRK2-associated PD. However, the precise consequence of pathogenic LRRK2 mutations on cellular iron handling within neurons and glial cells remains unclear. Methods: Here, we investigated different readouts of iron homeostasis in iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes from PD patients harboring G2019S or R1441C/G LRRK2 mutations or healthy controls, as well as an isogenic iPSC panel with the same variants. By using high-content and super-resolution microscopy of iron-specific probes, we assayed iron content and distribution in cells and examined the downstream effects of iron dyshomeostasis on ferroptosis signaling. Results: We show that heterozygous LRRK2 mutations dysregulate cellular iron across iPSCs, neurons and astrocytes, in a kinase-dependent manner. Lysosomal ferrous iron storage was consistently elevated across iPSCs, iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes carrying LRRK2 mutations. LRRK2 regulates Rab GTPase function through their direct phosphorylation, and our prior work revealed significant but divergent lysosomal phenotypes between Rab8a and Rab10 knockout models. Here, we report that Rab8a knockout recapitulates key aspects of LRRK2 mutation phenotypes on intracellular iron and ferritin levels, although with differences in magnitude and specificity. By contrast, Rab10 deficiency showed opposing effects, suggesting distinct roles for these well-established LRRK2 substrates in iron homeostasis. Finally, we show that basal lipid peroxidation and ROS levels are elevated in isogenic LRRK2 mutant neurons, while iron chelation was sufficient to reduce LRRK2-dependent ROS. Conclusions: Together, our findings demonstrate that LRRK2 mutations disrupt iron homeostasis across disease-relevant cell types and establish a discrete biochemical pathway linking LRRK2 signaling and vulnerability to ferroptosis. Ongoing work aims to further dissect the roles of Rab substrates in these pathways.",

    "title": "Human patient-specific FOXG1 syndrome mouse model revealed FOXG1-MYCN-mediated regulation of protein homeostasis in neurodevelopmental disorder",
    "content": "Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by disruptions in brain development, resulting in cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments. FOXG1 syndrome (FS), caused by heterozygous mutations in the FOXG1 gene, exemplifies a severe monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder. To investigate its pathogenesis, we generated a patient-specific W300X mouse model carrying a truncation variant of FOXG1. We found that the truncated FOXG1 protein in W300X-heterozygous (W300X-Het) mice is more abundant and more nuclear-localized than the full-length FOXG1 protein, implicating a pathogenic mechanism involving the truncated protein. Interestingly, W300X-Het mice exhibited profound abnormalities in the dentate gyrus, including disrupted neurogenesis, impaired granule cell migration, and altered dendritic morphology. Transcriptomic profiling identified broad dysregulation in protein homeostasis pathways, particularly ribosomal biogenesis, translation, and proteostasis. Disruption of the FOXG1-MYCN pathway, critical for robust protein synthesis during neural stem cell division, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, emerged as a key mechanism underlying these defects. In parallel, microglial activation and inflammation were markedly increased in the dentate gyrus, contributing to a pro-inflammatory environment that exacerbates neurogenic and structural deficits. Consistent with hippocampal dysfunction in FS patients, W300X-Het mice exhibited significant spatial learning and memory impairments. Together, our study highlights disrupted protein homeostasis and neuroinflammation as key drivers of FS pathogenesis, providing a framework for developing therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.",

Animal model studies have been invaluable for demonstrating the importance of the DRG nociceptor in pain sensation and the development of related analgesic targets. However, there are functional biological differences between human and animal model nociceptors. Therefore, a complementary in vitro model of human nociception is critical to confirming the relevance of preclinical findings for therapeutic drug development. We characterized the nociceptive properties of differentiated cells from the human DRG-derived immortalized cell line HD10.6. Within differentiated HD10.6 cells, we documented the abundance and localization of nociceptive machinery central to regulating excitability and linked with pain sensation including ion channels TRPV1 and NaV1.7 and afferent peptides CGRP and Substance P. Using calcium influx imaging assays, we confirmed the electrical functionality of TRPV1 and NaV1.7 in HD10.6 cells, and through whole-cell patch clamp, we found similar baseline electrophysiological parameters of HD10.6 cells to those previously observed in human patient DRGs. Further, we found that differentiated HD10.6 cells express the mu opioid receptor 1 protein, and DAMGO, a mu agonist, blocks depolarization-evoked calcium influx in a naloxone-reversible fashion. Importantly, using an inflammatory cocktail, excitation and peripheral sensitization are induced within HD10.6 cells, mirroring nociceptors in a pain state during or after tissue damage or inflammation. Finally, HD10.6 cells were also cultured into dual-chambered microfluidic devices to mirror the biological anatomy of the nociceptor. Within this system, we demonstrated the uptake of adeno-associated-virus (AAV) by the peripheral terminals and AAV transport to the soma. Altogether, we have developed the use of HD10.6 cells to create a system of human nociceptive signaling on a chip to study human nociceptor physiology and intervention.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "Maximizing theoretical and practical storage capacity in single-layer feedforward neural networks",
    "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "Combinatorial protein barcodes enable self-correcting neuron tracing with nanoscale molecular context",
    "content": "Mapping nanoscale neuronal morphology with molecular annotations is critical for understanding healthy and dysfunctional brain circuits. Current methods are constrained by image segmentation errors and by sample defects (e.g., signal gaps, section loss). Genetic strategies promise to overcome these challenges by using easily distinguishable cell identity labels. However, multicolor approaches are spectrally limited in diversity, whereas nucleic acid barcoding lacks a cell-filling morphology signal for segmentation. Here, we introduce PRISM (Protein-barcode Reconstruction via Iterative Staining with Molecular annotations), a platform that integrates combinatorial delivery of antigenically distinct, cell-filling proteins with tissue expansion, multi-cycle imaging, barcode-augmented reconstruction, and molecular annotation. Protein barcodes increase label diversity by >750-fold over multicolor labeling and enable morphology reconstruction with intrinsic error correction. We acquired a [~]10 million m3 volume of mouse hippocampal area CA2/3, multiplexed across 23 barcode antigen and synaptic marker channels. By combining barcodes with shape information we achieve an 8x increase in automatic tracing accuracy of genetically labelled neurons. We demonstrate PRISM supports automatic proofreading across micron-scale spatial gaps and reconnects neurites across discontinuities spanning hundreds of microns. Using PRISM's molecular annotation capability, we map the distribution of synapses onto traced neural morphology, characterizing challenging synaptic structures such as thorny excrescences (TEs), and discovering a size correlation among spatially proximal TEs on the same dendrite. PRISM thus supports self-correcting neuron reconstruction with molecular context.",

    "title": "Exercise-induced DNA damage response and memory formation in mice",
    "content": "This study reveals that acute aerobic exercise enhances memory formation through a controlled DNA damage mechanism, offering crucial insights into Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention. This work challenges the traditional view that DNA damage is inherently harmful, demonstrating that minor, reversible DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) induced by exercise serve as necessary primers for memory consolidation - a mechanism that may be impaired in AD pathogenesis. AD affects 1 in 9 adults over 65, with ~95% being late-onset cases where up to 40% of risk factors are modifiable through lifestyle interventions like exercise. While exercise demonstrably lowers AD risk, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study provides a missing mechanistic link by showing how exercise-induced DNA damage repair systems could counteract the DNA damage accumulation and repair dysregulation that are established hallmarks of brain aging and AD. In data presented herein, young mice showed significantly higher SSB rates in active genomic regions compared to aged mice, suggesting the decline of a protective mechanism (i.e., hormesis) with aging - potentially explaining increased AD susceptibility in older adults. The present study also suggests that exercise-induced SSBs are not random cellular damage but precisely targeted events that occur at genes essential for neuroplasticity, synaptic function, and memory formation. These breaks activate PARP1 (Poly ADP ribose polymerase 1), a crucial DNA damage sensor that simultaneously initiates repair processes while facilitating transcriptional programs necessary for memory consolidation. This mechanism may represent how exercise \"primes\" the brain against the pathological DNA damage accumulation seen in AD. In support of this, in behavioral experiments, a single exercise bout converted sub-threshold learning into robust long-term memory formation. This memory enhancement correlated with upregulation of both neurotrophic genes (BDNF, Fos) and DNA repair enzymes (PARP1, PARP2), demonstrating coordinated damage-repair processes that appear compromised in AD. We identify HPF1 as a critical cofactor enabling PARP1 to perform trans-ADP-ribosylation of histones, linking DNA damage sensing to epigenetic chromatin remodeling required for memory-related gene expression. This pathway represents a novel therapeutic target for AD, as restoring efficient DNA repair mechanisms might slow or prevent memory loss.",

    "title": "Sustained dynamics of saccadic inhibition and adaptive oculomotor responses during continuous exploration",
    "content": "In natural environments, stimuli often recur across time and space, requiring the visual system to remain sensitive to novelty while managing predictability. A central question in systems neuroscience is how motor systems adapt to repeated sensory events without compromising responsiveness. We investigated this adaptive capacity using saccadic inhibition (SI), a reflexive suppression of eye movements triggered by sudden visual transients, as a probe of oculomotor dynamics during naturalistic viewing. Human participants (N = 21) freely explored visual arrays while brief gaze-contingent flashes appeared five times at random intervals, either foveally or parafoveally. SI reliably occurred ~120 ms post-flash across repetitions and locations, indicating robust sensory-driven inhibition. However, the rebound phase, reflecting saccade reprogramming, showed a progressive decline. In a second experiment (N = 19), only the first or the fifth flash was visible on each trial. In this case, neither inhibition nor rebound was altered, suggesting that the rebound decline is driven by repeated sensory stimulation rather than exploration time. This dissociation reveals selective habituation of motor re-engagement mechanisms, while reflexive inhibitory gating remains stable. We propose that inhibition is mediated by circuitry that transiently suppresses saccade initiation and resists habituation. By contrast, the weakening rebound reflects a separate, habituation-prone route that reduces saccade generation to irrelevant events. Functionally, this imbalance implies a recalibration within the saccade generator, preserving inhibitory capacity while constraining motor output. Our findings uncover a distinct form of oculomotor habituation and demonstrate how SI reveals dynamic decoupling of sensory input and motor output under repeated stimulation.",

    "title": "Postpartum enhancement of spatial learning and cognitive flexibility: an IntelliCage study",
    "content": "The transition to motherhood has been shown to result in significant changes in the structure and function of the brain, with particular emphasis on the enhancement of cognitive abilities that are essential for survival. Specifically, in murine models, spatial learning and cognitive flexibility have been identified as critical components of mothering. These abilities facilitate efficient navigation of the environment, resource acquisition, and responsiveness to offspring's needs. While cognitive enhancements during the postpartum period have been observed in various experimental setups, research using long-term data collection with automated monitoring in home cage setup is completely lacking even though it provides a more reliable approach than other experimental procedures. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by systematically examining spatial learning and cognitive flexibility in female mice during the reproductive stages using IntelliCage, with the objective of offering a more comprehensive understanding of maternal cognitive adaptations. Utilising the IntelliCage system, we observed that female mice in the postpartum phase outperformed pregnant and nulliparous females in place learning, reversal learning, and fixed schedule drinking tasks, demonstrating faster adaptation and superior retention of information. These paradigms mirror real-world challenges faced by mothers, such as navigating resources and balancing caregiving with self-maintenance. The enhanced performance demonstrated by the mothers could be attributed to their heightened motivation and cognitive abilities, potentially influenced by substantial hormonal shifts, which have been known to modify neuroplasticity in critical brain regions. The identification of these improvements in maternal behaviour may offer novel insights into the impact of reproductive experiences on brain function, with implications for maternal health and broader cognitive research.",

    "title": "PRRT2 as an auxiliary regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation",
    "content": "During sustained activity, voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels enter a slow inactivation state to limit cellular hyperexcitability. Disruption of this regulatory process has been implicated in skeletal, cardiac and neurological disorders. While the kinetics of this process are well characterized, its endogenous modulators remain unclear. Here, we identify Proline-Rich Transmembrane Protein 2 (PRRT2) as a native regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation. We show that PRRT2 facilitates the entry of Nav channels into slow-inactivated state and delays their recovery, a regulatory effect conserved from zebrafish to humans. PRRT2 forms molecular complexes with Nav channels both in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse cortex, PRRT2 deficiency impairs the slow inactivation of Nav channels in neuronal axons, leading to reduced cortical resilience in response to hyperexcitable challenges. Together, these findings establish PRRT2 as a physiological modulator of Nav channel slow inactivation and reveal a mechanism that supports cortical resilience to pathological perturbations.",

    "content": "Psychopathy, a condition characterized by profound emotional and interpersonal deficits, has long been hypothesized to stem, in part, from structural brain abnormalities. Yet, neuroimaging findings remain inconsistent. To address these discrepancies, we applied a novel structural network mapping approach combined with cross-species analyses. Traditional meta-analysis revealed weak spatial convergence across 20 samples. Nevertheless, we found that heterogeneous peak locations coalesced into a distributed set of regions encompassing the insular, and prefrontal cortices. This network overlapped strikingly (r = .93) with a lesion-derived network causally linked to antisocial behaviour, and variation within it predicted volumetric risk scores in both humans (n = 107, R2 = .16) and chimpanzees (n = 148, R2 = .21). These findings suggest that psychopathy reflects abnormalities across a collection of distributed regions rather than isolated areas, providing a unifying explanation for decades of inconsistent results and advancing our understanding of its clinical, biological, and evolutionary bases.",

    "title": "Tmem117, an oligodendrocyte-enriched regulator of NCX activity, links myelin homeostasis to counterregulation and metabolic health.",
    "content": "The counterregulatory response (CRR) to hypoglycemia is a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanism orchestrated by the central nervous system (CNS) to ensure survival during glucose scarcity. In individuals with diabetes, this response is frequently impaired, contributing to life-threatening episodes of hypoglycemia. Tmem117 was previously identified in a genetic screen as a promising hypothalamic regulator of CRR. Our previous work highlighted its contribution to CRR through regulation of vasopressin secretion. Here, we reveal that Tmem117 is also enriched in cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage and we characterize the contribution of oligodendrocytic Tmem117 in CRR. We show that depletion of Tmem117 from either all oligodendrocyte lineage cells or only mature oligodendrocytes leads to myelin deficits and male-specific defects in CRR. Furthermore, we reveal that transient, adult-onset depletion of Tmem117 in mature oligodendrocytes is sufficient to induce long-lasting metabolic imbalances in male mice, suggesting that defects in oligodendrocytes and myelin can affect peripheral glucose homeostasis. Mechanistically, we provide for the first-time insights on the function of Tmem117 showing that it regulates intracellular calcium dynamics through its interaction with the sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1. Together, these results redefine our understanding of the cellular contributors to the CRR, highlight the importance of oligodendrocytes in systemic glucose regulation, and position Tmem117 as a promising molecular target for cell-specific manipulation of NCX activity.",

    "title": "Temporal basis function models for closed-loop neural stimulation",
    "content": "Objective. Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Further advancements are required to address a number of difficulties with translating AI to this domain, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. Approach. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials measured in two non-human primates. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient ( \u2009min of training data), rapid to train ( \u2009min), and low latency ( \u2009ms) on desktop CPUs. Main results. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. Surprisingly, on test sets it achieved a prediction accuracy 44% higher than a complex nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and 158% higher than a linear state-space model requiring 90\u2009min to train. Additionally, in two simulations we show that it successfully allows a closed-loop stimulator to drive neural trajectories, and to achieve the user-preferred trade-offs between under- and over-stimulation, given the uncertainty in the model; it achieves an area under curve of \u223c0.7 in both cases. Significance. By optimizing for sample efficiency, training time, and latency, our approach begins to bridge the gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Dynamical models reveal distance to criticality in ageing brain dynamics.",
    "content": "Understanding how the brain changes with age remains a central question in neuroscience. Here, we combine magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from young and older adults with a whole-brain dynamical model to explore how brain dynamics evolve across the lifespan. Using a network of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators constrained by empirical structural connectivity, we systematically vary three model parameters to identify the settings that best reproduce alpha-band features observed in MEG data. Our findings reveal age-related shifts in these model parameters: older individuals exhibit stronger global coupling and more positive values of the bifurcation parameter, consistent with a transition to a supercritical regime. These results align with prior work suggesting altered excitation-inhibition balance in ageing and indicate a systematic reconfiguration of whole-brain dynamics. By situating empirical observations within a dynamical systems framework, this study provides a principled approach for quantifying the brains distance to criticality and lays the groundwork for future clinical applications.",

    "title": "Using Propensity Score Matching to Control for MRI Scan Quality",
    "content": "Movement during MRI scanning complicates distinguishing between the different tissues in the brain (e.g., grey and white matter). Standard practice excludes scans based on researcher-determined visual quality thresholds. Unfortunately, children, elderly, and clinical populations are shown to move more, resulting in higher exclusion rates. This disproportionate exclusion creates systematic bias in the literature and makes research findings less generalizable. Furthermore, the artifacts caused by motion are demonstrated to continue to confound data, even after visual quality control has occurred. We aimed to minimize the confounding factor of systematic group differences in movement. To achieve this, we used a post-scanning statistical technique called propensity score matching (PSM) that matches control and patient populations on scan quality metrics, leading to more comparable groups, greater inclusion, and more generalizable results. We found that PSM can attenuate significant differences in scan quality between groups while allowing for greater sample diversity than standard exclusion protocols. Crucially, using PSM can also alter the results of neuroimaging-based analyses. Using three datasets (total n = 1536), we compared voxel based morphometry analyses based on different quality control protocols. In particular, we observed discrepant results between PSM and strict threshold exclusion, with PSM magnifying some regional group differences and diminishing others.

    "title": "Dopamine receptor sensitivity and Pavlovian conditioned approach",
    "content": "Understanding the determinants of individual differences in cue-reactivity and drug sensitivity is critical to identifying neurobiological mechanisms underlying vulnerability to addiction. In this study, we examined the relationship between dopamine D1 and D2 receptor sensitivity and the attribution of incentive salience to reward cues and sensitivity to cocaine. Male Sprague Dawley rats were classified as having high or low sensitivity to the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole, and a subset was tested with the D1 receptor agonist SKF 82958. Cue-reactivity was assessed using a Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA) task, which distinguishes between sign-tracking (approach to a cue that predicts reward) and goal-tracking (approach to the site of reward delivery). Cocaine sensitivity was measured by locomotor activity and 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), a putative measure of appetitive states. High D2 responders exhibited more sign-tracking and greater cocaine-induced USVs than low responders despite no difference in cocaine-induced locomotion. Sign-trackers also showed greater locomotor sensitivity to D1 receptor stimulation than goal-trackers and produced more cocaine-induced USVs. Rats with high sensitivity to both D1 and D2 receptor stimulation showed the strongest sign-tracking behavior and affective response to cocaine. These findings suggest that dopamine receptor sensitivity is associated with the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues and potentially the appetitive effects of cocaine. This dopaminergic phenotype may reflect a mechanism contributing to both individual differences in cue-reactivity and drug responsiveness.",

    "content": "Tracking neuronal voltage changes using fluorescent voltage indicators is rapidly reshaping neuroscientific research. Voltage imaging enables direct visualization of electrical signals from subcellular compartments to large-scale networks, yet requires sophisticated image-analysis procedures. Here, we present a comprehensive study of current voltage imaging analysis pipelines and discuss the experimental conditions for which they are most suitable. We compare strengths and limitations of these pipelines in motion correction, denoising and segmentation routines, and discuss how different signal processing strategies can influence data integrity and interpretation. Our results show that most real-time analyses require GPU accelerated algorithms and that denoising prior to signal processing is needed for analysis of subcellular dynamics. We conclude that voltage imaging analyses needs to be tailored to different experimental settings: we propose a decision-tree to determine analysis strategies for diverse experimental conditions. Together, these insights pave the way for reproducible, high-fidelity voltage imaging studies.",

    "title": "Study of Sex Differences in the Whole Brain White Matter Using Diffusion MRI Tractography and Suprathreshold Fiber Cluster Statistics",
    "content": "Sex-specific characteristics demonstrate a substantial influence on the human brain white matter, suggesting distinct brain structural connectivity patterns between females and males. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is an important tool in assessing white matter connectivity and brain tissue microstructure across different populations. Whole brain white matter analysis using dMRI tractography for group statistical comparison is a challenging task due to the large number of white matter connections. In this work, we study whole-brain white matter connectivity differences between females and males using dMRI tractography. We study a large cohort of 707 healthy adult subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. By applying a well-established fiber clustering pipeline and a suprathreshold fiber cluster statistical method, we evaluated tracts in the cerebral cortex, as well as those connecting to regions such as the cerebellum, which have been relatively less studied using dMRI tractography. We identified several tracts that differed significantly between females and males in terms of their fractional anisotropy and/or mean diffusivity. These included several deep white matter tracts (e.g., arcuate fasciculus, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum) that have been previously shown to have sex differences, as well as superficial white matter tracts in the frontal lobe. However, there were relatively few cortical association tracts that exhibited significant sex differences. We also identified cerebellar tracts with sex differences. Finally, correlation analysis revealed that these white matter differences were linked to a range of neurobehavioral measures, with the strongest and most consistent associations observed for motor function. Overall, these findings provide characterizations of sex differences in the white matter and indicate that the circuits underlying motor function may be an important focus of future work on sex differences in the human brain.",

    "content": "Background: Ambient air pollution exposure is associated with structural brain differences and poorer cognition in children; however, mechanisms of toxicity remain unclear. Perivascular spaces (PVS), key for brain waste clearance, may play a role in the neurotoxicity of air pollution. This study explored associations between air pollution exposure, PVS morphology, and cognition in preadolescents. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study data from 6,949 9-10-year-old participants. Annual average exposures to PM2.5, O3, NO2, and 15 PM2.5 components were estimated using spatiotemporal models mapped to residential addresses. PVS count and volume were derived from T1w and T2w MRI, and cognition was estimated using NIH Toolbox scores. Linear mixed-effects models examined independent associations between air pollution, PVS, and cognition; weighted quantile sum regression assessed co-exposure effects of PM2.5 mixtures. Findings: Linear models revealed that exposures to Zn, NH4+, and Br were positively associated with PVS count in several regions. Higher PVS count in five key regions was associated with poorer cognitive performance across several NIH Toolbox domains. Higher Ca, Zn, and NH4+ exposures were associated with poorer cognition (PFDR < 0.01). Higher frontal lobe PVS count mediated the association between Zn exposure and poorer total cognition (P < 0.01). Co-exposure models revealed that PM2.5 mixtures were associated with higher temporal and cingulate PVS count, and poorer working memory and crystallized intelligence (P < 0.01). Interpretation: Outdoor air pollution was associated with higher PVS count and reduced cognition, suggesting that brain clearance may be a novel mechanism linking pollution to neurodevelopmental harm in preadolescents.",

However, few studies have investigated the neurophysiological basis that support these different encoding strategies across individuals. The present work addresses this gap by extending our previous findings on the direct relationship between cortical spectral power, measured via resting-state magnetoencephalography, and performance on standard cognitive test results. Our results highlight the complex interactions between endogenous brain oscillations, learning and verbal encoding strategies assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-2). First, we found that resting-state theta oscillations were significantly associated with verbal learning and subjective clustering strategies. Second, we observed that semantic clustering is facilitated by oscillatory patterns in left sensory-motor brain regions. Finally, our analyses revealed that serial and semantic clustering strategies are related to opposite regression patterns, indicating a competitive interaction. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the neural oscillatory dynamics that support diverse encoding strategies in verbal learning.",

    "content": "Aging is associated with declines in both motor and cognitive functions, which are well captured by dual task gait paradigms. However, the functional brain network mechanisms supporting motor and cognitive aspects of dual task performance in aging remain unclear. We examined 40 older adults (50 to 80 years) and 20 younger adults (20 to 40 years) who performed a motor single task (pedaling), a cognitive single-task (Go/NoGo), and a combined cognitive motor dual task during functional magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) using a custom-built MRI compatible pedaling device. Behaviorally, older adults showed significant dual task costs in motor performance, while cognitive performance was preserved. Neurally, older adults showed selective increases in connectivity within executive and motor-planning regions of cognitive networks, consistent with compensatory recruitment, whereas motor networks underwent broader reorganization, with strengthened frontoparietal control circuits but weakened cerebello-parietal and sensorimotor pathways. Multivariate analyses further revealed age related differences in latent connectivity behavior relationships: motor network patterns in older adults were more dispersed, reflecting heterogeneous reorganization, whereas cognitive-network patterns were more overlapping across groups, suggesting relative preservation. These findings suggest that aging involves a domain specific balance of resilience and vulnerability across brain networks and highlight motor-network adaption as a promising target for understanding why some older adults maintain function while others decline.",

    "content": "Much focus has shifted towards understanding how glial dysfunction contributes to age-related neurodegeneration due to the critical roles glial cells play in maintaining healthy brain function. Cell-cell interactions, which are largely mediated by cell-surface proteins, control many critical aspects of development and physiology; as such, dysregulation of glial cell-surface proteins in particular is hypothesized to play an important role in age-related neurodegeneration. However, it remains technically difficult to profile glial cell-surface proteins in intact brains. Here, we applied a cell-surface proteomic profiling method to glial cells from intact brains in Drosophila, which enabled us to fully profile cell-surface proteomes in-situ, preserving native cell-cell interactions that would otherwise be omitted using traditional proteomics methods. Applying this platform to young and old flies, we investigated how glial cell-surface proteomes change during aging. We identified candidate genes predicted to be involved in brain aging, including several associated with neural development and synapse wiring molecules not previously thought to be particularly active in glia. Through a functional genetic screen, we identified one surface protein, DIP-{beta}, which is down-regulated in old flies and can increase fly lifespan when overexpressed in adult glial cells. We further performed whole-head single-nucleus RNA-seq, and revealed that DIP-{beta} overexpression mainly impacts glial and fat cells. We also found that glial DIP-{beta} overexpression was associated with improved cell-cell communication, which may contribute to the observed lifespan extension. Our study is the first to apply in-situ cell-surface proteomics to glial cells in Drosophila, and to identify DIP-{beta} as a potential glial regulator of brain aging.",

We developed a video monitored behavioral platform with machine learning classifiers to unravel discrete changes in natural mouse behaviors. THC infusion into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) disrupted walking kinematic features characteristic of impairment responses. THC predominantly increased mPFC GABAergic activity preceding walk initiation shifting the mPFC excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. Pose-defined closed loop photo-stimulation of mPFC GABAergic neurons demonstrated that THC exacerbates selected parameters of motor impairment. Surprisingly, THC also induced a time locked, movement-induced, transient potentiation of mPFC endocannabinoid (eCB) release and ensuing CB1R-mediated synaptic inhibition. Here we establish that THC-modifies mPFC E/I balance to excitation via dynamic changes in eCB release which acts to induce behavioral impairment.",

    "title": "Beta bursts mediate amygdala gating of hippocampal emotional encoding",
    "content": "The amygdala and hippocampus are central to emotional processing, yet the transient neural dynamics coordinating these regions remain unclear. We simultaneously recorded single-neuron activity and local field potentials from both regions in epilepsy patients during an emotional image-rating task. Neurons in both regions responded to images with firing rate changes that predicted subjective ratings of extreme pleasantness or unpleasantness. To examine the underlying oscillatory mechanisms, we analyzed beta bursts (13-30 Hz)-transient, high-power events-since conventional spectral analyses revealed no valence-specific patterns. Beta bursts were associated with increased gamma amplitude and enhanced phase coherence in both structures, with beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling capturing emotion-related dynamics. Critically, amygdala beta bursts strongly suppressed hippocampal firing through interneuron activation during negative valence processing, whereas hippocampal bursts showed no reciprocal influence. These findings suggest that beta bursts provide a temporal code for emotion and represent a candidate mechanism for targeted neuromodulation in mood disorders.",

    "title": "Local thalamic interneurons drive spindle termination and enable sleep-dependent learning",
    "content": "The thalamus is central to fundamental brain functions including sensation, attention, and sleep through the precise generation and regulation of neuronal ensemble oscillatory activity. Sensory thalamic circuits are considered feedforward structures, lacking lateral connectivity, while recurrence in the network is mediated by interactions with inhibitory neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Here, we define previously uncharacterized functional roles of local thalamic interneurons, a component of the sensory thalamus whose function has remained unexplored. We demonstrate that local interneuron activation induces rebound oscillations in thalamocortical relay neurons ex vivo and neocortical spindles in vivo, while their inhibition increases spindle occurrence, overall spindle duration and impairs sensory learning. Our findings reveal that local thalamic interneurons have shared and complementary functions to those of thalamic reticular neurons and are required for proper spindle formation and sleep-dependent learning. Together, this work establishes an important neural substrate of thalamocortical circuit function.",

    "title": "Dscam1 Controls Presynaptic Terminal Size to Regulate Synaptic Structure and Function in a Central Motor Circuit",
    "content": "The Drosophila giant fiber system is a well-characterized escape circuit that enables precise investigation of synaptic development and function. Here, we examined the role of the cell adhesion molecule Dscam1 in shaping presynaptic architecture and supporting circuit performance. Using RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dscam1 in giant fiber interneurons, we observed reduced presynaptic terminal volume, smaller synapse interfaces, and reduced levels of electrical (Shak-B) and chemical (Bruchpilot) synaptic proteins. Despite this reduction in overall abundance, protein localization and density remained unchanged. Functionally, Dscam1 knockdown impaired circuit performance, both increasing latency and reducing success at high frequency demand. Correlation and principal component analysis of our data set show that anatomical variables, particularly presynaptic terminal size, best predicted circuit output. These findings identify Dscam1 as a key developmental regulator of presynaptic terminal size, linking early axon terminal elaboration to adult synaptic function in a central motor circuit. More broadly, our results exemplify a volumetric scaling model where available presynaptic area constrains the distribution of synaptic proteins, both electrical and chemical.",

    "content": "Creativity is central to human innovation, yet it often fluctuates from moment to moment. Identifying simple interventions to reliably boost creativity has broad scientific and societal value. Here, we tested whether short-pulse oxygen inhalation enhances creative problem-solving. Sixty participants performed two established tasks: the Alternative Uses Test (AUT), capturing divergent idea generation, and the Fusion Innovation Test (FIT), assessing both divergent and convergent thinking. Oxygen (~40% FiO2) was delivered in 1-minute pulses at 3-4-minute intervals, designed to align with intrinsic brain flexibility rhythms. Responses were scored for novelty, feasibility, and goal attainment using a validated GPT-based method. Linear mixed-effects regression revealed that oxygen significantly enhances both the quality and quantity of creative ideas across tasks. These findings demonstrate that a safe, low-cost physiological intervention can augment creative performance, providing a new link between oxygen metabolism, neural flexibility, and problem-solving.",

    "title": "Depression reduces structurally informed network flexibility in premanifest Huntington's disease",
    "content": "Objective: The extent to which structural connectivity constrains effective connectivity in both depression and neurodegenerative contexts remains poorly understood. In particular, the relationship between structural connectivity aberrations and effective dysconnectivity associated with depression in Huntingtons disease remains uncharacterized. Here, we applied a novel procedure that implements structural connectivity-informed spectral dynamic causal modelling to examine how structural connectivity shapes directed inter-regional influences in premanifest Huntingtons disease gene expansion carriers (HDGECs) with and without depression history. Method: Using spectral dynamic causal modeling embedded in a hierarchical empirical Bayes framework, we analyzed fMRI data from 98 premanifest HDGECs across default mode network and striatum (caudate and putamen). HDGECs were split into two groups based on either having a history of depression or not, and depression severity on both the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd Edition (BDI-II) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Depression Subscale (HADS-D) was used to measure clinically elevated depression symptoms. Leave-one-out cross-validation was implemented to test predictive validity. Results: Model evidence substantially favored structurally informed over uninformed approaches across all participants. For HDGECs, having a history of depression was associated with reduced baseline variability in effective connectivity (decreased  parameter), with particularly tight regularization of near-zero-valued structural connections toward zero effective connectivity values while leaving strongly connected pathways relatively unaffected. Effects converged on striatal self-connectivity and hippocampal-striatal pathways, with distinct patterns emerging between depression history groups. Notably, clinically elevated depression revealed differential connectivity signatures, with right caudate self-connectivity showing positive correlations with clinical cut-offs for HDGECs with and without depression history. In leave-one-out cross-validation, specific connections including DMN-to-striatum (BDI: r = -0.31, p = .002; HADS-D: r = -0.33, p = .001), right hippocampus-to-left caudate (BDI: r = -0.46, p < .001; HADS-D: r = -0.30, p = .002), and left caudate-to-left putamen (BDI: r = -0.48, p < .001; HADS-D: r = -0.30, p = .003) significantly predicted individual differences in depression severity scores. Conclusion : Together, these findings link reduced network flexibility to depression vulnerability in premanifest neurodegeneration, providing a mechanistic bridge between anatomical constraints, effective connectivity alterations, and clinical depression phenotypes.",

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "content": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the endothelial gene-regulatory programs involved remain incompletely understood. We integrate postmortem human single-nucleus transcriptomics with iPSC-based BBB models to define a conserved, inflammation-driven pathway that compromises barrier integrity. We identify an NF-KB-associated endothelial gene module endoM2 that is elevated in AD, inversely correlated with cognition, and enriched for inflammation and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition signatures. Cytokine stimulation of iPSC-derived brain endothelial cells induces morphological remodeling, lipid accumulation, junctional disruption, and transcriptomic shifts that mirror endoM2. A targeted drug screen identifies the NF-KB inhibitor BAY11-7082 as protective against cytokine-induced changes. In our perfusable iPSC-derived BBB-Chip that recapitulates human BBB signatures, single-cell profiling reveals inflammatory endothelial state-specific programs reflecting those in AD brains and demonstrates that BAY11-7082 suppresses cytokine-triggered dysfunction and reverses inflammation-associated gene activation. Together, these findings position cerebrovascular inflammation as a therapeutic target to preserve BBB integrity in AD.",

    "content": "AgRP neurons cause hunger, the drive to seek and consume food. Their activation by fasting is key for survival and is thought to be triggered by feedback when energy stores are low. However, we know that environmental cues can also regulate AgRP neurons, since cues that predict future food intake rapidly inhibit AgRP neurons. But is the converse true: can the prediction of future fasting rapidly activate AgRP neurons? Here we show that such rapid fasting activation of AgRP neurons does occur. This fasting response is driven by excitatory input from paraventricular hypothalamic neurons expressing Sim2, which are bidirectionally sensitive to predictions of future energy state. In this way, cognitively-processed contextual information conveyed by PVH-Sim2 neurons strongly activates AgRP neurons. Lastly, chronic silencing of PVH-Sim2 neurons causes persistent hypophagia. This PVH-Sim2 to AgRP neuron circuit, by anticipating and preventing negative energy balance, provides an important new dimension of hunger regulation.",

    "content": "Alpha-band neural oscillations (8-13 Hz) are theorized to phasically inhibit visual processing based, in part, on results showing that pre-stimulus alpha phase predicts detection (i.e., hit rates). However, recent failures to replicate and a lack of a mechanistic understanding regarding how alpha impacts detection have called this theory into question. We recorded EEG while six observers (6,020 trials each) detected near-threshold Gabor targets embedded in noise. Using signal detection theory (SDT) and reverse correlation, we observed an effect of occipital and frontal pre-stimulus alpha phase on sensitivity (d'), not criterion. Hit and false alarm rates were counterphased, consistent with a reduction in internal noise during optimal alpha phases. Perceptual reports were also more consistent when two identical stimuli were presented during the optimal phase, suggesting a decrease in internal noise rather than signal amplification. Classification images revealed sharper spatial frequency and orientation tuning during the optimal alpha phase, implying that alpha phase shapes sensitivity by modulating sensory tuning towards relevant stimulus features.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "Anomalous experiences are associated with high subconscious connectedness.",
    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

    "title": "Spatial and Temporal Factors Influencing Fixational Saccades",
    "content": "<p>Much research has focused on how perceptual, cognitive, and attentional processes modulate microsaccades, the small rapid gaze shifts that humans perform when attempting to maintain steady gaze on a point. Yet the reasons why these fixational saccades occur in the first place have remained unclear. Long-standing theories have argued for either spatial (i.e., gaze centering) or temporal mechanisms (i.e., a periodical release process). However, this debate has never been resolved, primarily because of uncertainty in determining where the observer looks. Whereas modern eye-trackers enable detection of small eye movements, accurate localization of the line of sight remains challenging. Here, rather than indirectly inferring gaze position from oculomotor activity, we used a gaze-contingent procedure to directly estimate the perceived center of the visual field, a method that has been previously shown to effectively reduce uncertainty. Our results from subjects of both sexes show that the generation of fixational saccades depends on the interaction of spatial and temporal factors. Fixational saccades are remarkably accurate in correcting for fixation errors, even when gaze is minimally displaced. However, fixational saccades also occur when gaze is centered, but their latency increases as the fixation error decreases. These results suggest that fixational saccades serve an important corrective function when needed, but they can only be avoided for a limited period of time when fixation is already accurate.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The human brain must add information to the acoustic speech signal in order to understand language. Many accounts propose that the prosodic structure of utterances (including their syllabic rhythm and speech melody), in combination with stored lexical knowledge, cue and interact with higher order abstract semantic and syntactic information. While cortical rhythms, particularly in the delta and theta band, synchronize to quasi-rhythmic low-level acoustic speech features, it remains unclear how the human brain encodes abstract speech properties in neural rhythms in the absence of an acoustic signal, i.e., when speakers hold planned sentences in working memory. This study disentangles the contributions of prosodic and syntactic features in cortical rhythms during delayed sentence repetition. Using high-resolution ECoG during awake tumor surgery in the left perisylvian cortex in nine patients (five female), we show that the phase of neural rhythms with frequencies ranging from 1 to 48&nbsp;Hz and the broadband gamma power envelope code both low-level acoustic and abstract syntactic speech features during sentence processing and retention. Syntax and prosody coding occurred in the same frequency bands, which argues against the assumption of different frequency channels for processing and representing these speech features. Our data suggest the brain leverages the phase of various neural rhythms to code both acoustic and abstract linguistic features.</p>",

    "title": "Hierarchical Organization of Human Visual Feature Attention Control",
    "content": "<p>Attention can be deployed in advance of visual stimuli based on features such as color or direction of motion. This anticipatory feature-based attention involves top-down neural control signals from the frontoparietal network that bias visual cortex to enhance attended information and suppress distraction. For example, anticipatory attention control can enable effective selection based on stimulus color while ignoring distracting information about stimulus motion. Anticipatory attention can also be focused more narrowly, for example, to select specific colors or motion directions that define task-relevant aspects of the stimuli. One important question that remains open is whether anticipatory attention control first biases broad feature dimensions such as color versus motion before biasing the specific feature attributes (e.g., blue vs green). To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity during a task where human participants of either sex were cued to either attend to a motion direction (up or down) or a color (blue or green) on a trial-by-trial basis. Applying multivariate decoding approaches to the EEG alpha band activity (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) during attention control (cue-target interval), we observed significant decoding for both the attended dimensions (motion vs color) and specific feature attributes (up vs down; blue vs green). Importantly, the temporal onset of the dimension-level biasing (motion vs color) preceded that of the attribute-level biasing (up vs down and blue vs green). These findings demonstrate that the top-down control of feature-based attention proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first biasing the broad feature dimension, and then narrowing to the specific feature attribute.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Aggressive behavior can be acquired through observation, providing adaptive advantages but also posing significant social risks. In humans, individuals repeatedly exposed to aggression are more likely to engage in violent behavior later in life. Yet, the environmental factors and neural mechanisms underlying observationally acquired aggression remain unclear. Here, we propose that social familiarity with an aggressor is critical for activating neural circuits in observers that primes aggression. To investigate this, we established a novel behavioral paradigm termed \"socially transmitted aggression (STA),\" in which witness mice observed either familiar or unfamiliar demonstrators attacking intruder mice. Remarkably, male, but not female, witnesses displayed increased aggression only after observing familiar demonstrators, with no effect from unfamiliar ones. Given that excitatory neurons in the posterior&ndash;ventral segment of the medial amygdala (MeApv) have been implicated in aggression priming, we hypothesized these neurons might be involved in STA as well. Supporting this hypothesis, fiber photometry revealed selective activation of excitatory MeApv neurons during familiar, but not unfamiliar, demonstrator attacks. Chemogenetically and optogenetically inhibiting these neurons suppressed STA, while activating them during unfamiliar demonstrator attacks promoted aggression. These results establish social familiarity as essential for the observational transmission of aggression and identify excitatory MeApv neurons as critical mediators of this phenomenon, offering potential avenues for clinical intervention.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Perisynaptic astroglia provide critical molecular and structural support to regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in the nanodomain of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM) was used to investigate relationships between perisynaptic astroglia and dendritic spine synapses undergoing plasticity in the adult hippocampus. Delta-burst stimulation (DBS) of the medial perforant pathway induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the middle molecular layer and concurrent long-term depression (cLTD) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in awake male rats. The contralateral hippocampus received baseline stimulation as a within-animal control. Brains were obtained 30&nbsp;min or 2&nbsp;h after DBS onset. An automated 3DEM pipeline was developed to enable unbiased quantification of astroglial coverage at the perimeter of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Under all conditions, &gt;85% of synapses had perisynaptic astroglia processes within 120&nbsp;nm of some portion of the perimeter. LTP broadened the distribution of spine sizes while reducing the presence and proximity of perisynaptic astroglia near the axon&ndash;spine interface of large spines. In contrast, cLTD transiently reduced the length of the axon&ndash;spine interface perimeter without substantially altering astroglial apposition. The postsynaptic density was discovered to be displaced from the center of the axon&ndash;spine interface, with this offset increasing during LTP and decreasing during cLTD. Astroglial access to the postsynaptic density was diminished during LTP and enhanced during cLTD, in parallel with changes in spine size. Thus, access of perisynaptic astroglia to synapses is dynamically modulated during LTP and cLTD alongside synaptic remodeling.</p>",

    "title": "Strengthening Medial Olivocochlear Feedback Reduces the Developmental Impact of Early Noise Exposure",
    "content": "<p>The early onset of peripheral deafness significantly alters the proper development of the auditory system. Likewise, exposure to loud noise during early development produces a similar disruptive effect. Before hearing onset in altricial mammals, cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that drives auditory circuit development. This activity is modulated by medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent feedback through &alpha;9&alpha;10 nicotinic cholinergic receptors in IHCs. In adults, these receptors are restricted to outer hair cells, where they mediate MOC feedback to regulate cochlear amplification. Although the MOC system's protective role to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in adulthood is well established, its influence during early developmental stages&mdash;especially in response to exposure to loud noise&mdash;remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of MOC feedback during early postnatal development using &alpha;9 knock-out (KO) and &alpha;9 knock-in (KI) mice of either sex, which respectively lack or exhibit enhanced cholinergic activity. Our findings reveal that both increased and absent olivocochlear activity result in altered auditory sensitivity at the onset of hearing, along with long-range alterations in the number and morphology of ribbon synapses. Early noise exposure caused lasting auditory damage in both wild-type and &alpha;9KO mice, with deficits persisting into adulthood. In contrast, &alpha;9KI mice were protected from noise-induced damage, with no long-term effects on auditory function. These results highlight the increased susceptibility of the auditory system during early postnatal development. Moreover, they indicate that an enhanced MOC feedback shields the auditory system from noise damage during this period.</p>",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "title": "Fine-grained image classification using the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism",
    "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

    "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
    "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

    "title": "Systematic review of experimental studies in humans on transcranial temporal interference stimulation",
    "content": "Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation method aimed at reaching deeper brain regions than conventional techniques. However, many questions about its effects remain, requiring further experimental studies. This review consolidates the experimental literature on tTIS\u2019s effects in the human brain, clarifies existing evidence, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes future research directions to evaluate its potential. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published up to 27 January 2025. Eligible studies applied tTIS to the human brain and examined its effects on neural, behavioral, and clinical outcomes. Of 127 publications screened, 18 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were analyzed for design, stimulation target, parameters, control conditions, and outcome measures. Included studies exhibited low bias or minor concerns using the Cochrane RoB2 and ROBINS-I tools. Ten studies targeted cortical regions (motor, occipito-parietal, fronto-parietal), and eight probed subcortical sites (striatum, hippocampus, globus pallidus, caudate). Motor-cortex tTIS enhanced motor-network connectivity, though the effect was similar to that of transcranial direct current stimulation. Beta-band stimulation envelopes (20\u2009Hz) promoted learning-related plasticity, while gamma-band envelopes (70\u2009Hz) yielded immediate performance improvements. Occipito-parietal tTIS did not modulate alpha power. Preliminary deep-target findings are promising: 5 Hz hippocampal tTIS improved episodic recall, 100\u2009Hz striatal tTIS enhanced motor learning in older adults, and 100\u2009Hz hippocampal-entorhinal tTIS aided spatial navigation. Two fMRI studies confirmed network-specific modulation, although one raised concerns about using a fixed montage between individuals. Clinical evidence remains limited, with two Parkinson\u2019s pilots and one epilepsy study showing short-term benefits. Overall, tTIS shows potential to modulate human brain activity and behavior. However, current evidence is preliminary and predominantly focused on cortical rather than deep targets. Larger, well-controlled studies are needed to reliably determine whether tTIS can effectively engage subcortical structures and provide meaningful clinical benefits.",

    "content": "Objective. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) scan contains a muscle\u2019s detailed stimulus-activation information and thereby can be used for motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Due to the challenges in accurately obtaining the motor unit numbers from experimental CMAP scans, most existing MUNE methods rely on data fitting, which is time-consuming and requires manual operations. This study explored the feasibility of a neural network-based MUNE approach and proposes an end-to-end model for rapid estimation. Approach. We developed NNEstimation, a novel supervised learning framework based on a convolutional neural network, to estimate motor unit numbers from both synthetic and experimental CMAP scans. A probabilistic model with varied parameters was used to generate CMAP scans with diverse characteristics for neural network training. NNEstimation trained on synthetic data was directly tested on both synthetic and experimental data. Main results. Evaluations on synthetic CMAP scans demonstrate that NNEstimation achieves lower estimation error and shorter execution time than the conventional data fitting method, MScanFit. The accuracy of NNEstimation is influenced by motor unit numbers of CMAP scans and remains unaffected by noise levels, recorded amplitudes, or motor unit activation thresholds. Moreover, NNEstimation\u2019s estimates on experimental data are highly consistent with those of MScanFit. Significance. Although trained solely on synthetic CMAP scans, NNEstimation achieves estimation results comparable to those of the traditional algorithm on experimental data while significantly reducing execution time, demonstrating its potential for practical MUNE applications.",

Despite advances in seizure detection, existing methods often struggle with accurately capturing the complex and dynamic interactions between temporal, spatial, and spectral features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This leads to limitations in the detection accuracy and generalization across different datasets. Approach. To address these challenges, we propose global-local weighted attention (GLWA) model, which integrates temporal, spatial, and spectral features through a local-global attention mechanism. At the same time, GLWA effectively balances both global and local features, capturing comprehensive information from EEG signals to enhance seizure detection accuracy. Main results. Our proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 98.82% and 98.89% on the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the model\u2019s capability to effectively integrate these features, resulting in improved detection performance. Significance. Furthermore, we visualize the model\u2019s decision-making process to gain insights into the attention distribution across different brain regions and spectraluency bands, further emphasizing GLWA\u2019s potential in seizure detection. This work demonstrates the model\u2019s superior performance and interpretability, providing a robust approach for accurate and generalizable identification of seizures.",

    "content": "<p>During my teen years, I was crazy interested in programming. I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!<p>Forward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.<p>After graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low\u2014it was basically slave labor\u2014but it was decent by my country\u2019s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.<p>I worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.<p>I got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.<p>Now, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews\u2019 monthly \u201cWho is Hiring\u201d threads, but got nothing.<p>I am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don\u2019t know how viable that goal is now.<p>I am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.<p>What would you do if you were me? I\u2019m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45405977\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45405977</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

    "content": "<p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

    "content": "<p>Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) face an increased risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and stroke. While white matter (WM) lesions are frequently reported in patients with CAD, the effects on WM microstructure alterations remain largely unknown. We aimed to identify WM microstructural alterations in individuals with CAD compared with healthy controls (HC) and to examine their relationships with cognitive performance. Forty-three (43) patients with CAD (35 males and 8 females) and 36 HC (26 males and 10 females) aged 50 and older underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and multimodal 3&nbsp;T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A novel multivariate approach&mdash;the Mahalanobis distance (D2)&mdash;was used to quantify WM abnormalities as the amount of deviation from the HC reference group. D2 integrates multiple MRI-derived diffusion-weighted imaging, R1 relaxometry, and magnetization transfer imaging metrics, while accounting for covariance between metrics. Relationships between WM D2 and cognition (executive function and processing speed) were also assessed. Compared with HCs, patients with CAD had higher D2 values in the whole WM (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and in the right anterior and bilateral middle cerebral artery territories (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Myelin-sensitive metrics, particularly R1 relaxation rate and MT saturation, were the most important contributors to D2. Processing speed was positively associated with greater R1 in both the whole WM and left middle cerebral artery territory. These findings suggest that greater WM microstructural alterations observed in patients with CAD were mainly driven by differences in myelin content. These alterations may contribute to a heightened risk of cognitive impairment.</p>",

    "title": "Age-Related Positivity Bias in Emotion Recognition Is Linked to Lower Cognitive Performance and Altered Amygdala-Orbitofrontal Connectivity",
    "content": "<p>Changes in emotion recognition are observed in aging, in dementia, after brain lesions and as a function of mental health factors, such as depression. In aging, older adults have been argued to show a \"positivity bias,\" which has been associated with a relatively spared recognition accuracy for positive emotion and an increased tendency to label emotions as positive. This bias has been suggested to support mental well-being. However, it has also been found in association with cognitive decline and brain lesions. Here, we investigated the behavioral and brain correlates of this age-related positivity bias. We used multimodal brain imaging in a large group of human adults (<i>n</i> = 665, 333 females) drawn from a population-derived cohort across the lifespan, together with a psychometric analysis of an emotion recognition task using facial expressions. Beyond reductions in expression recognition accuracy, older adults showed increased perceptual thresholds for negative emotions and a reduced threshold for the positive emotion, even after accounting for general face recognition abilities. This positivity bias in labeling emotions was strongly associated with lower cognitive performance in older people, but not with (nonclinical) depressive symptoms. It was also associated with reduced gray matter volume in the bilateral anterior hippocampus&ndash;amygdala and increased functional connectivity between these regions and the orbitofrontal cortex. Together, age-related positivity bias is associated with cognitive decline and structural and functional brain differences. A positivity bias in emotion recognition may therefore reflect an early marker of neurodegeneration, a hypothesis that could be tested in future longitudinal studies.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Finding what you are looking for is a ubiquitous task in everyday life that relies on a two-way comparison between what is currently viewed and internal search goals held in memory. Despite a wealth of studies tracking visual verification among external contents of perception, complementary verification processes among internal contents of memory remain elusive. Building on a recently established gaze marker of internal visual focusing in working memory, we uncover the internal inspection process associated with confirming or dismissing potential search targets. We show how male and female human participants \"look back\" into working memory when faced with external stimuli that are perceived as potential targets and link such internal inspection to the time needed for visual verification. A direct comparison between visual verification among the contents of working memory or perception further revealed how verification in both domains engages frontal theta activity in scalp electroencephalography but also how mnemonic verification is slower to deploy than perceptual verification. This establishes internal verification as an integral component of visual search and provides new ways to look into this underexplored component of human search behavior.</p>",

    "content": "IntroductionThis study aims to utilize a DenseNet based deep learning framework to predict brain age in patients with Moyamoya disease (MMD), examining the relationship between brain age and disease severity to enhance diagnostic and prognostic capabilities.MethodsWe analyzed unenhanced MRI scans from 432 adult MMD patients and 565 normal controls collected between January 2018 and December 2022. Data preprocessing involved converting DICOM files to NIFTI format and labeling based on established diagnostic criteria. A DenseNet121 architecture, implemented using PyTorch, was employed to predict brain age. Statistical analyses included correlation assessments and comparisons between predicted brain age, chronological age, and MRA scores.ResultsThe predicted brain age for MMD patients was significantly higher than their chronological age, averaging 37.9 years versus 35.8 years (p < 0.01). For normal controls, predicted brain age matched chronological age at 36.5 years. Delta age (difference between predicted brain age and chronological age) was significantly elevated in MMD patients (p < 0.001) and positively correlated with MRA scores, indicating a link between arterial stenosis severity and accelerated brain aging.DiscussionThe DenseNet based model effectively predicts brain age, revealing that MMD patients experience accelerated brain aging correlated with disease severity. These findings highlight the potential of brain age prediction as a biomarker for MMD, aiding in personalized treatment strategies and early intervention. Future research should explore multi-center datasets and longitudinal data to validate and extend these findings.",

    "title": "Altered brain structural covariance networks of the thalamic subfields in right chronic capsular stroke",
    "content": "BackgroundThe thalamus, along with its component nuclei, possesses extensive connections with various brain regions and is engaged in diverse functions. However, it is unknown whether the gray matter volume (GMV) covariance networks of thalamic subfields are selectively affected in chronic capsular stroke.MethodsWe recruited 45 patients with chronic right capsular strokes (CS) and 93 normal controls (NC) from three centers. The thalamus was segmented into 25 subfields using FreeSurfer (v7.1.1). A general linear model was applied to investigate intergroup differences in the GMV covariance network of each thalamic subfield with each voxel of the entire brain between CS and NC, correcting for confounders such as age, gender, total intracranial volume (TIV), and scanners (voxel-wise p\u202f<\u202f0.001, cluster-wise FWE corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ResultsOur findings revealed that all 25 ipsilesional thalamic subfields in CS were atrophied (p\u202f<\u202f0.05, FDR correction). Among these, 16 ipsilesional thalamic subfields (including AV, LD, LP, VLa, VLp, VPL, VM, CeM, CL, MDm, LGN, PuM, PuI, CM, Pf, and Pt) exhibited significantly subfield-specific increased GMV covariance connectivity with the anterior orbital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, calcarine, anterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus, and other regions. Additionally, although none of the contralesional thalamic subfields demonstrated regional GMV changes, 3/25 showed subfield-specific increased GMV covariance connectivity with the ipsilesional anterior orbital gyrus and subcortex.ConclusionThe GMV covariance networks of thalamic subfields are selectively involved in patients with chronic capsular stroke, which affect not only the ipsilesional thalamic subfields but also the contralesional ones.",

    "title": "Efficient spiking convolutional neural networks accelerator with multi-structure compatibility",
    "content": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) possess excellent computational energy efficiency and biological credibility. Among them, Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs) have significantly improved performance, demonstrating promising applications in low-power and brain-like computing. To achieve hardware acceleration for SCNNs, we propose an efficient FPGA accelerator architecture with multi-structure compatibility. This architecture supports both traditional convolutional and residual topologies, and can be adapted to diverse requirements from small networks to complex networks. This architecture uses a clock-driven scheme to perform convolution and neuron updates based on the spike-encoded image at each timestep. Through hierarchical pipelining and channel parallelization strategies, the computation speed of SCNNs is increased. To address the issue of current accelerators only supporting simple network, this architecture combines configuration and scheduling methods, including grouped reuse computation and line-by-line multi-timestep computation to accelerate deep networks with lots of channels and large feature map sizes. Based on the proposed accelerator architecture, we evaluated two scales of networks, named small-scale LeNet and deep residual SCNN, for object detection. Experiments show that the proposed accelerator achieves a maximum recognition speed of 1, 605 frames/s at a 100 MHz clock for the LeNet network, consuming only 0.65 mJ per image. Furthermore, the accelerator, combined with the proposed configuration and scheduling methods, achieves acceleration for each residual module in the deep residual SCNN, reaching a processing speed of 2.59 times that of the CPU with a power consumption of only 16.77% of the CPU. This demonstrates that the proposed accelerator architecture can achieve higher energy efficiency, compatibility, and wider applicability.",

Advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising tools for analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data to improve AD diagnosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of GNN applications in AD diagnosis, focusing on data sources, modalities, sample sizes, classification tasks, and diagnostic performance. Drawing on extensive literature searches across PubMed, IEEE Xplorer, Scopus, and Springer, we analyze key GNN frameworks and critically evaluate their limitations, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. In addition, we present a comparative analysis to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of GNN methods across different datasets, such as ADNI, OASIS, TADPOLE, UK Biobank, in-house, etc. Furthermore, we provide a critical methodological comparison across families of GNN architectures (i.e., GCN, ChebNet, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN, etc.) in the context of AD. Finally, we outline future research directions to refine GNN-based diagnostic methods and highlight their potential role in advancing AI-driven neuroimaging solutions. Our findings aim to foster the integration of AI technologies in neurodegenerative disease research and clinical practice.",

    "title": "Personalized temporal interference stimulation targeting striatum reduces functional stability and dynamic connectivity variability in the sensorimotor network",
    "content": "BackgroundFunctional stability within brain networks, particularly the sensorimotor network (SMN), is crucial for coherent motor control. Temporal Interference (TI) stimulation offers a non-invasive method to modulate deep brain structures like the striatum, yet its impact on dynamic functional stability across motor networks remains largely unexplored.MethodsTwenty-six healthy male participants separately underwent TI stimulation and Sham stimulation in a crossover, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with counterbalanced protocol. resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was acquired before and during the stimulation. A total of 20 min TI stimulation (10 mA, \u0394f = 20 Hz) was applied to the right striatum using personalized electrode montages optimized. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) was computed using a sliding-window approach. Voxel-wise functional stability across the whole brain was quantified by Kendall\u2019s concordance coefficient of voxel-to-voxel dFC. Seed-based dFC variability in the right striatum was measured as the standard deviation of dFC across windows.Results(1) Functional stability: TI stimulation significantly decreased functional stability in bilateral SMA regions (predominantly SMA proper, with parts of pre-SMA) compared to Sham and baseline conditions (P < 0.01). (2) Dynamic functional connectivity: TI stimulation reduced dFC variability between the right striatum and left SMA region (predominantly SMA proper, with parts of pre-SMA) compared to baseline (P < 0.01). (3) Safety: No adverse cognitive effects or side effects were observed, with good blinding effectiveness maintained throughout the study.ConclusionOur findings indicate that TI stimulation targeting the striatum effectively modulates sensorimotor network stability and dFC variability within the cortico-striatal pathway, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach for motor network disorders.Clinical trial registration[www.chictr.org.cn;], identifier [ChiCTR2500098699].",

    "title": "From zero- to few-shot: deep temporal learning of wrist EMG enables scalable cross-user gesture recognition",
    "content": "Objective. Wrist electromyography (EMG) is emerging as an enticing wearable input modality for human\u2013machine interaction. Traditionally recorded from the forearm for use in transradial prostheses, wrist-based EMG sensors are now being integrated into devices such as watches and wristbands for hand gesture recognition (HGR). Consumer familiarity with wrist-worn devices makes wrist EMG a compelling option, but the need for individualized user calibration remains a challenge. Approach. This study therefore evaluated various cross-user models to reduce the calibration burden and compared wrist- and forearm-based models. Eight different machine learning architectures were evaluated across 33 users, using varying amounts of data from the end user. Main results. A temporal convolutional network-bidirectional long short-term memory architecture, applied for the first time to EMG classification, was found to significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) outperform other tested machine learning architectures. An inter-day feature set combined with Z-score normalization achieved the best performance when classifying five gestures (plus a rest class) using either wrist or forearm EMG. Consistent with other recent results, wrist EMG consistently outperformed forearm EMG in all analyses, including within- and across-user comparisons (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In cross-user models, wrist EMG demonstrated a zero-shot performance of 78.2%, compared to 71.6% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Introducing one calibration repetition from the end user increased one-shot performance of wrist EMG to 91.6%, compared to 86.9% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Adding further training repetitions boosted wrist EMG performance to 98.3%, compared to 97.4% for forearm EMG. Significance. These findings provide new evidence supporting the viability of wrist EMG for cross-user HGR models that generalize to new users with minimal calibration, suggesting promising potential for its broader adoption in wearable devices.",

    "content": "Reliable synapse identification in volumetric EM is hampered by subtle, 3D cues that yield variable human judgments. We present a standardized proofreading protocol that pairs explicit, operational criteria with machine-learning candidate generation and a two-stage calibration of annotators. In two larval Drosophila melanogaster volumes imaged at 8x8x8 nm, five raters (expert + 4 calibrated annotators) reviewed model-proposed candidates using efficient node-based labels. Multi-rater judgments were aggregated with a probabilistic Dawid-Skene (DS) model to produce consensus labels with calibrated uncertainty. Post-calibration, individual annotator accuracy versus the expert improved (McNemar p<0.05 for all raters), DS-expert agreement increased, and DS posterior entropy decreased for true positives/negatives, indicating more decisive consensus; gains were modest and dataset-dependent in chance-corrected agreement (Krippendorff's ). By making uncertainty explicit, this protocol converts noisy judgments into auditable supervision suitable for training and evaluation, while honestly communicating residual ambiguity essential for reliable and robust connectomics at scale.",

    "title": "Effects of asymmetrical postural demands on sternocleidomastoid reflex in the startReact paradigm",
    "content": "IntroductionstartReact, the rapid release of a planned movement following a startling acoustic stimulus (usually >100 dB), is widely used to assess reticulospinal tract (RST) involvement in motor control. The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) reflex within 120 ms often identifies true startle responses, i.e., responses facilitated by RSTs in the absence of cortical control. However, as the SCM is a postural muscle, its reflexive activation may be influenced by inhibitory anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), particularly during tasks with greater head/neck postural demands.MethodsWe compared SCM activation during unilateral shoulder abduction (SABD) versus hand opening (OPEN) tasks. Due to the increased asymmetrical head/neck postural demands in SABD, we hypothesized an APA-induced delay in SCM activation during SABD compared to the OPEN task, with a contralateral bias due to contralateral cortical circuits triggering APAs.ResultsOur results revealed significantly longer SCM latency\u2014exceeding the 120 ms cutoff\u2014during SABD relative to OPEN. This suggested that APAs during postural tasks, resulting from unilateral SABD, altered the expression of the startReact response. To confirm this finding, we implemented an innovative, data-driven method to determine the appropriate SCM cutoff based on the physiological difference between startle-induced SCM reflexes and task-induced SCM activation. Using this method, we observed reduced contralateral SCM reflexive activation compared to ipsilateral, during SABD but not in OPEN.DiscussionThis provides evidence for the first time that SCM reflexive activation in startReact is posture-dependent. Our novel classification method offers a robust framework for identifying true startle responses across different tasks, offering broader applicability for studies investigating RST involvement in motor control.",

    "title": "When embodiment matters most: a confirmatory study on VR priming in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces training",
    "content": "BackgroundVirtual Reality (VR) feedback is increasingly integrated into Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, enhancing the Sense of Embodiment (SoE) toward virtual avatars and fostering more vivid motor imagery (MI). VR-based MI-BCIs hold promise for motor rehabilitation, but their effectiveness depends on neurofeedback quality. Although SoE may enhance MI training, its role as a priming strategy prior to VR-BCI has not been systematically examined, as prior work assessed embodiment only after interaction. This study investigates whether embodiment priming influences MI-BCI outcomes, focusing on event-related desynchronization (ERD) and BCI performance.MethodsUsing a within-subject design, we combined data from a pilot study with an extended experiment, yielding 39 participants. Each completed an embodiment induction phase followed by MI training with EEG recordings. ERD and lateralization indices were analyzed across conditions to test the effect of prior embodiment.ResultsEmbodiment induction reliably increased SoE, yet no significant ERD differences were found between embodied and control conditions. However, lateralization indices showed greater variability in the embodied condition, suggesting individual differences in integrating embodied feedback.ConclusionOverall, findings indicate that real-time VR-based feedback during training, rather than prior embodiment, is the main driver of MI-BCI performance improvements. These results corroborate earlier findings that real-time rendering of embodied feedback during MI-BCI training constitutes the primary mechanism supporting performance gains, while highlighting the complex role of embodiment in VR-based MI-BCIs.",

    "title": "The Death of Utilitarian Programming",
    "content": "<p>Utilitarian coding is defined as follows: <i>The code you write should be *directly* useful or serve the interest of at least one actual human being.</i> It might appear somewhat abstract or vague, so examples might help. For example, I don't consider <i>frameworks</i> as utilitarian code. What you create are like the \"frames\" of a picture box, someone else (the user) will take it and draw the actual picture. Though you did help with part of the process, it's indirect at best. You're part of the supply chain here, not part of the team.<p>A clever and witty bash script running on a unix server somewhere is also not utilitarian coding, no human ever directly benefited from it.<p>Libraries can be somewhat utilitarian, at least more than frameworks. At least they provide some reusable functionality to the user out of the box like logging, scanning a barcode, fetching data from a URL, etc. But again, a lot of indirection and little lasting time, what did *you* learn about implementation and life in that process my friend?<p>It's my strong belief that our life's purpose isn't just about learning technology but also other non-technical things in life (such as life itself). By compartmentalizing themselves into libraries, frameworks, specifications, package managers, build and tooling, etc, many coders over the last decade have sort of divorced themselves from the intricacies and interaction with life itself.<p>A decade ago from now (i.e. circa 2014-15) is where I'd say utilitarian coding came to an end. The kind of programming that prevailed until then (mostly desktop programming) was highly utilitarian in nature. You used to develop a Winforms App for the client, with actual textboxes, dropdowns and buttons, tailored to their specific requirements and domain knowledge, what could be more utilitarian than that! You used to gain domain expertise and not just technology expertise.<p>As things started moving to the cloud, the interaction between the end-user and programmer became less and less, that's when utilitarian coding started dying too. As a new breed of specialists called \"Agile Experts\", \"Scrum Masters\", \"Tech Advocates\", \"Thought Leaders\", etc. started inserting themselves between the coder and end user, the former's role started morphing as the ostrich policy of dealing only with technology and nothing else. We started losing touch with domain expertise, and became branded as \"python coder\", \"PHP scripter\", \"web developer\", \"AI developer\", etc. That's how folks started churning out more frameworks, libraries, packages, stencils, helper scripts, etc. instead of worrying about actual problem solving with the stakeholders.<p>This is how things stand right now for the most part, desktop development and other forms of utilitarian coding have still maintained their small niche somewhere, but they're just a niche. But it's not a healthy development, nor is it sustainable long term. I strongly feel that this bubble is waiting to burst one day soon, and there will be a reversion towards utilitarian coding again. Even the cloud itself needs to be more utilitarian, a lot of needless clutter out there which can be simplified.<p>What do you think? Let me know in comments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45404997\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45404997</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>",

This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022.

Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects.

We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample.

For teleoperation systems to replicate these real-life interactions, tactile sensation must be presented and distributed across the entire fingertip. Thus, understanding the distribution of tactile acuity at the fingertip is imperative. Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",

The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "title": "Mental pain, boredom, and diffuse nociception.",
    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

While RBD may occur idiopathically, it is frequently associated with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly \u03b1-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, secondary RBD linked to acute cerebrovascular events remains poorly documented. Here, we present a novel case of acute pontine infarction precipitating RBD, highlighting the brainstem\u2019s critical role in REM sleep regulation and expanding the spectrum of secondary RBD etiologies. This case report underscores the importance of neuroanatomical localization in evaluating acute-onset RBD, particularly in the context of cerebrovascular pathology.",

    "content": "IntroductionWhile lesion and neurophysiological animal studies point toward a notable involvement of subcortical pathways in the control of low back muscles, little attention has been dedicated to the subject in humans. The StartReact paradigm may allow to indirectly test the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system during motor control, thus addressing this gap of knowledge. In this study, we aimed to compare the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system in the control of low back muscles during voluntary (lumbar spine extension) and postural (upper limb movement eliciting anticipatory postural adjustment) tasks using the StartReact paradigm.MethodsThe reaction time (RT) of the lumbar erector spinae was measured within a simple precued RT task while conditioned by startling (SAS\u2014116\u202fdB) or non-startling (NSAS\u201480\u202fdB) acoustic stimuli.ResultsThe reduction in RT was similar during the postural and voluntary tasks. However, RT was more shortened with the SAS condition compared to the NSAS condition in both tasks. This finding was replicated using a cumulative distribution functions analysis.DiscussionFor the first time, a StartReact effect of back muscles was demonstrated during a voluntary task and was shown to be similar to that observed in a postural task. Therefore, these results suggest a contribution of the reticulospinal tract in the postural and voluntary control of back muscles in humans.",

    "title": "Association between neuroticism and physical activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysical activity has been shown to be associated with neuroticism, a personality trait reflecting emotional instability and a tendency toward negative emotions. Understanding this relationship is crucial for developing effective mental health interventions. However, the underlying mechanisms and the strength of this association remain insufficiently understood.ObjectiveThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the current research on the relationship between neuroticism and physical activity, analyze their correlations and moderating factors, and investigate the potential bidirectional mechanisms linking these two factors.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost for studies published between January 2000 and November 2024. We included English-language studies across all age groups that employed cross-sectional, longitudinal, or cohort designs. Studies focusing on special populations, non-peer-reviewed works, samples with fewer than 50 participants, non-empirical studies, and reviews were excluded. Data extraction was performed using standardized forms, and a meta-analysis was conducted in Stata 18 to assess heterogeneity and publication bias.ResultsAfter screening, 25 studies were included, comprising 15 Pearson correlation analyses and 12 multiple regression analyses. The meta-analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between physical activity and neuroticism, with an average correlation coefficient r = \u22120.141. This suggests that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower levels of neuroticism. Specifically, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for neuroticism inhibiting physical activity was \u22120.150, indicating that for every one standard deviation increase in neuroticism, physical activity decreases by approximately 0.150 standard deviation units. Conversely, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for physical activity affecting neuroticism was \u22120.113, suggesting a potential reduction in neuroticism with increased physical activity, although this effect was not statistically significant across the limited number of studies.ConclusionOur findings confirm a significant negative association between physical activity and neuroticism, highlighting the potential of physical activity as a strategy for improving mental health. However, establishing causality requires further verification through longitudinal and experimental designs. The results emphasize the need for personalized interventions targeting individuals with high neuroticism. Future research should prioritize diverse cultural samples, standardized measurement protocols, and mechanistic investigations of this bidirectional relationship to better understand the underlying processes and develop effective interventions.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251051360, identifier: CRD420251051360.",

    "content": "IntroductionSensorimotor integration is crucial role for goal-directed tasks, with sensorimotor mismatch impairing movement execution and potentially evoking anxiety. However, the relationship between mismatch-induced anxiety, movement precision, and automaticity remains unexplored. This study investigated the effect of sensorimotor mismatch on voluntary postural control during goal-directed tasks and the relationship between sensorimotor mismatch-induced anxiety and motor performance.MethodsTwenty-three young, injury-free adults performed a precision task requiring center of pressure (COP) control within a limited screen area under congruent (aligned visual inputs and motor outputs) and incongruent (180-degree mismatch between visual feedback and motor actions) conditions. Self-reported anxiety was assessed using a seven-point Likert scale. Motor performance was quantified using COP area, total path length and sample entropy of COP trajectory for movement precision and automaticity.ResultsSensorimotor mismatch significantly increased self-reported anxiety (p = 0.02) and reduced movement automaticity, evidenced by lower sample entropy values (p < 0.01). Higher anxiety scores were correlated with decreased movement automaticity in the medio-lateral direction (lower sample entropy) under the mismatch condition (r = \u22120.33, p = 0.008).DiscussionThese findings suggest that sensorimotor mismatch induces self-perceived anxiety and disrupts automatic motor control processes.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

    "title": "Toward accurate single image sand dust removal by utilizing uncertainty-aware neural network",
    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

We identified the top 100 most-cited articles published in each database from 2005 to 2025, merged and deduplicated the results, and selected the 100 most-cited papers on optic nerve regeneration. After extracting key details such as titles, authors, keywords, publication information, and institutional affiliations, a bibliometric analysis was conducted.ResultsThe top 100 most cited papers on optic nerve regeneration published between 2005 and 2025, accumulating 34,636 total citations with a median of 346 citations per paper. Prof. Zhigang He emerged as the most prolific author with 19 publications. The United States contributed 59 papers, while Harvard University led institutions with 30 publications. Key research themes included optic nerve regeneration, CNTF, gene therapy, and retinal ganglion cells.ConclusionOur analysis of top-cited optic nerve regeneration research reveals sustained United States leadership in output and innovation. Early work focused on neuronal signaling pathways (PTEN/mTOR, KLF family), while current studies explore novel targets and biomaterials. Global collaboration among the United States, China, and European nations has accelerated progress. Key challenges remain in achieving functional long-distance regeneration. Future direction should prioritize the development of multi-target therapeutic methods, precise drug delivery, and the control of inflammation to improve nerve regeneration efficiency.",

    "content": "Objective: There is a need for effective cognitive assessment tools to evaluate the development of very young children in resource-limited low- and middle-income country settings. Our objective was to evaluate the field usability of a computer-based attention test and its concurrent validity with a caregiver-reported screener of neurodevelopment in rural, Ecuadorian children. Method: To assess a computer-based attention test in a resource-limited setting, 41 Ecuadorian children between 2 and 4 years of age were evaluated once with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention adapted to eye-tracking instrumentation. To evaluate the validity of the ECVT, results were compared with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133, measured 3\u20134 times between 21 and 48 months of age. Results: ECVT measures were collected successfully for 97.6% of children (40/41), suggesting good field usability of the test in this resource-limited setting. An increase in 1 SD in child attention, as measured by the ECVT average fixation duration, was associated with a 7.9-point increase in the overall Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133 score (95% CI [1.5, 14.2], <em>p</em> = .015). Conclusions: A computer-based attention assessment in early childhood was usable in a resource-limited setting and predictive of a caregiver-reported screener of child neurodevelopment. The ECVT, therefore, can be used to assess the effects of early risk factors and resilience in brain/behavior development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index \u201cspeed\u201d potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. Method: The present study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children aged 8\u201312 with and without ADHD (<em>N</em> = 119). Results: There was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the <em>tau</em> parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD and among children with low working memory capacity (regardless of ADHD status). Variance in <em>tau</em> was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of adopting analytic methods that can more accurately describe performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here, we determine whether familiarizing individuals with self-appraisal with daily memory testing for 7 days provide a more accurate estimate of cognitive functioning and mood. Method: Two hundred twenty-five participants (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> \u00b1 <em>SD</em>: 74.1 \u00b1 8.3 years; 66% female; median education 16.0 years) completed the online Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health, which included two associative memory tasks, for seven consecutive days. Each day, participants self-appraised their performance. At baseline, they completed various cognitive and mood measures. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between task performance and self-appraisal on Days 1 and 7 and used linear models to examine the relationship between self-appraisal scores and clinical measures. Results: Accuracy (Day 1: 0.44 \u00b1 0.12; Day 7: 0.81 \u00b1 0.16) and self-appraisal (Day 1: 0.36 \u00b1 0.15; Day 7: 0.70 \u00b1 0.21) increased, as did the association between accuracy and self-appraisal, Day 1: correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [0.09, 0.34], <em>p</em> = .001; Day 7: <em>r</em> = 0.69, 95% CI [0.62, 0.76], <em>p</em> < .001. Self-appraisal scores on Day 7, but not Day 1, showed significant relationships with in-clinic measures. Conclusions: Repeated remote cognitive assessments may help elucidate individuals\u2019 capacities to refine their self-perception of cognitive performance during multiday learning. The weak association between accuracy and test-na\u00efve self-appraisal warrants caution about using this metric cross-sectionally. Experienced self-appraisal could be especially relevant at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when subtle learning difficulties emerge and could improve our capacity to detect early meta-cognitive changes.

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding?

In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychological norms serve to identify cognitive impairment and monitor neurodegenerative disease progression. However, longitudinal data are limited, and conventional approaches do not account for biomarkers to exclude underlying Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, reducing sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive decline in preclinical AD. To address these limitations, this research provides robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms derived from Spanish individuals with nonpathological levels of AD biomarkers. Method: We analyzed 3-year follow-up data from 350 cognitively unimpaired individuals (Alzheimer\u2019s and Families+ cohort). A subset of 228 individuals with normal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242/40, phosphorylated-tau181, and total-tau biomarkers defined the robust reference group. Neuropsychological assessment encompassed the Trail Making Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Memory Binding Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013IV, Wechsler Memory Scale\u2013IV, Semantic Fluency Test, and Judgment of Line Orientation from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Using the Reliable Change Index and Standardized Regression-Based methods, robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms were derived from the reference group. Validation analysis assessed the sensitivity of robust versus conventional normative procedures. Results: Models, equations, percentiles, and cutoffs for identifying significant cognitive decline were provided. Robust norms showed modestly greater sensitivity in certain measures, particularly in episodic memory. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: Total Free Delayed Recall showed the most notable result at the 5th percentile in Reliable Change Index (\u03c7\u00b2 = 16.06, <em>p</em> = 6.15E-05). Conclusions: Robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms may improve the detection of subtle cognitive decline, modestly enhancing sensitivity at the lower ends of distributions.

    "title": "Posttraumatic stress symptomatology rather than mild traumatic brain injury is related to atypical early neural processing during cognitive control.",
    "content": "Objective: Many veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) report disruptions in cognition; however, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these cognitive difficulties are not well understood. It is also unknown whether PTSD symptomatology or past mTBIs uniquely impact functions important to adaptation such as cognitive control. Method: We examined event-related potentials elicited by a flanker task to evaluate brain responses during conflict monitoring in a sample of 192 U.S. military veterans with combat-zone experience and exposure to explosive blasts. Clinical assessments characterized diagnoses as well as the severity of PTSD symptoms and mTBI so that we could parse overlapping syndromes and directly contrast effects of the two conditions. Results: Across groups, participants performed worse on conflict trials (Incongruent distractors), particularly when preceded by a no-conflict (Congruent distractors) trial. We found that greater dysphoric PTSD symptomatology was related to a reduced early perceptual response (P1), while greater avoidance PTSD symptomatology predicted a larger early visual attention response (N1). Although late cognitive processes (N2, P3) were sensitive to cognitive control demands of the flanker task, posttraumatic symptomatology and mTBI severity were unrelated to them. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the Avoidance and Dysphoria domains of PTSD symptomatology may differentially relate to early neural functions of perception and visual attention rather than later cognitive responses. Rehabilitation and treatment of individuals with PTSD and mTBI may be most productive when focused on perceptual and attentional processing, which could improve cognitive control.

We recently passed a new star milestone on GitHub, and I just wanted to say a huge <strong>thank you</strong> to everyone who has shown interest, offered feedback, or contributed. It means the world to me.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Ducky is a free, open-source desktop application that consolidates the essential tools of a network engineer or security enthusiast into a single, easy-to-use interface. Instead of juggling separate applications for terminal connections, network scanning, and diagnostics (like PuTTY, Angry IP Scanner, etc.), Ducky provides a unified workspace to streamline your workflow. Its core features include a tabbed terminal (SSH, Telnet, Serial), an SNMP-powered network topology mapper, a port scanner, and a suite of security utilities like a CVE lookup and hash calculator.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Ducky is built for anyone who works with network hardware and infrastructure. It's intended to be a serious, daily-use tool for professionals, but it's also simple enough for learners.</p> <ul> <li><strong>For Production:</strong> Network Engineers &amp; Administrators for daily tasks like configuring switches and routers, troubleshooting connectivity, and documenting network layouts. Cybersecurity professionals can also use it for reconnaissance and analysis.</li> <li><strong>For Learning:</strong> Students and hobbyists (e.g., studying for CompTIA Network+ or CCNA) can use Ducky as a free, hands-on tool to explore and interact with real or virtual network devices.</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Ducky aims to fill a gap between powerful but expensive commercial tools and single-function free utilities.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Compared to tools like SecureCRT or MobaXterm Pro:</strong> Ducky provides many of the most-used features (tabbed multi-protocol terminal, session management) but is completely free and open-source. While it doesn't have every advanced feature of those paid tools yet, it covers the daily essentials in a clean, modern interface.</li> <li><strong>Compared to using separate free tools (like PuTTY + Nmap + a separate subnet calculator):</strong> Ducky's main advantage is integration. The tools are designed to work together. For example, you can discover a device on the Topology Map, click it to see its details, and then launch an SSH session to it without ever leaving the application. This creates a much smoother and faster workflow.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How You Can Help:</strong></p> <p>The best way you can support the project right now is by giving it a star on GitHub! It provides a huge motivation boost and helps more people discover the tool.</p> <p><strong>Easy Download (No Python Needed!)</strong></p> <p>I've also launched a small website for the project. You can now download a <strong>pre-packaged .exe file</strong> directly from the site\u2014no need to install Python or any dependencies.</p> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub Repository (Please leave a star! \u2b50):</strong> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fthecmdguy%2FDucky\">https://github.com/thecmdguy/Ducky</a></li> <li><strong>Website with Direct Download:</strong> <a href=\"https://ducky.ge/#download\">ducky.ge</a></li> </ul> <p>Thank you all again for the support</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/initCMD\"> /u/initCMD </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nsj4cy/ducky_a_free_opensource_allinone_networking/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nsj4cy/ducky_a_free_opensource_allinone_networking/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Acquired crowding dyslexia: A peripheral reading deficit other than neglect dyslexia.",
    "content": "Objectives: Crowding refers to the phenomenon whereby small visual objects above the acuity threshold are detected but unrecognizable when surrounded by nearby stimuli. It affects reading in healthy individuals and can be enhanced in reading impairments. By increasing the interletter space, crowding decreases. Previous evidence on patients with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and peripheral dyslexia has shown a dissociation in sensitivity to spacing manipulation between those who mainly produced omissions and those characterized by substitutions in reading. Here, we wanted to verify the hypothesis that the reading impairment mainly characterized by substitutions is dissociated from USN, unlike the one characterized by omissions. Method: In a retrospective study, we collected 38 right-brain-damaged patients, 21 with USN. We analyzed the number and types of errors in reading single words and pseudowords, spaced and unspaced, comparing patients with and without USN. Results: USN patients showed significantly more omissions than patients without USN and increased omissions with letter spacing. Substitutions were more frequent in USN patients but did not increase with spacing. Performance of patients mainly characterized by substitutions revealed a reduction of errors with spaced pseudowords and a double dissociation from USN. Lesion overlap analysis suggested that the two deficits could depend on different components of visuospatial attention networks. Conclusions: We claim that proper neglect dyslexia is characterized by omission errors and has USN as a necessary mechanism, even if not sufficient. Conversely, acquired crowding dyslexia is a different reading deficit, characterized by substitutions due to an enhanced crowding phenomenon, independent of USN.

    "content": "Objective: Cannabis has become increasingly accessible to populations living with chronic health conditions such as HIV. Many people living with HIV are turning to cannabis for symptom relief despite the unclear risks to neurocognitive health. Our study sought to replicate and extend prior research by examining global and domain-specific neurocognitive performance between four groups stratified by use of cannabis (CB; CB+/CB\u2212) and HIV serostatus (HIV+/HIV\u2212). Method: Our demographically diverse community sample (<em>N</em> = 269) underwent exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the effects of cannabis use (CU) and HIV on neurocognition. We explored between-group comparisons of neurocognitive performance, probability of neurocognitive impairment, and interactive effects of CU/HIV serostatus. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed nonsignificant differences in global or domain-specific neurocognitive performance. However, the CB+/HIV+ group was three times (99% CI [1.18, 9.57]) more likely to be labeled with a memory impairment compared to the control (CB-/HIV\u2212), and the CB+/HIV\u2212 group was twice (99% CI [.14, 7.47]) as likely to be labeled with an executive functioning impairment compared to the control. We also identified an interactive effect between the past 30-day CU and HIV serostatus for global (<em>b</em> = \u2212.026, 99% CI [\u2212.04, \u2212.01]) and motor (<em>b</em> = \u2212.052, 99% CI [\u2212.07, \u2212.03]) neurocognitive performance. Findings support a nuanced relationship between CU and HIV, which may partly explain mixed literature. Conclusions: Although we conclude that recent and heavy CU poses risk of neurocognitive decline among people living with HIVs, this effect is modest. Physicians and patients must weigh a possible decrease in global and motor neurocognition against the severity of symptoms being treated.

The most three frequent animals in dreams were dogs, cats, and snakes, or fishes, or birds. The frequency of waking-life experiences related to elder relatives was correlated with both the frequency of dreaming about elder relatives and the frequency of dreaming about animals. Yet, the latter two variables were not correlated with each other. The results supported the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. In addition, the results may suggest that some animals in dreams represented elder relatives in waking life metaphorically. Moreover, the results may support Carl Jung\u2019s idea that the image of animals in dreams may be a symbol of parents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Sexual dreams reflect individuals\u2019 attitudes toward sex, the personal significance of sex, and/or sexual issues in their waking life. Gaining insight into the factors associated with the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences is beneficial for achieving a comprehensive assessment of sexual mental health. The study will explore the relationship among personality traits, anxiety, depression, and sexual dream experiences based on the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. A questionnaire was administered to 384 participants (mean age = 20.63 years, SD = 1.21; 205 females, 179 males), revealing that over half of them reported having sexual dreams, with a higher prevalence among males. The sexual dream group scored higher than the nonsexual dream group on aggressiveness, neuroticism, and sensation seeking. Furthermore, negative emotions, sensation seeking, activity, and extraversion play an important role in the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences among sexual dreamers. These findings provide valuable insights for sexual education practitioners to understand individuals\u2019 sexual dream experiences and related psychological factors, contributing to scientific advancements in sexual health and education.

    "content": "In separate literature\u2014end-of-life experiences, dreams in bereavement, and continuing bonds in bereavement\u2014there are preliminary findings that both dreaming of the deceased and having an experiential encounter while awake are common experiences. The present, brief report is a post hoc analysis of previously unanalyzed items from two studies of bereaved individuals. One study focused on loss following the death of a romantic partner (n = 268) and the other following the death of a dog or cat (n = 199). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had dreamed of the deceased or had a waking experience of seeing, hearing, or feeling the touch of the deceased in the prior month. Consistent with prior research, a substantial portion of each sample (50.7% of the partner loss participants and 32.2% of the pet loss) reported at least one waking experience of seeing, hearing, and/or feeling the deceased. When dreaming of the deceased and/or having a waking experience of the deceased were combined, it was found to be 82.5% for partner loss and 68.2% for pet loss. Furthermore, dreaming about the deceased was related to having such waking experiences. These preliminary, exploratory findings contribute to the growing recognition that we need more research and theory into the function of such experiences for the bereaved and for those facing end of life.

By adopting a culturally responsive stance, CRD guides dream discussions without imposing psychological beliefs, acknowledging that many clients view dreams as meaningful cultural, religious, and spiritual experiences. Within CRD is a framework of key areas of focus: sharing, appreciating, finding the significance, and editing. Recognition of these four areas allows therapists to adaptively facilitate dream discussions using their core helping skills and multicultural competence, enabling dreamwork congruent with clients\u2019 beliefs and therapists\u2019 clinical approaches. The article details the need for CRD and its use in therapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

I'd like a modern UI\u2014dark mode, smooth animations, rounded edges, the works.</p> <p>Priorities: Cross Platform(MacOS and Windows), high stability/perf (esp. canvas), and minimal new learning juggling other projects.</p> <p>I know Python and C# basics, but MVVM/XAML trips me up hard (can grind through it, but ugh). Want to stick to *one* language I can reuse for scripting/automation. No commercial license fees\u2014proprietary means closed-source binaries I can sell without drama.</p> <p>Quick Project Fit</p> <p>- Core Needs: Interactive 2D canvas for diagramming (drag-drop hierarchies, snapping/zooming), invoice gen (e.g., ReportLab in Python or PdfSharp in C#), SQLite for component catalogs.</p> <p>- Modern UI Goal: aim for Fluent/Material-inspired polish.</p> <p>- Deployment: Standalone .app/.exe bundles, no web bloat.</p> <p>Current Tilt: PySide</p> <p>It checks every box\u2014canvas strength, macOS native, Python scripting, easy modernity, and LGPL for sales\u2014without the MVVM wall.

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "title": "Origins of Face Responses in the Human Cortex: fNIRS and fMRI Evidence From Infants",
    "content": "In adults, cortical regions in the fusiform face area (FFA), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) respond selectively to faces, but underlie distinct perceptual and social processes. When do each of these regions, and their distinctive functions, develop? We review recent studies of awake human infants' cortical responses to faces using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results converge, and argue...",

    "content": "This study examined the neural characteristics of belief-bias reasoning in order to reveal the neurocognitive basis of critical thinking. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was utilized to capture the real-time brain hemodynamic activity of 74 college students while they performed a belief-bias syllogistic reasoning task. Values of oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) in regions of interest were analyzed in relation to critical thinking skills assessed by established tests....",

    "title": "Application of Minimum Exercise Model to the Hypoxic Environment",
    "content": "While moderate exercise has been demonstrated to enhance executive function, this beneficial effect may vary depending on the exercise environment. For instance, the decline in blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) associated with ascent to high altitude has been shown not only to induce acute mountain sickness but also to potentially cause decreased cognitive performance. Therefore, exercise under hypoxic conditions may reduce oxygen delivery to various tissues, thereby attenuating the executive...",

There is a great deal of evidence showing that exercise is one of the most promising lifestyle factors that can both improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia by causing molecular, cellular, structural, and functional changes. In this chapter, based on observational studies and intervention studies, we will briefly outline the effects of physical activity and exercise on...",
