    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks).

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location.

In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "content": "Objective. Statistical models are powerful tools for describing biological phenomena such as neuronal spiking activity. Although these models have been widely used to study spontaneous and stimulated neuronal activity, they have not yet been applied to analyze responses to electrical cortical stimulation. In this study, we present an innovative approach to characterize neuronal responses to electrical stimulation in the mouse cortex, providing detailed insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics. Approach. Our method applies mixture models to analyze the Peri-Stimulus time histogram of each neuron, predicting the probability of spiking at specific latencies following the onset of electrical stimuli. By applying this approach, we investigated neuronal responses to cortical stimulation recorded from the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and sensorimotor-related thalamic nuclei in the mouse brain. Main results. The characterization approach achieved high goodness of fit, and the model features were leveraged by applying machine learning methods for stimulus intensity decoding and classification of brain regions to which a neuron belongs given its response to the stimulus. The random forest model demonstrated the highest F1 scores, achieving 92.86% for stimulus intensity decoding and 84.35% for brain zone classification. Significance. This study presents a novel statistical framework for characterizing neuronal responses to electrical cortical stimulation, providing quantitative insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics.

The current preregistered study (<em>N</em> = 104) used a 3-week longitudinal design to investigate the relationships between the frequency of recalled NBMs, memory distrust, rumination over autobiographical events, and self-esteem. Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: Developmental dyslexia (DD) has been related to deficits in multiple cognitive skills. Phonological processing deficits are the most frequently reported in opaque orthographies, but there are few studies of transparent orthographies, such as Spanish. The aim of this study was to comprehensively explore possible deficiencies in cognitive functions in Spanish-speaking Mexican children with DD, to determine whether these deficits can explain problems with decoding fluency and accuracy, and analyze whether they provide support for some of the explanatory hypotheses of DD. Method: An extensive cognitive assessment was performed with Spanish-speaking readers: 40 children (20 girls) with DD (mean age 9.02 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.49) and 40 children (20 girls) who were typical readers (mean age 9.22 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.45). Results: Our results showed that most of the children with DD presented deficits in multiple cognitive skills, although not all of these skills contributed to reading performance. These cognitive deficits were not equally distributed among all children and there was no cognitive skill in which all participants with DD showed poor performance. Our results demonstrated that recognition of letter orientation, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming were significant predictors of reading ability. Conclusion: These findings support the idea that reading is a multifactorial process involving many cognitive skills, and its disruption could arise from different causes. The main findings are discussed in relation to the major explanatory hypotheses of DD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic condition with implications on cognitive functions such as decision-making and impulse control. Intertemporal choice paradigms, measuring temporal discounting, offer insight into decision-making of addictive behaviors. When coupled with mouse kinematics, they also provide implicit measures of decision dynamics. Here, we employed mouse kinematics to investigate the profile of both explicit and implicit intertemporal decision-making in CUD patients versus healthy controls, and the degree of association with clinical, psychiatric, and neuropsychological measures. Method: We recorded mouse kinematics during an intertemporal choice task in 36 CUD patients and 34 healthy matched controls. Before testing, CUD patients underwent a general assessment on a set of addiction-related psychiatric and cognitive domains. Results: In line with previous literature, results revealed higher discount rates in the CUD group. Mouse kinematics was able to discriminate among groups, with CUD patients displaying straighter trajectories for immediate choices and edge-curved ones for future ones. Further, a series of significant correlations have been found between discount rates, kinematic measures and both clinical and psychiatric indices. Conclusions: Overall, these results hold important implications and relevant insights for tailored therapeutic interventions, relapses prediction, and neurobiological classification of addictive disorders.

    "title": "Anhedonia is associated with impaired memory for positive emotional stimuli in individuals with schizophrenia.",
    "content": "Objective: Individuals with psychotic disorders routinely display anhedonia when rated on clinical interviews that rely on retrospective reports of pleasure; however, hedonic response is intact on laboratory paradigms measuring self-reported in-the-moment (i.e., consummatory) pleasure. It is currently unclear how to reconcile this apparent discrepancy. In the present study, we examined the possibility that clinician-rated anhedonia is associated with impaired memory for positive information across two experiments. Method: In Experiment 1, individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ; <em>n</em> = 28) and healthy controls (CN: <em>n</em> = 21) completed valence and arousal ratings of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral photograph stimuli, followed by an unprompted recognition test after a 1-week delay. In Experiment 2, individuals with SZ (<em>n</em> = 102) and CN (<em>n</em> = 60) completed the Emotional Verbal Learning Test, which assesses memory for word stimuli from happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety conditions over five immediate free-recall trials, short-delay free recall, 20-min long-delay free recall, and long-delay yes/no recognition conditions. Results: Results of Experiment 1 indicated that SZ and CN reported similar levels of valence and arousal to visual stimuli; however, SZ had poorer recognition memory for both pleasant and unpleasant stimuli compared with CN. In Experiment 2, CN demonstrated preferential recall for happiness over sadness, anger, and anxiety stimuli. However, this preferential recall advantage for happiness stimuli was less evident in SZ. Conclusions: Across both studies, reduced recall or recognition for positive stimuli was associated with greater severity of anhedonia. Collectively, findings from these two experiments suggest that clinical ratings of anhedonia are associated with memory deficits for positive stimuli in SZ.

    "content": "Body ownership relies on the integration of multisensory signals coming from the environment and the body itself. Considering the substantial neurophysiological and sensory modifications occurring across the lifespan, this study aims to quantitatively evaluate age-related changes in hand ownership and its underlying bottom-up sensory and top-down components from adolescence to advanced aging. Ninety-two healthy women aged 15\u201383 underwent a virtual-reality based visuo-proprioceptive disparity task in which they performed reiterative reaching movements towards visual targets while observing a virtual-hand that could be spatially congruent or displaced at different disparities from the real hand\u2019s position. Ownership was assessed by collecting reaching errors (implicit) and asking ownership judgments toward the virtual-hand (explicit). Errors were modeled using a Bayesian Causal Inference framework in which ownership for the virtual-hand resulted from a weighted average between pure visual and pure proprioceptive guidance according to their relative precision (i.e., bottom-up sensory components), and to the a priori probability that the virtual-hand was one\u2019s own (i.e., top-down prior). Results showed that both explicit and implicit ownership towards spatially incongruent virtual-hands was higher with advancing age. Moreover, the sensory components extracted from the model revealed higher proprioceptive and lower visual variability in older adults, suggesting that as proprioception declines, visual input increasingly assumes a dominant role. No age-effect was found on the prior (i.e., top-down component). We concluded that ownership progressively changes from adolescence to old age, mostly driven by a physiological reduction in proprioceptive abilities. The sensory recalibration toward visual reliance might reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain coherent body ownership despite age-related sensory decline.",

    "title": "Variable admittance control with sEMG-based support for wearable wrist exoskeleton",
    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "title": "Network topological reorganization mechanisms of primary visual cortex under multimodal stimulation",
    "content": "IntroductionThe functional connectivity topology of the primary visual cortex (V1) shapes sensory processing and cross-modal integration, yet how different sensory modalities reorganize V1 network architecture remains unclear. We hypothesized that multimodal input drives a shift from hub-centric, modular processing toward globally integrated, distributed configurations.MethodsWe performed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice to record population activity in V1 during unimodal visual (V) and bimodal visuotactile (V+T) stimulation. From fluorescence time series, we constructed functional connectivity networks and quantified graph-theoretical metrics, including betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, degree centrality, global efficiency, and modularity. Networks were computed per animal and compared across conditions using appropriate non-parametric statistics.ResultsUnimodal visual stimulation increased betweenness centrality and highlighted prominent hub nodes, supporting locally modular, hub-centric information control. In contrast, bimodal visuotactile stimulation elevated closeness centrality and global efficiency, broadened connectivity, and reduced modularity, indicating enhanced global integration with more distributed information flow. Moreover, under unimodal conditions the top five centrality nodes exhibited significantly stronger calcium responses than other neurons, whereas this response hierarchy was abolished under bimodal stimulation.DiscussionV1 dynamically balances local specialization and global integration through context-dependent topological reconfiguration: unimodal processing relies on hub-centric, modular architectures, while cross-modal input promotes globally optimized, distributed networks with higher connectivity efficiency. These findings provide a network-level framework for multisensory integration and offer insights relevant to theories of sensory computation and potential strategies to harness cross-modal plasticity.",

    "title": "On carrier frequency in transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation: a narrative review",
    "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) using kilohertz frequency carrier modulation has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach to improve motor recovery and reduce pain. Early application of 5\u201310 kHz modulated pulses for tSCS has shown promising results in spinal cord (SC) injury and post-stroke rehabilitation, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. Approach. This narrative review synthesizes electrophysiological, computational and clinical evidence to assess how kilohertz modulation influences spinal and corticospinal excitability and analgesia. A total of 20 preclinical and clinical studies comparing the effects of kHz-modulated and conventional stimulation pulses were reviewed. Main results. The results indicate that kilohertz modulated tSCS increases tolerance to stimulation, but requires a higher charge to evoke motor responses in healthy participants and individuals with post-stroke motor disorder. Compared to conventional stimulation, modulated stimulation recruits afferents less efficiently at motor threshold intensity but appears to engage broader corticospinal circuits, especially near or below threshold. Frequency-specific effects include prolonged spinal inhibition, frequency-dependent modulation of supraspinal input, and selective activation of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. Computational study supports these observations, showing that kilohertz pulses produce delayed action potential initiation due to alternating depolarization cycles. A comparative functional study has shown that modulated tSCS improves motor function in individuals with SC injury more significantly than conventional stimulation. Significance. This narrative review highlights gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of modulated tSCS, suggests directions for further research and will be useful in planning studies on the mechanisms behind tSCS with and without carrier frequency. It also holds engineering relevance for the optimal design of stimulation devices.",

    "title": "Helical neural implants for intracerebral drug delivery",
    "content": "Objective. Neurological disorders often arise from specific regions of dysfunction in the brain. One approach to target these pathologic regions is through chemical delivery using intracerebral implants. Previous works have designed implants that are small and flexible, minimizing the mechanical mismatch between inorganic implants and soft organic brain tissue. Most of these implants are simple cylindrical catheters with inflow and outflow ports at either end of the cylinder. This limits the region and volume of tissue that can be dosed. We sought to develop novel catheter designs that permit targeting of larger volumes of brain tissue while maintaining minimal footprint to minimize gliosis. Approach. We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel helical-shaped microfluidic catheter we term SPIRAL (Strategic Precision Infusion for Regional Administration of Liquid). SPIRAL leverages rational fluidic design of multiple fluid outflow ports to vary infused fluid spatial distribution across brain regions. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models to test the fluid dynamic functionality and chronic viability of SPIRAL. Results. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) models illustrate how SPIRAL can be configured to permit simultaneous dosing through multiple outflow ports yielding a variable fluid distribution compared to a straight catheter. We show how CFD in silico models can be used to optimize dimensions of channel openings across SPIRAL, to achieve uniform flow through channels and validate these results in vitro. We show how chronically implanted SPIRAL catheters do not increase gliosis compared to standard straight catheters of similar dimensions or materials. Significance. Our helical intracerebral drug delivery catheter facilitates fluid localization while maintaining minimal invasiveness. SPIRAL could enable multiregional brain access and improve therapeutic efforts in the treatment of neurological diseases.",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Neuroaesthetics, an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and the arts, offers new perspectives on the biological and cognitive mechanisms of aesthetic experience. This narrative review explores the convergence of neuroaesthetics and neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington\u2019s disease. Drawing on evidence from neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and clinical studies, we examine how neurodegenerative processes differentially disrupt the neural systems of the \u201caesthetic triad\u201d: sensory-motor, emotion-valuation, and meaning-knowledge. Such disruptions not only impair patients\u2019 ability to perceive and create art but may also reveal unexpected creative capacities. We discuss the therapeutic potential of arts-based interventions, highlighting the benefits of personalized and technology-driven approaches, including immersive virtual reality and digital art platforms, to enhance neurorehabilitation and psychological wellbeing. The \u201cMichelangelo effect,\u201d where engagement in meaningful aesthetic activities supports learning, motivation, and resilience, exemplifies this translational potential. Our synthesis underscores clinical, neuroscientific, and rehabilitative implications, while noting ongoing challenges such as the need for standardized outcomes and interdisciplinary collaboration. Integrating neuroaesthetic principles into neurorehabilitation may help preserve cognitive and motor functions and enrich quality of life and self-concept in people with neurodegenerative disease. Future research should optimize these approaches to ensure meaningful benefits for patients.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

    "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
    "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

    "content": "Objective: Earlier research on fatigue in post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) has mainly studied subjective fatigue, either over a prolonged period (trait fatigue) or in relation to a certain situation (state fatigue) in the form of perceived fatigability. Another aspect of state fatigue, cognitive performance fatigability, defined as a decline in performance over time in cognitively demanding tasks, has not been the focus of PCC research. We aimed to examine performance fatigability and the associations between these three fatigue domains. Method: Thirty-four individuals with PCC and 36 controls who recovered from COVID-19 without PCC performed cognitive tests repeated twice during the test session to assess performance fatigability. Self-reports were used to assess perceived fatigability (repeated Visual Analogue Scales) and trait fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory). Results: Analysis of covariance showed significant interactions in two tests measuring processing speed: coding (<em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = .17) and a speed composite score derived from Color\u2013Word Interference Test (<em>p</em> = .031, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = .08), where the controls improved their performance more on the repeated tests compared with the PCC group, indicating performance fatigability in the PCC group. For the PCC group, no correlations were found between fatigue domains (<em>r</em> < 0.34). Conclusions: The PCC group exhibited performance fatigability in measures of processing speed. There were no correlations between fatigue domains, suggesting that the domains might represent separate constructs. The results highlight the need to differentiate between various types of fatigue in research and clinical practice and to assess performance fatigability in addition to using self-reports to obtain a comprehensive understanding of fatigue and fatigability.

    "content": "Objective: Initial findings indicate that semantic memory retrieval of different categories, such as fruits and animals, is variably impacted in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Importantly, theories of embodied cognition propose that these variances may stem from compromised motor processing in PD patients. Indeed, the conceptual representation of the fruits category may involve aspects of manipulability and graspability, which are less relevant for the animals category. We aimed to assess semantic memory retrieval of fruits versus animals category as assessed by semantic fluency (SF) in PD by using the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Marker Initiative database. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 104 healthy controls (HC), 264 patients with sporadic de novo PD (S-PD), and 57 patients with genetic PD (G-PD). Additionally, we carried out explorative analysis concerning possible differences between S-PD and G-PF on SF. Results: We found lower fruits SF performance in PD (S-PD plus G-PD) compared to HC; however, this score could not classify the two groups. Crucially, no difference for the animals class was found. When analyzing separately S-PD and G-PD, we found that fruits SF in S-PD was lower compared to HC and was negatively associated with S-PD diagnosis. Remarkably, no difference for the animals class was found. We did not find significant SF differences in the G-PD. Moreover, SF scores, regardless of the category, were uncorrelated with dopamine integrity measures and motor symptoms scales. Conclusions: The findings reveal distinct patterns of category dissociation in S-PD and G-PD, suggesting a potential link between category dissociation and motor embodiment processes in PD.

    "title": "Using the Modified Taylor Complex Figure\u2013Recognition Trial (MTCF-RT) to differentiate amnestic patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease from patients with memory deficits due to Parkinson\u2019s disease or subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.",
    "content": "Objective: The Modified Taylor Complex Figure\u2013Recognition Trial (MTCF-RT) is a visual recognition memory measure that consists of a recognition trial to be administered after the copy and the delayed reproduction of the Modified Taylor Complex Figure Test. The aim of this study was to validate the MTCF-RT in differentiating amnestic patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) from patients with memory deficits due to Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) or subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD). Method: The MTCF-RT was administered to 25 amnestic patients with AD and 25 patients with memory deficits due to SIVD (<em>n</em> = 18) or PD (<em>n</em> = 7). Additionally, the recognition trial was administered to 40 neurologically unimpaired individuals. All patients were tested on a brief neuropsychological battery, and their magnetic resonance scans were assessed for medial temporal lobe atrophy. Results: MTCF-RT performance was significantly lower in the group of amnestic patients with AD than in the group of amnestic patients with non-AD disorders, whereas healthy subjects performed significantly better than the two experimental groups. The MTCF-RT allowed identifying amnestic patients with AD with 92% sensitivity and 96% specificity using a cutoff of \u22647.358, showing a higher discriminant power with respect to other long-term memory measures. Finally, MTCF-RT scores showed a high negative correlation with medial temporal lobe atrophy and a positive correlation with other long-term memory measures. Conclusions: MTCF-RT could be a useful tool, as part of a larger neuropsychological battery, for discriminating patients with AD from those with memory deficits due to PD or SIVD.

    "content": "Objective: The treatment of dementia is increasingly likely to focus on dementia-related biomarkers. Unfortunately, there is variability with regard to biomarker-related effects. This analysis tests an algorithm capable of identifying persons adversely impacted by any dementia-related biomarker in this case, amyloidopathy as estimated by positron emission tomography (PET). Method: <em>N</em> = 1,737 subjects of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative were assigned to amyloidopathy-affliction classes. Moderation effects were tested by chi-square difference. Results: 39.3% of subjects with (+) PET results were assigned to the afflicted class. The afflicted subjects had greater dementia severity and higher amyloid burdens. These effects persisted at 36 months. Furthermore, the association between amyloid burden and dementia severity was moderated by affliction class. Afflicted nondemented cases with positive PET findings were more likely to convert to clinical \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d over 48 months, by Cox\u2019s<em> F: F</em>(312, 154) = 1.27, <em>p</em> = .05. PET assessed amyloid burden was not related to dementia severity in resilient PET (+) cases. Conclusion: Our approach could allow for more accurate prediction of biomarker effects and guide precision interventions against specific biomarkers.

    "title": "Semantic processing in subjective cognitive decline: An eye-tracking study.",
    "content": "Objectives: Alzheimer\u2019s disease progresses through several stages, starting with a preclinical phase characterized by subjective cognitive decline (SCD), where individuals express concerns about their memory despite normal cognitive test results. Recent research has indicated subtle semantic difficulties in SCD, prompting the need for a deeper investigation into cognitive processing during this phase. This study aimed to investigate the cognitive processing of famous and unfamiliar faces in individuals with SCD compared to healthy controls, focusing on semantic memory deficits assessment. Method: Twenty-seven participants with SCD and 26 control participants performed a judgment task involving famous and unfamiliar faces while their eye movements were recorded. Mean fixation times, number of revisitations, and number of fixations were analyzed between the two groups. Results: The SCD group exhibited no significant differences in mean fixation times and in the number of revisited regions between famous and unfamiliar faces, in contrast to the control group, which showed distinct patterns in processing these categories of stimuli. Conclusion: These findings suggest that individuals with SCD process famous faces similarly to unfamiliar faces, indicating a potential weakening of semantic processing in SCD. This may have implications for early detection of cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "content": "Flavor, a multimodal perception based on taste, smell, and tactile cues, plays a significant role in consumer preferences and purchase intentions toward coffee. In this exploratory study, we assessed the potential of electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict coffee sensory attributes. We extracted spectral and temporal features from a professional panel while tasting coffee samples and basic water solutions. We trained multiple Least-Squares Boosted Trees (LSBoost) and optimized their hyperparameters through a 100-step Bayesian approach based on a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) scheme. The models achieved, overall, high predictive accuracy (MAE < 0.75 on a 0 \u2212 10 scale) and medium-to-large robustness (Cohen'sd>0.6) with respect to mean and lasso benchmark regressors. Feature importance analysis revealed that spectral powers and Hjorth's parameters within parietal, central, and frontal regions were the most predictive. Our findings endorse the use of EEG-based ML models as an alternative to traditional flavor evaluation methods, such as Descriptive Sensory Analysis (DSA).",

    "title": "Remarkable therapeutic effects of methylphenidate in periodic limb movement disorder comorbid with excessive daytime sleepiness: a case report",
    "content": "BackgroundPeriodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is a sleep-related movement disorder, which may be accompanied by a complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). With this study, we reported a clinical therapy process up to 2.5\u202fyears follow-up, exploring the therapeutic effect of a series of medicines in PLMD comorbid EDS.Case presentationA 27-year-old woman suffered from EDS for more than 10\u202fyears and was then diagnosed with PLMD. Initially, we used levodopa 250\u202fmg per night for 12\u202fweeks, then piribedil 50\u202fmg per night was arranged as the second drug for 12\u202fweeks, and the third drug, pramipexole, was prescribed at a dosage of 0.25\u202fmg per night for 12\u202fweeks, but the EDS was persistent despite the periodic leg movement index (PLMI) returning to normal. Finally, methylphenidate was prescribed at a dosage of 18\u202fmg per day after 4\u202fweeks of washout. Then, the indicators of EDS and PLMD all returned to normal after 6\u202fweeks. A 2.5-year follow-up was scheduled for taking methylphenidate; the symptoms of EDS were steadily well controlled, and PLMI was still kept in the normal range.ConclusionThis finding suggests that methylphenidate is an optimal therapeutic approach for the management of PLMD comorbid EDS.",

    "title": "Neural mechanism of HT7 electroacupuncture in myocardial ischemia: critical role of the paraventricular nucleus oxytocin system",
    "content": "ObjectiveElectroacupuncture (EA) at Shenmen (HT7) alleviates acute myocardial ischemia (AMI), but its central neuromodulatory mechanisms remain insufficiently defined. This study investigated whether oxytocinergic (OT) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) mediate the cardioprotective effects of EA and verified causality through chemogenetic interventions.MethodsPart I: C57BL/6 mice (n\u202f=\u202f18) were allocated into three groups: sham, AMI, and AMI\u202f+\u202fEA-HT7 (2\u202fHz/1\u202fmA, 30\u202fmin/day\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fdays). Cardiac function (echocardiography), histopathology (HE/Masson staining), and PVN electrophysiology were evaluated. Part II: C57BL/6 mice (n\u202f=\u202f18) were divided into sham, AMI, and AMI\u202f+\u202fEA-HT7 groups. Mice received AAV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry and AAV-cre-OT injections into the PVN. EA-induced neuronal activation was quantified by c-Fos and OT co-localization. Part III: C57BL/6 mice (n\u202f=\u202f18) were assigned to chemogenetic activation (OT-activation), inhibition (OT-inhibition), and control (OT-control) groups. Under physiological conditions, the effects of chemogenetic modulation on PVN electrophysiology, electrocardiography, and echocardiography were assessed. Part IV: C57BL/6 mice (n\u202f=\u202f24) were divided into AMI\u202f+\u202fOT-control, AMI\u202f+\u202fEA-HT7\u202f+\u202fOT-control, AMI\u202f+\u202fOT-inhibition, and AMI\u202f+\u202fEA-HT7\u202f+\u202fOT-activation groups. Under pathological conditions, the effects of chemogenetic regulation on PVN physiology and cardiac function were examined.ResultsEA at HT7 improved left ventricular ejection fraction (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), correlating with suppression of PVN neuronal firing. EA specifically inhibited PVNOT neuronal activity (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Under physiological conditions, chemogenetic modulation of PVNOT neurons altered local electrophysiological activity and cardiac performance. In AMI mice, OT neuronal activation reversed EA-induced cardioprotection (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionPVN oxytocinergic neurons are both necessary and sufficient for the cardioprotective effects of EA at HT7. Chemogenetic regulation confirms a causal neurocardiac axis, providing mechanistic insights that support precision acupuncture therapies for ischemic heart disease.",

    "content": "The circadian system regulates core physiological processes, including muscle regeneration, protein synthesis, and cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in circadian rhythms contribute to impaired muscle function in older adults, with age-related declines in muscle mass and regenerative capacity serving as major contributors to sarcopenia. Emerging evidence indicates that exercise\u2014a powerful modulator of muscle adaptation\u2014can also influence circadian regulation, offering a potential avenue to enhance muscle repair in aging populations. This review examines how physical activity interacts with circadian mechanisms in aged skeletal muscle, emphasizing key molecular and cellular pathways involved in muscle regeneration. Central circadian regulators such as Clock, BMAL1, and PER1 are discussed in the context of muscle protein turnover, satellite cell activity, and mitochondrial function. Aligning exercise timing with circadian rhythms is proposed as a promising strategy to enhance muscle recovery and functional capacity in older individuals. Furthermore, the review highlights the therapeutic potential of chrono-exercise to delay the onset of sarcopenia and promote healthy aging. By integrating insights from chronobiology, geroscience, and exercise physiology, this analysis underscores the importance of chrono-exercise in supporting muscle health during aging.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo summarize the clinical characteristics of eight children with DEPDC5 gene variant-associated epilepsy.MethodsClinical data of children with DEPDC5-related epilepsy treated at Hebei Provincial Children\u2019s Hospital from April 2020 to November 2024 were retrospectively analyzed.ResultsAmong the 8 children (5 males, 3 females), age of onset ranged from 1\u202fyear 4\u202fmonths to 9\u202fyears 3\u202fmonths. Genetic analysis revealed 6 missense mutations, 1 code-shift mutation, and 1 large segment deletion, including 1 de novo and 7 hereditary mutations. Four children exhibited global developmental delay. Seizure types included generalized tonic\u2013clonic (5 cases), tonic (1 case), and 2 forms of seizures: tonic seizures and atonic seizures (2 cases). EEG showed abnormal discharges in all cases: focal (4 cases), multifocal (3 cases), and slow-wave (1 case). Brain MRI abnormalities were observed in 4 children, including delayed myelination, hyaloid septal cavities, and microgyrus malformation. Diagnoses included Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome (4 cases) and self-limiting epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (2 cases). Six children responded well to medication (seizure reduction >25%), while 2 had poor control.ConclusionDEPDC5 gene mutations result in diverse phenotypes, potentially influenced by age of onset and mutation type. Generalized seizures were most common, with high rates of EEG abnormalities and structural brain changes. In a few cases (3 cases), treatment with levetiracetam and phenobarbital can reduce the frequency of epileptic seizures by 25%, but due to limited sample size, its exact efficacy still needs further research and verification.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
    "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "title": "An Active Insole to Reduce Plantar Pressure Loading: Using Predictive Finite Element Driven Soft Hydraulic Actuators to Minimize Plantar Pressure and the Pressure Time Integral for Diabetic Foot Ulceration Risk Management",
    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "title": "Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs",
    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Inhibitory GABAergic neuron loss due to oxidative damage during ex vivo acute brain slice preparation influences genesis and dynamics of epileptiform activity",
    "content": "Ex vivo acute brain slice is a popular technique in neuroscience research. Since its inception five decades ago, many variations of the brain slice preparation method have emerged. While all variations are currently used by many labs throughout the world, no study has comprehensively examined the impact of these variation on the quality of the acute brain slice preparation. In this study, we comprehensively examined the effect of animal sacrifice methods (decapitation or transcardial perfusion) and cutting solution (normal or sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid) on brain slice preparation. Neuronal population was quantified by immunohistochemistry against various neuronal markers. Neuronal dynamics was evaluated by in vitro electrophysiology using two acute epilepsy models-zero-magnesium and 4-aminopyridine. To modulate the stress incurred in acute brain slice preparation, we administered antioxidants or HIF-1 inhibitor, chrysin, to the cutting solution. The method of brain slice preparation significantly affected the quality of the brain slice preparation. In general, the combination of transcardial perfusion and sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid produces the optimal brain slice preparation. This is evidenced by a preservation of inhibitory GABAergic neurons in slices prepared with this combination. We subsequently found that this loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons significantly influenced the genesis and dynamics of induced acute epileptiform activity. The slices with preserved inhibition had less successful induction of acute epileptiform activity and a seizure-like event that is typical of those induced in brain with preserved inhibition. Finally, we found that loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons during brain slice preparation is primarily due to oxidative damage. Limiting oxidative stress is an effective neuroprotection strategy to prevent loss of inhibition in brain slice preparation. In conclusion, consideration of brain slice preparation method is crucial in preserving inhibitory GABAergic neurons and the degree of inhibition in ex vivo acute brain slice preparation.",

    "title": "WSB.APP/PS1 mice develop age-dependent cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebrovascular deficits, and white matter damage, which are modified by humanized APOE alleles.",
    "content": "Vascular contributions are now widely accepted to play a key role in many cases of dementia, including Alzheimers disease (AD), that commonly manifest as cerebral small vessel diseases, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). However, the mechanisms by which vascular contributions such as CAA contribute dementias such as AD are not well understood. This is due in part to the lack mouse models that develop robust CAA, hampering our ability to develop therapies that target vascular deficits. To address this, we have explored the use of distinct genetic contexts to enhance the face validity of mouse models for AD. We have previously identified the WSB/EiJ (WSB) strain as a model that shows increased susceptibility to CAA in the presence of the APP/PS1 amyloid driver, compared to the commonly used C57BL/6J (B6) strain. Here, we now perform an in-depth characterization of WSB.APP/PS1 and its WSB wild type (WT) counterpart, assessing male and female mice, at 4, 8, and 12 months of age (M). We show that WSB.APP/PS1 mice show mild CAA at 8M, with robust CAA being apparent at 14M. Transcriptional profiling showed strong correlation to AMP-AD gene expression modules highlighting the human relevance of WSB.APP/PS1 mice and predicted white matter deficits at 14M that was confirmed by immunofluorescence. PET/CT showed blood flow and metabolic deficits, and modifications in small vessel morphology in 8M WSB.APP/PS1 compared to WSB WT mice. We tested whether cerebrovascular reactivity deficits in WSB WT mice may underly the susceptibility to CAA, but interestingly, they did not show age-dependent decline in reactivity that was observed in B6 mice. Finally, using an allelic series of humanized apolipoprotein E (APOE), we show that APOE4 increased the extent of CAA in WSB.APP/PS1 mice, compared to APOE2 and APOE3, but in a sex-dependent manner. Collectively, these data show the utility of the WSB strain to uncover mechanisms of vascular contributions to Alzheimers disease and related dementias.",

This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

    "content": "The aim of this study was to assess whether participants who present more frequently with nightmares or distressing dreams have had traumatic experiences in their childhood and their relationship with current personality traits. Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

These patterns suggest that unemployment is associated with distinct alterations in dream content, reflecting reduced cognitive engagement and heightened preoccupation with occupational concerns.

This article examines this possibility by providing an overview of the theoretical rationale for their relationship and a preliminary empirical study exploring the relationships between a brief measure of fragmentation proneness, distress, and nightmares among 307 undergraduate students. The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares.

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample.

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

    "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

MRI modalities included T2-weighted imaging, T1 and T2 relaxation mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, and diffusion kurtosis imaging. Radiomics features were extracted, correlated with behavioral metrics, and analyzed using clustering and radiomics scoring. Logistic regression models incorporating single-modality and multimodal radiomics features were developed and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Subgroup analyses assessed predictive performance and correlations with behavioral and developmental indices.ResultsASD model rats exhibited growth retardation, anxiety-like behavior, and deficits in social interaction and memory, which were alleviated by selenium supplementation. The multimodal radiomics model outperformed single-modality models, achieving the highest area under the ROC curve and strong predictive capability in subgroup analyses. Significant correlations were identified between multimodal radiomics scores and behavioral as well as developmental measures.DiscussionThe cerebellum was a key region affected in ASD, whereas the visual\u2013auditory cortex showed notable responses to selenium treatment. In conclusion, the multimodal radiomics model demonstrates high diagnostic efficacy, highlights the cerebellum as a key region affected in ASD, and suggests the visual\u2013auditory cortex as a primary target of selenium intervention, enhancing predictive accuracy for structural and functional brain improvements post-treatment.",

    "title": "EEG synchronization signatures for decoding attentional states during continuous force control",
    "content": "IntroductionMind wandering, the shift of attention from an ongoing task to task-unrelated thoughts, is a pervasive cognitive phenomenon often accompanied by detrimental consequences for task performance. While extensively studied in visual and auditory paradigms, attentional fluctuations during visuo-haptic tasks, such as force control, remain underexplored despite their high relevance to real-world skilled activities such as surgical operations or robotic-assisted manipulation. There exists a critical deficiency in exploring signatures of mind wandering from the perspective of neural synchronization.MethodsThis study investigated EEG-based synchronization features to decode attentional states during a novel continuous force control task using the thought-probe method. Nine healthy male participants tracked a dynamically varying target force while scalp EEG and high-frequency force data were recorded synchronously. EEG epochs preceding self-reported attentional probes were labeled as on-task or mind-wandering states. Spectral power and three synchronization features \u2013 cross-frequency coupling, functional connectivity, and neural-behavioral synchronization \u2013 were extracted and compared between on-task and mind-wandering states.Results and discussionResults revealed that the mind-wandering state was characterized by increased alpha power (8-10 Hz) over frontal-posterior regions and reduced occurrence of high alpha-theta harmonic ratios. It also exhibited increased functional connectivity within sensorimotor networks and decreased mutual information between frontal EEG activity and force errors. Support vector machine classifiers for the binary attentional-state classification, utilizing combined spectral power and synchronization features, achieved 75.53% within-participant and 71.57% cross-participant accuracy, outperforming single-feature models. These findings highlight EEG synchronization signatures of mind wandering and demonstrate their feasibility for decoding attentional states during the force control task. This work may provide a foundation for future exploration of haptic-based neurofeedback systems, which could potentially complement existing visual and auditory modalities in applications such as neurocognitive rehabilitation or skilled motor training.",

    "content": "Spatial group independent component analysis (sgr-ICA) is widely used in resting-state fMRI to identify intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). While lower-order decompositions reveal large-scale networks, higher-order models provide finer granularity but have been limited by small sample sizes. In this study, we applied sgr-ICA with 500 components to more than 100,000 subjects with rsfMRI to generate a robust fine-grained ICN template. Using this template, we examined whole brain functional network connectivity (FNC) in 502 individuals with schizophrenia and 640 typical controls and compared the findings with a lower order multiscale template. The 500-component template yielded a large set of reliable ICNs, particularly in the cerebellar and paralimbic regions, and revealed schizophrenia-related dysconnectivity patterns that were not detected at larger spatial scales. Specifically, we observed hypoconnectivity between the cerebellar and subcortical domains (basal ganglia and thalamus) and hyperconnectivity between the cerebellar domain and the visual, sensorimotor and higher cognitive domains. These results demonstrate that very high-order ICA can capture distinct fine-grained ICNs, improving the detection of disease-related connectivity differences and enriching current multiscale ICN templates. The derived ICNs can serve as a valuable reference for future studies and potentially enhance the clinical utility of rsfMRI in psychiatric research.",

    "content": "The small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel SK3, encoded by the KCNN3 gene, plays a critical role in regulating dopaminergic neuron (DN) firing patterns by modulating after hyperpolarization currents. SK3 dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed structural and functional consequences of KCNN3 splicing and genetic variation. Alternative splicing variants of the KCNN3 gene were retrieved from the Ensembl database and aligned using T-Coffee, manually inspected and curated. Protein domains were identified with Pfam 35.0, SMART 9.0, and InterPro 98.0, and visualized. An AlphaFold2 model of SK3 full-length protein (UniProt: Q9UGI6) used as reference and structural models of its splicing variants were predicted with ColabFold. Functional domains (S1\u2013S6 transmembrane helices, H5 pore loop, and calmodulin-binding) were defined and superimposed onto the AlphaFold2 reference. Domain integrity was assessed based on completeness of all expected residue indices within each functional region. SNPs and CNVs across all coding KCNN3 splicing variants were analyzed, classified, and filtered to isolate pathogenic variants prioritizing non-synonymous amino acid substitutions. Differential variant impacts across splicing isoforms were assessed by mapping variant positions to individual transcript protein sequences and used to predict functional consequences. Two long and two short splicing variants are known. Short variants lack the motif required for potassium channels. Pathogenic variants result from missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions. In all cases, the consequential effects depend on the specific location and role of the amino acid being changed.",

    "content": "Objective. Steady-state visually evoked potential-based Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or participants of previous experiments), to the new user (target domain) using only unlabeled target data. Approach. Our method adapts the pre-trained DNN to the new user by minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and local-regularity terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and forces the DNN to assign similar labels to adjacent instances. Main results. Our method achieves excellent ITRs of 201.15\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 and 145.02\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 on the benchmark and BETA datasets, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is available at https://github.com/osmanberke/SFDA-SSVEP-BCI. Significance. The proposed method prioritizes user comfort by removing the burden of calibration while maintaining an excellent character identification accuracy and ITR. Because of these attributes, our approach could significantly accelerate the adoption of BCI systems into everyday life.",

However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning...",

    "content": "Neurons that produce NPS send output to brain regions implicated in circadian function and threat responses, but less is known about the afferent control of NPS neurons. In this study, we used a conventional retrograde tracer, cholera toxin beta subunit (CTb), to identify afferents to the rostral-lateral parabrachial region that contains the main concentration of NPS neurons. We then used Cre-dependent rabies retrograde tracing in Nps-2A-Cre mice to identify inputs specifically to NPS neurons. Nps-expressing neurons receive heavy input from auditory brainstem structures, including the inferior colliculus, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, superior olivary complex, and cochlear nucleus. These findings suggest an unexpected role for auditory information in controlling the activity of NPS neurons.",

    "title": "Cell-Intrinsic Vulnerability and Immune Activation Cooperate to Drive Degeneration in a Mitochondrial Complex I Deficiency Model of Optic Neuropathy",
    "content": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central hallmark of many optic neuropathies, yet the mechanisms linking intrinsic metabolic stress to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we developed conditional transgenic models targeting the mitochondrial complex I subunit Ndufs4 in the retina. Broad deletion of Ndufs4 in the retina resulted in vision loss, progressive RGC degeneration, and pronounced immune activation before overt RGC death. Strikingly, depletion of myeloid cells significantly preserved RGCs, demonstrating that inflammation is not simply a downstream consequence but a participant in the degeneration process. To further distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, we generated a mosaic model in which only subsets of retinal cells lacked Ndufs4. In this paradigm, the degeneration first appeared selectively in mutant regions, suggesting that mitochondrial impairment within RGCs is necessary to initiate vulnerability. At later stages, however, the degeneration extended beyond mutant territories, highly suggestive of a propagation through non-cell autonomous processes. Together, these findings support a model in which mitochondrial dysfunction creates the conditions for neuronal vulnerability, while immune responses govern the timing and extent of cell loss. This framework explains the consistent co-occurrence of metabolic deficits and neuroinflammation in optic neuropathies and highlights the importance of their interactions in disease progression. By clarifying the intersection of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, this work advances our understanding of RGC degeneration and provides a conceptual basis for deciphering pathogenic processes across diverse optic neuropathies.",

    "content": "Risk-taking behavior is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction. In this study, we present a data-driven approach to identify neural biomarkers of risk- taking from intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) recordings. Using time and frequency domain features, we train a classifier to distinguish between risk-taking and risk- avoidance behaviors. Based on data from a single patient, the model achieves an accuracy of 68.5%, which is significantly above chance. These results highlight the potential of identifying risk-taking states from invasive recordings. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying risk-related biomarkers from intracranial recordings, highlighting a promising direction for closed-loop neuromodulation for neuropsychiatric conditions.",

    "content": "Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus are critical for sickness and malaise but have also been proposed to control non-aversive (rewarding) satiation. How one cell type can coordinate these opposing processes has not been explained. Here we reinvestigate the function of these cells using single-cell imaging and optical manipulations. Contrary to current models, we show that CGRP neurons do not track cumulative food consumption, and their activity is not necessary for meal termination or satiety. Instead, we identify two distinct populations of CGRP cells, one of which responds rapidly to appetitive signals during ingestion and the other of which responds slowly to aversive visceral cues. Surprisingly, the ingestion-activated CGRP neurons are important for learning about post-ingestive effects but do not control ongoing food consumption. This reveals two populations of CGRP neurons that are sequentially engaged during, and responsible for, the distinct stages of post-ingestive, aversive learning.",

    "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

    "title": "Modeling dyslexia in neurotypical adults by combining neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques: a hypothesis paper",
    "content": "Dyslexia is a prevalent developmental disorder marked by deficits in literacy skills. Given that the core deficits of dyslexia are uniquely human, animal models have not been as useful in dyslexia research as they have been in other areas of research. While significant progress has been made through behavioral and neuroimaging studies, a viable model could facilitate controlled investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia and accelerate the development of targeted interventions. In this hypothesis article, we propose a two-pronged approach to model dyslexia in neurotypical adults using neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques. First, we propose using functional and structural MRI data to cluster individuals into neuropathologically derived subgroups in order to facilitate the classification of dyslexia subtypes based on neuropathological characteristics. Second, we propose employing transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) to temporarily downregulate activity in brain regions specified in the clustering analysis, inducing subtype-specific dyslexic symptoms in neurotypical individuals. This approach enables the establishment of causal or probabilistic relationships between neuropathologies and dyslexia subtypes, while at the same time creating dyslexia models to facilitate investigation into subtype-specific interventions. Although this model is somewhat limited by the transient nature of neuromodulation as well as by the use of healthy adults to model a developmental disorder whose symptoms first arise in childhood, it is a meaningful step towards refining our understanding of the neural basis of dyslexia subtypes and it opens the door to novel and effective therapies. By integrating neuroimaging and neuromodulation, we hope to offer a viable substitute for animal models in dyslexia and accelerate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for dyslexia.",

    "title": "Efficacy of snap-needle patch therapy in pediatric epilepsy: a case study",
    "content": "BackgroundsEpilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder in early childhood, often characterized by genetic predisposition and diverse clinical manifestations. Benign epilepsy of childhood with central temporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common form of self-limited focal epilepsy (SeLFE) syndrome in children, accounting for approximately 6%\u20137% of all childhood epilepsy cases (Wirrell et al., 2011; Camfield et al., 1996). We report a case of a child who was treated with additional snap-needle for 3 months on top of poorly controlled oral medication alone, who stopped having seizures and gradually reduced the dose of oral medication and finally stopped, and was followed up for 1 year after stopping the medication without any recurrence.Case summaryA 10-years-old male had his first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) at age 7 during nocturnal sleep. Following this event, the parents sought medical evaluation, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal wave patterns. Over the following 3 years, the child had 2\u20133 GTCS annually; despite multiple adjustments to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, GTCS frequency indicated disease progression. However, after starting snap-needle patch therapy [guided by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles], the child remained seizure-free. Continuous monitoring has been conducted to date. We present this case of a pediatric patient with epilepsy: oral medication failed to control GTCS, but snap-needle patch therapy achieved successful seizure management, after which oral medication was discontinued.ConclusionAfter a systematic literature search, this study represents the first case report of BECTS treated with snap-needle therapy (needle size: 0.220 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm). In this case, the child\u2019s GTCSs resolved following the addition of snap-needle therapy, and oral antiepileptic medication was gradually reduced to complete discontinuation; no seizure recurrence was observed within 1 year of follow-up. It is important to acknowledge that the contributions of medication adjustments and the self-limiting nature of BECTS cannot be ruled out in this case. However, based on the observations here, we propose the hypothesis that snap-needle intervention is likely associated with seizure remission. Although the mechanism underlying snap-needle therapy for BECTS remains unclear, the child achieved a QOLCE-16-C score of 98.4 at the end of treatment; during the 1-year follow-up, the number of nighttime sleep disruptions also decreased from 2 to 5 episodes per year to 0. These outcomes surpass those typically achievable through pharmacological intervention alone.",

    "title": "The articulatory basis of phonological error patterns in childhood speech sound disorders",
    "content": "Speech acquisition involves complex coordination of articulatory structures, primarily the jaw, lips, and tongue. Typically developing children acquire speech sounds in a hierarchical sequence governed by progressive neuromotor maturation. However, disruptions in speech motor control can lead to systematic phonological error patterns, commonly attributed to cognitive-linguistic deficits. This study explores the articulatory foundations of phonological error patterns in preschool-aged children diagnosed with moderate-to-severe speech sound disorders. Using data from 48 children who participated in a randomized controlled trial, we employed Mutual Information Analysis and Random Forest Models to quantify associations between specific speech motor limitations and phonological error patterns identified via the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology assessment. Results showed moderate associations between phonological error patterns in particular cluster reduction, final consonant deletion, stopping, gliding, and atypical errors and limitations in jaw, labial-facial, and lingual control. Gliding, unexpectedly, demonstrated a negative relationship with speech motor errors, being more prevalent among older and milder cases, suggesting it may reflect a compensatory developmental stage rather than purely phonological simplification. These findings highlight the significance of speech motor constraints in phonological error patterns, challenging traditional cognitive-linguistic explanations. The results support theoretical frameworks such as Articulatory Phonology, emphasizing that phonological error patterns are influenced substantially by articulatory and neuromotor development. This study underscores the need for integrating motor considerations into clinical assessments and interventions for speech sound disorders in children, fostering a comprehensive approach bridging cognitive-linguistic and motor speech perspectives.",

Increasing liana abundance may explain the decaying carbon sink because lianas reduce canopy tree growth and survival, which limits forest carbon storage. However, canopy lianas, not solely understory lianas, would have to be increasing for this hypothesis to be credible because canopy lianas compete especially intensely with canopy trees.

    "title": "Anatomical connectivity-based parcellation of the human orbitofrontal cortex.",
    "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "content": "Limb dominance is a human behavioral characteristic with many cultural, practical, scientific and clinical implications. Yet why the dominant limb performs better across a range of motor skill-requiring tasks remains unanswered. Is it because of an intrinsic hemispheric advantage or instead is it the result of life-long practice with the dominant side? We tested these alternatives using two tasks. The first was 3D reaching with either an inertial challenge or the need to use a stick-like tool. The second required participants to write with their dominant and non-dominant elbows. We applied a novel geometric analysis to quantify movement-trajectory shape. We show that (1) tool-use unmasks markedly inferior control in the non-dominant arm, and this is because it imposes the need to generate unfamiliarly shaped movement trajectories; and (2) there is no general dominant limb motor control advantage, only task-specific experience or practice. These results reframe dominance as predominantly about learned control of kinematics rather than baseline asymmetry in control of dynamics.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "Closed-loop coupling of both physiological spindle model and spinal pathways for sensorimotor control of human center-out reaching",
    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "title": "Autonomous retrieval for continuous learning in associative memory networks",
    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "content": "Schizencephaly is a rare congenital cerebral malformation typically diagnosed in early childhood due to serious neurological manifestations. Our case report described a patient with open lip schizencephaly, notable for three unique aspects. First, the patient experienced epileptic seizures in adulthood, which is atypical compared to the usual onset in childhood. Additionally, the patient reported migraine-like pain occurring seconds before each epileptic seizure, with a short interval and regular occurrence. Finally, contrary to the expected severity of symptoms in a patient with open lip schizencephaly, the patient was able to live independently in daily activities, maintained normal cognitive function, and effectively managed both seizures and headaches with standard medication. The purpose of this report is to highlight the significant role of schizencephaly as a causative factor in adult-onset epilepsy and to emphasize the need for a comprehensive therapeutic approach addressing both the structural and functional aspects of this complex neurodevelopmental condition (under the premise of schizencephaly, there were migraine-like attacks in the short term before epileptic seizures).",

    "content": "Perturbation-evoked potentials (PEPs) have been widely used to investigate static and dynamic perturbations on postural and motor control through analysis of cortical responses. In this pilot study, we present an innovative approach using IoT-based Perturbatory Electrical Stimulation (PES) during treadmill walking to assess cortical responses in healthy adults (N = 6) and individuals with Parkinson's disease (N = 4), with a focus on the N1 component. This approach integrates PES and EEG systems through an Internet of Things (IoT) framework utilizing the MQTT protocol, enabling synchronized and wireless data acquisition during gait. The results indicated significant differences in N1 latency (p = 0.005), with the Parkinson's disease group presenting higher latencies in the N1 component (252.50 \u00b1 32.62 ms) compared to the healthy adult group (175.50 \u00b1 30.42 ms). Significant correlations were observed between N1 amplitude and participants' age (r = 0.669, p = 0.049) and between TUG performance and PES intensity (mA) (r = -0.697, p = 0.037). No significant correlations were found between N1 latency and PES intensity (mA), visible motor threshold (mA), or Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how Parkinson's disease impacts cortical responses to sensorimotor perturbations during gait, particularly regarding sensory processing and motor feedback, and highlight the potential utility of the PES system in future studies in motor control.",

    "content": "Objective. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, encompassing a prodromal stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where patients may either progress to AD or remain stable. The objective of the work was to capture structural and functional modulations of brain structure and function relying on multimodal MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphisms, also in case of missing views, with the twofold goal of classifying AD patients versus healthy controls and detecting MCI converters. Approach. We propose a multimodal deep learning (DL)-based classification framework where a generative module employing cycle generative adversarial networks was introduced in the latent space for imputing missing data (a common issue of multimodal approaches). Explainable AI method was then used to extract input features\u2019 relevance allowing for post-hoc validation and enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. Main results. Experimental results on two tasks, AD detection and MCI conversion, showed that our framework reached competitive performance in the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of (CI [0.90, 0.95]) and (CI [0.70, 0.72]) in the two tasks, respectively. The interpretability analysis revealed gray matter modulations in cortical and subcortical brain areas typically associated with AD. Moreover, impairments in sensory-motor and visual resting state networks along the disease continuum, as well as genetic mutations defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified. Significance. Our integrative and interpretable DL approach shows promising performance for AD detection and MCI prediction while shedding light on important biological insights.",

Brain\u2013computer interfaces hold significant promise for restoring communication in individuals with partial or complete loss of the ability to speak due to paralysis from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, and other neurological disorders. Many of the approaches to speech decoding reported in the BCI literature have required time-aligned target representations to allow successful training\u2014a major challenge when translating such approaches to people who have already lost their voice. Approach. In this pilot study, we made a first step toward scenarios in which no ground truth is available. We utilized a graph-based clustering approach to identify temporal segments of speech production from electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals alone. We then used the estimated speech segments to train a voice activity detection (VAD) model using only ECoG signals. We evaluated our approach using a leave-one-day-out cross-validation on open-loop recordings of a single dysarthric clinical trial participant living with ALS, and we compared the resulting performance to previous solutions trained with ground truth acoustic voice recordings. Main results. Our approach achieves a median timing error of around 530 ms with respect to the actual spoken speech. Embedded into a real-time BCI, our approach is capable of providing VAD results with a latency of only 10 ms. Significance. To the best of our knowledge, our results show for the first time that speech activity can be predicted purely from unlabeled ECoG signals, a crucial step toward individuals who cannot provide this information anymore due to their neurological condition, such as patients with locked-in syndrome.

    "title": "Physiological activity within peripheral nerves influences neural output in response to electrical stimulation: an in vivo study",
    "content": "Objective. Neuromodulation therapies are often applied to peripheral nerves. These nerves can have physiological activity that interacts with the activity evoked by electrical stimulation, potentially influencing targeted neural output and clinical outcomes. Our goal was to quantify changes in sensory neural unit activity in response to variations in electrical stimulation frequency and amplitude. Approach. In a feline model, we applied cutaneous brushing to evoke pudendal nerve afferent activity with and without electrical stimulation via a pudendal nerve cuff electrode. We recorded neural output with microelectrode arrays implanted in ipsilateral sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Main results. Combined inter-spike interval distributions for all DRG units showed ranges of flattening, increases, and shifts in response to electrical stimulation. These distributions and changes within them due to electrical stimulation were largely driven by a select few units. Mixed-effects models revealed that quicker firing units generally decreased in firing rate in response to electrical stimulation and, conversely, slower firing units increased in firing rate. A unit\u2019s underlying firing rate also drove the magnitude of change in mean output firing rate in response to stimulation. Further, the models reported a small, negative correlation between the output mean unit firing rate and the applied electrical stimulation frequency. Significance. These results demonstrate the potential impact of electrical stimulation on underlying neural firing activity and output. Peripheral neuromodulation may normalize abnormal firing patterns in nerves contributing to pathological disorders or alter unrelated physiological activity in off-target neurons. These factors should be considered when selecting neuromodulation settings in animal subjects and human patients.",

    "title": "Disentangling indirect versus direct effects of somatosensory cortex microstimulation on neurons in primary motor and ventral premotor cortex",
    "content": "Objective. Intracortical microstimulation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1-ICMS) is being developed to provide on-line feedback for bidirectional brain\u2013machine interfaces. Because S1-ICMS can alter the discharge of the motor cortex neurons used to decode motor intent, successful application of S1-ICMS feedback requires understanding the modulation it produces in motor cortex neuron activity. Approach. We investigated the effects of S1-ICMS on neurons in both the primary motor cortex (M1) and the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) during a task in which some trials were instructed with visual cues and other trials with S1-ICMS. Main results. We observed both indirect modulation during and/or after ICMS trains, as well as direct modulation time-locked to the individual S1-ICMS pulses within trains, with all possible combinations of the two types of modulation found among the majority of M1 and PMv neurons. Indirect effects were more prevalent and larger than direct effects. When S1-ICMS produced both indirect and direct modulation in the same neuron, the effects could both be excitatory, both inhibitory, or one excitatory and the other inhibitory. By simulating direct effects, we isolated the concurrent indirect effects, revealing that isolated direct effects failed to account for isolated indirect effects. Furthermore, indirect effects could be present 1 s or more after ICMS trains had terminated, when no direct effects could have occurred. Although the performance of movement decoders trained on visually-instructed trials was poor when applied to ICMS-instructed trials, decoders trained on ICMS-instructed trials performed well on ICMS-instructed trials, indicating that S1-ICMS altered the discharge of M1 and PMv neurons but did not degrade the decodable information available. Significance. When decoding movement intent from neural activity in M1 and/or PMv, accounting for indirect and direct modulation may improve the ability of bidirectional brain\u2013machine interfaces to incorporate artificial somatosensory feedback delivered with S1-ICMS and restore functional movement.",

    "title": "EEG workload estimation and classification: a systematic review",
    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) has evolved into an indispensable instrument for estimating cognitive workload in various domains. Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly employed to develop accurate workload estimation and classification models based on EEG data. The goal of this systematic review is to compile the body of research on EEG workload estimation and classification using ML and DL approaches. Methods. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures were followed in conducting the review, searches were conducted through databases at SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Science Direct from the beginning to the end of 16 February 2024. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted to capture study design, participant demographics, EEG features, ML/DL algorithms, and reported performance metrics. Results. Out of the 125 items that emerged, 33 scientific papers were fully evaluated. The study designs, participant demographics, and EEG workload measurement and categorization techniques used in the investigations differed. Support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and hybrid networks are examples of ML and DL approaches that were often used. Analyzing the accuracy scores achieved by different ML/DL models. Furthermore, a relationship was noted between sample frequency and model accuracy, with higher sample frequencies generally leading to improved performance. The percentage distribution of ML/DL methods revealed that SVMs, CNNs, and recurrent neural networks were the most commonly utilized techniques, reflecting their robustness in handling EEG data. Significance. The comprehensive review emphasizes how ML may be used to identify mental workload across a variety of disciplines using EEG data. Optimizing practical applications requires multimodal data integration, standardization efforts, and real-world validation studies. These systems will also be further improved by addressing ethical issues and investigating new EEG properties, which will improve human\u2013computer interaction and performance assessment.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">First, I guess I should've avoided the word \"rhetorical.\" &nbsp;In my post, I characterized Ioannidis's 2005 claim, type M and S errors, and multiverse analysis as \"rhetorical tools\" that have been been useful in the field of science criticism but which I would not use in my own analyses. &nbsp;I could've added to this many other statistical methods including p-values and Bayes factors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One very obvious way to see that I never thought Type M and Type S errors \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis'\" is that, since the appearance of that article in 2014, I've published dozens of applied papers, and in only very few of these did I look at Type M and Type S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Finally, a few things in your post that I did not address above:</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

    "content": "arXiv:2510.08104v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence has become integral to organizational decision-making and while research has explored many facets of this human-AI collaboration, the focus has mainly been on designing the AI agent(s) and the way the collaboration is set up - generally assuming a human decision-maker to be \"fixed\". However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental models necessary for this collaboration. We develop an integrated socio-technical framework that identifies the mechanisms driving the mental model evolution: data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and performance feedback. Our work advances human-AI collaboration literature through three key contributions: introducing three distinct mental models (domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness); recognizing the dynamic nature of mental models; and establishing mechanisms that guide the purposeful design of effective human-AI collaboration.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.07987v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Today's virtual reality (VR) systems and environments assume that users have typical abilities, which can make VR inaccessible to people with physical impairments. However, there is not yet an understanding of how inaccessible locomotion techniques are, and which interactions make them inaccessible. To this end, we conducted a study in which people with and without upper-body impairments navigated a virtual environment with six locomotion techniques to quantify performance differences among groups. We found that groups performed similarly with Sliding Looking on all performance measures, suggesting that this might be a good default locomotion technique for VR apps. To understand the nature of performance differences with the other techniques, we collected low-level interaction data from the controllers and headset and analyzed interaction differences with a set of movement-, button-, and target-related metrics. We found that movement-related metrics from headset data reveal differences among groups with all techniques, suggesting these are good metrics for identifying whether a user has an upper-body impairment. We also identify movement-, button, and target- related metrics that can explain performance differences between groups for particular locomotion techniques.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.07967v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Lost architectural heritage presents interpretive challenges due to vanished structures and fragmented historical records. Using Hanyuan Hall of the Tang dynasty's Daming Palace as a case study, we conducted a formative investigation with archaeologists, heritage administrators, and visitors to identify key issues in current interpretation practices. We found that these practices often compress complex cultural layers into factual summaries and rely on linear narratives that overlook the continuing reinterpretations following a site's disappearance. In response, we designed Pre/Absence, a virtual reality experience grounded in the presence-absence dialectic to interweave tangible and vanished aspects of heritage within a spatiotemporal narrative. A mixed-method study with 28 participants compared Pre/Absence to a paper-based experience. Both improved users' factual understanding, but the VR experience more strongly enhanced cultural awareness, evoked emotional engagement with loss, and encouraged critical reflection on the evolving social and political meanings of heritage. The findings suggest that VR can move beyond static reconstruction to engage users as co-constructors of cultural meaning, providing a nuanced framework for critical heritage narrative design in human-computer interaction.",

    "title": "A Systematic Evaluation of Self-Supervised Learning for Label-Efficient Sleep Staging with Wearable EEG",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.07960v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Wearable EEG devices have emerged as a promising alternative to polysomnography (PSG). As affordable and scalable solutions, their widespread adoption results in the collection of massive volumes of unlabeled data that cannot be analyzed by clinicians at scale. Meanwhile, the recent success of deep learning for sleep scoring has relied on large annotated datasets. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an opportunity to bridge this gap, leveraging unlabeled signals to address label scarcity and reduce annotation effort. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for sleep staging using wearable EEG. We investigate a range of well-established SSL methods and evaluate them on two sleep databases acquired with the Ikon Sleep wearable EEG headband: BOAS, a high-quality benchmark containing PSG and wearable EEG recordings with consensus labels, and HOGAR, a large collection of home-based, self-recorded, and unlabeled recordings. Three evaluation scenarios are defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and cross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains particularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade accuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the supervised approach requires twice the labels. Additionally, SSL representations prove robust to variations in population characteristics, recording environments, and signal quality. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SSL to enable label-efficient sleep staging with wearable EEG, reducing reliance on manual annotations and advancing the development of affordable sleep monitoring systems.",

Traditional models that emphasise the organisation and retrieval of pre-existing information are increasingly inadequate in the face of generative AI (GenAI) systems capable of autonomous content creation. This paper introduces the Knowledge Sculptor (KS), a new professional archetype for Human-GenAI collaboration that transforms raw AI output into trustworthy, actionable knowledge. Grounded in a socio-technical perspective, the KS is conceptualised through a framework of competencies, including architecting a vision, iterative dialogue, information sculpting, and curiosity-driven synthesis. A practice-based vignette illustrates the KS role in action, and in a self-referential approach, the paper itself serves as an artefact of the sculpting process it describes.",

However, it often requires numerous iterations due to the lack of prior information. While recent approaches have accelerated this process by leveraging previous optimization data, collecting user data remains costly and often impractical. We present a conceptual framework, Human-in-the-Loop Optimization with Model-Informed Priors (HOMI), which augments human-in-the-loop optimization with a training phase where the optimizer learns adaptation strategies from diverse, synthetic user data generated with predictive models before deployment. To realize HOMI, we introduce Neural Acquisition Function+ (NAF+), a Bayesian optimization method featuring a neural acquisition function trained with reinforcement learning. NAF+ learns optimization strategies from large-scale synthetic data, improving efficiency in real-time optimization with users. We evaluate HOMI and NAF+ with mid-air keyboard optimization, a representative VR input task. Our work presents a new approach for more efficient interface adaptation by bridging in situ and in silico optimization processes.",

In this phase, we seek to radically simplify the creation of virtual environments, thereby broadening the potential group of users who could benefit from them. The research described in this paper has three aspects. First, we define the concept of \"slow space,\" situating it alongside existing research in HCI and environmental psychology. Second, we report on a series of interviews with professional designers about how slow spaces are created in the physical world. Third, we share the design of the tool itself, focussing on the benefits of providing a simple method for users to control their environments. We conclude with our findings from a 19-person qualitative study of the tool.",

We present IGUANA, an MR-based immersive guidance, navigation, and control system for consumer UAVs. IGUANA introduces three key elements beyond conventional control interfaces: (1) a 3D terrain map interface with draggable waypoint markers and live camera preview for high-level control, (2) a novel spatial control metaphor that uses a virtual ball as a physical analogy for low-level control, and (3) a spatial overlay that helps track the UAV when it is not visible with the naked eye or visual line of sight is interrupted. We conducted a user study to evaluate our design, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and found that (1) the 3D map interface is intuitive and easy to use, relieving users from manual control and suggesting improved accuracy and consistency with lower perceived workload relative to conventional dual-stick controller, (2) the virtual ball interface is intuitive but limited by the lack of physical feedback, and (3) the spatial overlay is very useful in enhancing the users' situational awareness.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.07321v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to replace consumers (e.g., synthetic data), it is often assumed that AI emulates established consumers, and more generally human behaviors. Ten experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs) investigate if this is true in the domain of well-documented biases and heuristics. Across studies we observe four distinct types of deviations from human-like behavior. First, in some cases, LLMs reduce or correct biases observed in humans. Second, in other cases, LLMs amplify these same biases. Third, and perhaps most intriguingly, LLMs sometimes exhibit biases opposite to those found in humans. Fourth, LLMs' responses to the same (or similar) prompts tend to be inconsistent (a) within the same model after a time delay, (b) across models, and (c) among independent research studies. Such inconsistencies can be uncharacteristic of humans and suggest that, at least at one point, LLMs' responses differed from humans. Overall, unhuman-like responses are problematic when LLMs are used to mimic or predict consumer behavior. These findings complement research on synthetic consumer data by showing that sources of bias are not necessarily human-centric. They also contribute to the debate about the tasks for which consumers, and more generally humans, can be replaced by AI.",

    "content": "arXiv:2205.10723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Neuronal circuits arise as axons and dendrites extend, navigate, and connect to target cells. Axonal growth, in particular, integrates deterministic guidance from substrate mechanics and geometry with stochastic fluctuations generated by signaling, molecular detection, cytoskeletal assembly, and growth cone dynamics. A comprehensive quantitative description of this process remains incomplete. We review stochastic models in which Langevin dynamics and the associates Fokker-Planck equation capture axonal motion and turning under combined biases and noise. Paired with experiments, these models yield key parameters, including effective diffusion (motility) coefficients, speed and angle distributions, mean-square displacement, and mechanical measures of cell-substrate coupling, thereby linking single-cell biophysics and intercellular interactions to collective growth statistics and network formation. We further couple the Fokker-Planck description to a mechanochemical actin-myosin-clutch model and perform a linear stability analysis of the resulting dynamics. Routh--Hurwitz criteria identify regimes of steady extension, damped oscillations, and Hopf bifurcations that generate sustained limit cycles. Together, these results clarify the mechanisms that govern axonal guidance and connectivity and inform the design of engineered substrates and neuroprosthetic scaffolds aimed at enhancing nerve repair and regeneration.",

Computational models reconstructed the faces participants looked at during natural interactions, including facial expressions and motion, from brain activity alone. The results highlighted a critical role for the social vision pathway, a network of areas spanning parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. This network was more sharply tuned to subtle expressions compared to intense expressions, which was confirmed with controlled psychophysical experiments. These findings reveal that the human social vision pathway encodes facial expressions and motion as deviations from a neutral expression prototype during natural social interactions in real life.",

    "content": "arXiv:2502.16456v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Category-selective regions in the human brain-such as the fusiform face area (FFA), extrastriate body area (EBA), parahippocampal place area (PPA), and visual word form area (VWFA)-support high-level visual recognition. Here, we investigate whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit analogous category-selective neurons and how these representations are shaped by language experience. Using an fMRI-inspired functional localizer approach, we identified face-, body-, place-, and word-selective neurons in deep networks presented with category images and scrambled controls. Both the purely visual ResNet and a linguistically supervised Lang-Learned ResNet contained category-selective neurons that increased in proportion across layers. However, compared to the vision-only model, the Lang-Learned ResNet showed a greater number but lower specificity of category-selective neurons, along with reduced spatial localization and attenuated activation strength-indicating a shift toward more distributed, semantically aligned coding. These effects were replicated in the large-scale vision-language model CLIP. Together, our findings reveal that language experience systematically reorganizes visual category representations in ANNs, providing a computational parallel to how linguistic context may shape categorical organization in the human brain.",

    "title": "Spike-frequency and h-current based adaptation are dynamically equivalent in a Wilson-Cowan field model",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.08436v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: During slow-wave sleep, the brain produces traveling waves of slow oscillations (SOs; $\\leq 2$ Hz), characterized by the propagation of alternating high- and low-activity states. The question of internal mechanisms that modulate traveling waves of SOs is still unanswered although it is established that it is an adaptation mechanism that mediates them. One mechanism investigated is spike-frequency adaptation, a hyperpolarizing feedback current that is activated during periods of high-activity. An alternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which are positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both adaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal populations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable differences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a spatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial coupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two adaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and include the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength and gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent under a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength, leading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation structure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves. Additionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal activity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of the traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength. Though being dynamically equivalent, our results also explain why location-dependent variations in feedback strength cause differences in the propagation of traveling waves between both adaptation mechanisms.",

Although acute treatments have advanced, recovery remains challenging and limited. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a promising tool for post-stroke rehabilitation by promoting neuroplasticity. However, clinical outcomes remain variable, and optimal protocols have yet to be established. This study explores strategies to optimize BCI-based rehabilitation by comparing motor imagery of affected hand movement versus rest, instead of the conventional left-versus-right motor imagery. This alternative aims to simplify the task and address the weak contralateral activation commonly observed in stroke patients. Two datasets, one from healthy individuals and one from stroke patients, were used to evaluate the proposed approach. The results showed improved performance using both FBCSP and EEGNet. Additionally, we investigated the impact of session duration and found that shorter training sessions produced better BCI performance than longer sessions.",

    "title": "Monkey Perceptogram: Reconstructing Visual Representation and Presumptive Neural Preference from Monkey Multi-electrode Arrays",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.07576v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how the primate brain transforms complex visual scenes into coherent perceptual experiences remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Here, we present a comprehensive framework for interpreting monkey visual processing by integrating encoding and decoding approaches applied to two large-scale spiking datasets recorded from macaque using THINGS images (THINGS macaque IT Dataset (TITD) and THINGS Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset (TVSD)). We leverage multi-electrode array recordings from the ventral visual stream--including V1, V4, and inferotemporal (IT) cortex--to investigate how distributed neural populations encode and represent visual information. Our approach employs linear models to decode spiking activity into multiple latent visual spaces (including CLIP and VDVAE embeddings) and reconstruct images using state-of-the-art generative models. We further utilize encoding models to map visual features back to neural activity, enabling visualization of the \"preferred stimuli\" that drive specific neural ensembles. Analyses of both datasets reveal that it is possible to reconstruct both low-level (e.g., color, texture) and high-level (e.g., semantic category) features of visual stimuli from population activity, with reconstructions preserving key perceptual attributes as quantified by feature-based similarity metrics. The spatiotemporal spike patterns reflect the ventral stream's hierarchical organization with anterior regions representing complex objects and categories. Functional clustering identifies feature-specific neural ensembles, with temporal dynamics show evolving feature selectivity post-stimulus. Our findings demonstrate feasible, generalizable perceptual reconstruction from large-scale monkey neural recordings, linking neural activity to perception.",

    "title": "Beyond Grid-Locked Voxels: Neural Response Functions for Continuous Brain Encoding",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.07342v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neural encoding models aim to predict fMRI-measured brain responses to natural images. fMRI data is acquired as a 3D volume of voxels, where each voxel has a defined spatial location in the brain. However, conventional encoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel responses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards anatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid. We introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI activity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat vector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit function: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI space, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation decouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary spatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the model in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses: (1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns; modeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data efficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data across individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned on new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both intrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance while reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, NRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened voxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D space.",

    "title": "Rapid inversion of singleton distractor representations underlies learned attentional suppression",
    "content": "In visually complex and dynamically changing environments, humans often face the challenge of filtering out salient stimuli that are presently irrelevant to their tasks. Recent evidence suggests that through repeated exposure to search arrays containing salient color singleton distractors, individuals can learn to divert their attention away from such salient but irrelevant stimuli, even before they capture attention. However, the mechanisms underlying such attentional suppression remain unclear. The current study examined trajectories of singleton distractor representations during visual searches to address this gap. Using multivariate pattern analyses on EEG data (N = 40), we found that singleton distractor representations underwent a rapid inversion approximately 200 ms into the search. These inverted representations were coded in a shared subspace with target representations, but in a reversed orientation, presumably to downweight their salience in the spatial priority map. Target locations were consistently enhanced compared to non-singleton distractors, while singleton distractors were suppressed. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of rapid representational transformation underlying salient distractor suppression at the onset of visual search. The rapid inversion of pop-out singleton distractor signals resulted in an inverted arrangement of target and distractor representations in a shared neural subspace, which facilitates subsequent read-out of both target enhancement and distractor suppression signals in the computation of spatial priorities to successfully guide search.",

    "title": "HypoAD: volumetric and single-cell analysis reveals changes in the human hypothalamus in aging and Alzheimer's disease",
    "content": "Alterations in metabolism, stress response, sleep, circadian rhythms, and neuroendocrine processes are key features of aging and neurodegeneration. These fundamental processes are regulated by the hypothalamus, yet how its functionally distinct subregions and cell types change during human aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains largely unexplored. Here, we present HypoAD, a comprehensive atlas of the human hypothalamus in aging and AD, integrating high-resolution MRI from 202 individuals with single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of 614,403 nuclei from young, AD, and age-matched non-dementia controls. Our analysis reveals that hypothalamic subregions governing metabolism, stress, and circadian rhythms are particularly vulnerable, exhibiting significant changes in both volumes and gene expression during aging and AD. At the molecular level, machine learning models identified the inflammatory response and regulators of circadian rhythms as key cellular predictors of AD. These signatures were reflected in specific cell types: microglia transitioned to a pro-inflammatory state, while inhibitory neurons within sleep- and circadian-regulating hypothalamic subregions showed the most profound transcriptional alterations, including disruptions in ligand-receptor interactions and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. Together, HypoAD provides a high-resolution volumetric map and a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of the human hypothalamus in aging and AD, linking lifestyle and behavioral changes to their underlying volumetric and molecular pathways. Additionally, HypoAD provides a framework to investigate hypothalamic dysfunction and establishes a roadmap for targeted interventions aimed at mitigating physiological disruptions to potentially slow disease progression.",

    "title": "Differences in layer-specific activation of the insula during interoceptive vs. exteroceptive attention",
    "content": "Attention modulates the relative weighting of information and plays a critical role in modern theories of perception. While its role in exteroception - the perception of the external environment - has been extensively studied, attentional processes in interoception, the perception of bodily states, are less well understood. In this study, we exploited high-field (7 Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging and concurrent field monitoring to investigate interoceptive attention at the level of cortical layers during a heartbeat attention task. Voxel-wise analyses reveal increased activity in the bilateral dorsal mid-insula during interoceptive attention (attending to one's heartbeat) compared to exteroceptive attention (attending to auditory white noise). Layer-specific analyses further demonstrate that this difference in activity is significantly higher in upper compared to lower cortical layers. This activation pattern persists after accounting for potential vascular artifacts through a deconvolution analysis with a physiological point spread function (PSF). To our knowledge, these findings represent the first empirical demonstration of layer-specific processes during interoceptive attention in human cortex. They may prove useful to inform and constrain theories of computational principles and physiological implementation of interoception.",

    "content": "We introduce a vision transformer (ViT)-based approach for automated electrographic seizure classification using time-frequency spectrogram representations of intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected from patients implanted with the NeuroPace\u00ae RNS\u00ae System. The ViT model was trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on a large-scale dataset of 136,878 iEEG recordings from 113 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, achieving an average test accuracy of 96.8%. Clinical validation was performed on an independent expert-labeled dataset of 3,010 iEEG recordings from 241 patients, where the model achieved 95.8% accuracy and 94.8% F1 score on recordings with unanimous expert agreement, outperforming both ResNet-50 and standard 2D CNN baselines. To evaluate generalizability, the model was tested on a separate out-of-distribution dataset of 136 recordings from 44 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), achieving over 75% accuracy and F1 scores across all expert comparisons. Explainability analysis revealed focused attention on characteristic electrographic seizure patterns within iEEG time-frequency spectrograms during high-confidence seizure predictions, while more diffuse attention was observed in non-seizure classifications, providing insight into the underlying decision process. By enabling reliable electrographic seizure classification, this approach may assist physicians in the manual review of large volumes of iEEG recordings.",

    "content": "Neuropsychological tests are essential tools for evaluating dementia and related neurocognitive disorders, with their clinical utility determined mainly by their validity. This paper critically reviews the diverse evidence supporting the validity of neuropsychological tests in dementia assessment. Criterion validity is discussed in relation to the tests\u2019 ability to predict clinical diagnoses and underlying brain pathology, with a focus on their sensitivity to functional impairments and progressive neuropathological changes. Construct validity is explored through the lens of cognitive processes underlying test performance, using evidence from correlation structures and experimental paradigms. Furthermore, the paper examines the impact of emerging digital technologies on the evaluation of neuropsychological test validity, highlighting contrasts with traditional validation methods. The review identifies discrepancies between different types of validity evidence, emphasizing the need to contextualize validity within specific clinical and research applications. By addressing the conceptual limitations and trade-offs between validation approaches, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for interpreting validity evidence. Ultimately, it offers theoretical and practical implications for enhancing the robustness of neuropsychological tests in clinical practice and research.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "title": "Proof of concept for high-dose Cannabidiol pretreatment to antagonize opioid induced persistent apnea in mice",
    "content": "BackgroundOpioid related fatalities remain a public health crisis in the US. Currently, the only way to restore breathing following an opioid induced persistent apnea is with the administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone, but it also reverses analgesia, euphoria, and induces precipitated withdrawal in opioid dependent individuals.MethodsUsing whole-body plethysmography, we assessed changes in breathing frequency in awake behaving mice resulting from a single fentanyl dose (50\u202fmg/kg\u202fi.p.) that followed i.p. pretreatment with saline, vehicle, naloxone (100\u202fmg/kg), cannabidiol (CBD) (250\u202fmg/kg), or CBD\u202f+\u202fnaloxone. Then we assessed the delay to opioid-induced persistent apnea (OIPA) and the median lethal dose (LD50) of fentanyl during a continuous i.c.v. infusion of fentanyl (100\u202fng/min), in urethane anesthetized mice, following pretreatment with saline, vehicle, naloxone (100\u202fmg/kg), CBD (250\u202fmg/kg), or CBD\u202f+\u202fnaloxone i.p.ResultsHere we show acute pretreatment with CBD is as effective as naloxone at preventing opioid-induced respiratory depression from fentanyl in awake mice, and increasing LD50 of fentanyl in urethane anesthetized mice. When pre-administered together, CBD\u202f+\u202fnaloxone, increased LD50 of fentanyl even more than CBD or naloxone alone in urethane anesthetized mice.ConclusionCBD may be an effective preventative therapy for OIPA by increasing the time before apnea onset and potentially enhancing the efficacy of naloxone as an additional strategy to save lives.",

    "content": "Emotional perception plays a crucial role in social interaction; however, previous studies have majorly focused on static emotion perception rather than examining how emotions unfold during communication. Therefore, this study investigated how psychological distance (friends vs. stranger pairs) and topic type (shared vs. exclusive experiences) modulate inter-brain synchronization (IBS) during emotional communication, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results showed that: (1) shared story (vs. exclusive story) elicited higher levels of emotion perception, both for self and other (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), and friends (vs. stranger) perceived their friends\u2019 negative emotions more strongly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). (2) Higher IBS was observed at the right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG; BA 10) when shared story in friend than shared story in stranger (p_FWE < 0.05). The results indicate that with the deepening of friendships, the overlap between the two parties increases, resulting in higher emotional resonance when sharing common experiences. These findings provide brain imaging evidence supporting the involvement of emotion perception during communication.",

    "content": "IntroductionFocal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is one of the common causes of refractory epilepsy. The subtle and indistinct edge of FCD lesions pose considerable challenges for accurate lesion localization. Therefore, we propose an edge guided segmentation network based on Laplacian pyramid to improve the localization performance of FCD lesions.MethodsThis is a retrospective study evaluated on two independent datasets. The proposed Laplacian Edge Mix UNet (LEM-UNet) builds upon the MedNeXt baseline and incorporates the Laplacian Edge Attention (LEA) block and the Multi-strategy Feature Fusion (MFF) block. LEA block captures lesion details and edge information during the encoding phase by integrating Laplacian pyramid feature maps with an attention mechanism, while MFF block fuses edge features with high level features during the decoding phase.ResultsThe model's performance was assessed through 5-fold cross-validation across both Open and Private Datasets, demonstrating superior performance. The average Dice Coefficient achieved 0.452 and 0.597 on the Open and Private Datasets, respectively, representing improvements of 2.40% and 2.90% compared to the baseline model.DiscussionThe results demonstrate the importance of focusing on lesion edge in the FCD segmentation task. The integration of the Laplacian pyramid enhances the mode's ability to capture lesions with blurred edge and subtle features. LEM-UNet exhibits significant advantages over current FCD segmentation algorithms. The source code and pre trained model weights are available at https://github.com/simplify403/LEM-UNet.",

While the tactile sensibility of the hand has been extensively characterized, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of...",

However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability.
