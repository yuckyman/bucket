    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks).

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

    "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

    "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

    "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

    "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

    "content": "Humans operating in dynamic environments with limited visibility are susceptible to collisions with moving objects, occupational hazards, and/or other agents, which can result in personal injuries or fatalities. Most existing research has focused on using vibrotactile cues to address this challenge. In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach that utilizes variable impedance on an active exoskeleton to guide humans away from hazards and towards safe areas. This framework combines artificial potential fields with current impedance-based theories of exoskeleton control to provide a comprehensive navigational system that is intuitive for human operators. First, we present the mathematical framework to encode information about the locations of obstacles and the safest direction in which to move. Next, we optimize controller parameters in a series of human-subject experiments. Finally, we evaluate the framework in virtual reality on a set of randomly generated obstacle fields in environments where vision is either fully or partially occluded. Our results suggest that the exoskeleton provides significant separation from obstacles and reduced collisions compared to vision alone in conditions where visibility was limited to less than 1.3 m. Our work demonstrates that force-feedback in parallel with a human can improve overall navigation ability in low visibility conditions.",

    "content": "During haptic rendering, a visual display and a haptic interface are commonly utilized together to elicit multi-sensory perception of a virtual object, through a combination and integration of force-related and movement-related cues. In this study, we explore visual-haptic cue integration during multi-modal haptic rendering under conflicting cues and propose a systematic means to determine the optimal visual scaling for haptic manipulation that maximizes the perceived realism of spring rendering for a given haptic interface. We show that the parameters affecting visual-haptic congruency can be effectively optimized through a qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization to ensure a consistently high rating of perceived realism. Accordingly, the multi-modal perception of users can be successfully enhanced by solely modulating the visual feedback without altering the haptic feedback, to make virtual environments feel stiffer or more compliant, significantly extending the range of perceived stiffness levels for a haptic interface. We extend our results to a group of individuals to capture the multi-dimensional psychometric field that characterizes the cumulative effect of feedback modalities utilized during sensory cue integration under conflicts. Our results not only provide reliable estimates of just noticeable difference thresholds for stiffness with and without visual scaling but also capture all the prominent features of sensory cue integration, indicating weights that are proportional to the congruency level of manipulated visual signals. Overall, preference-based HiL optimization excels as a systematic and efficient method of studying multi-modal perception under conflicts.",

While its sensory effects are extensively studied, investigations into the reaction time (RT) following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate how stimulation parameters influence RT. We examined RT and RT variability among twenty healthy participants aged 21 to 61 years. Participants underwent 16 stimulation patterns (10 repetitions per pattern) with combinations of four pulse frequencies (4, 26, 48, 70 Hz) and four pulse amplitudes (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times of sensory threshold) on four skin locations in the lower leg above peroneal nerve, tibial nerve, tibialis anterior muscle, and a lateral shank control site. RT was assessed as participants dorsiflexed their foot in response to electrical stimulation. Results revealed that both RT and its variability decreased as pulse frequency and amplitude increased, and there was an interaction effect between pulse frequency and amplitude. However, no significant difference was found in RT across stimulation locations. These findings demonstrate how stimulation parameters affect the speed and efficiency of communication between the user and the stimulator, showing promises for augmenting real-time feedback HMIs.",

    "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
    "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",

    "content": "This study investigates a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, aiming to develop a non-contact, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational solution for healthcare applications. A 60 GHz mmWave radar system was employed to collect radar point cloud data from 45 participants performing STS motions. Using a deep learning-based pose estimation model and Inverse Kinematics (IK), we calculated joint angles, segmented STS motions, and extracted clinically relevant features for fall risk assessment. The extracted features were compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. While Kinect provided a reference for motion capture, we acknowledge its limitations compared to the gold-standard VICON system, which is planned for future validation. The results demonstrated that mmWave radar effectively captures general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk), though challenges remain for more fine-grained motion analysis. This study highlights the unique advantages and limitations of mmWave radar and other sensors, emphasizing the potential of integrated sensor technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Future work will expand the scope to more complex movements and incorporate high-precision motion capture systems to further validate the findings.",

    "content": "Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), reflecting the duration from the onset to the end of blood ejection by the left ventricle during each heartbeat, is a critical parameter for measuring cardiac pumping efficiency. Continuous and regular monitoring of LVET is particularly crucial in assessing cardiac health, valvular function, and myocardial contractility. Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can be utilized for LVET monitoring, as the temporal distance between the aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC) in SCG signals can accurately depict LVET. This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF. We validated the effectiveness of our AO and AC detection algorithm on a self-made dataset comprising 21 participants with 9616 SCG cycles. The benchmark shows that the detection accuracy for AO and AC reached 98.16% and 97.94%, respectively, with an mean absolute error of 0.5571 ms for LVET estimation. The results demonstrate that camera-SCG has strong potential for cardiac health monitoring.",

    "content": "The increasing demand for wearables necessitates efficient energy harvesting and wireless power transfer solutions. Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering (EQS-HBP) is a promising technology for wirelessly powering on-body devices, offering enhanced received power ($P_{rx}$) with full-body coverage. Unlike EQS Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which optimizes channel capacity, EQS-HBP focuses on maximizing ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, requiring a distinct biophysical model tailored to lower termination impedance ranges where ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ peaks. This paper presents comprehensive simulations\u2014finite element method (FEM), distributed circuit modeling\u2014and in-vivo experiments to characterize the body channel as a finite impedance wire, with impedance determined by body dimensions. Contact impedance between the body and receiver, inversely related to contact area, significantly affects ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, necessitating careful design for devices with small contact areas. Furthermore, the body cross-sectional area influences voltage recovery after the point of load, with smaller cross-sections yielding reduced recovery. A lumped circuit model is developed to encapsulate these findings with circuit techniques to maximize ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, demonstrating that series resonance in a ground-floated receiver reduces input impedance by over 65x and improves ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ by more than 25\u00d7 over parallel resonance. We also propose a method to approximate optimal loading impedance for various receiver configurations and analyze the impact of inductor Q factor. We prove that neither series nor parallel resonance can mitigate the transmitter return path capacitance. These insights enable the development of a much higher on-body wireless power transfer method, advancing wearable device technology for applications in healthcare, fitness, and beyond.",

    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

Developing countermeasures to reduce this negative effect is necessary for sensorimotor control as astronauts prepare to explore the Moon. Head-elevated supine lying has been found to be an effective method in simulating the physiological impact of hypogravity by reducing the weight-bearing capacity through the lower limbs. This study investigated whether wearing a combined compression...",

    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War have profoundly affected individuals worldwide, eliciting heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and fear. This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Anti-ELAB) was a 7-month large-scale and highly traumatic social movement in Hong Kong that began in March 2019 in opposition to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government to amend its extradition laws. Using a sample of 112 Chinese young adult (74 females, 38 males, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.83) residents in Hong Kong, this article reports an investigation into relationships between trauma (as manifested in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), dream content (dream motifs, classified according to persecution or ego ideal delusional inclinations), and nightmare distress, all recalled by participants in relation to personal experiences of the Anti-ELAB. The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay. Potential explanations for the findings as well as their implications for further research and clinical practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "Estimating the Mean: Behavioral and Neural Correlates of Summary Representations for Time Intervals",
    "content": "Our behavior is guided by the statistical regularities in the environment. Prior research on temporal context effects has highlighted the dynamic processes through which humans adapt to the environment's temporal regularities. Whereas earlier approaches have focused on the adaptation to traces of previous individual events, real-world performance often requires extracting and retaining summary statistics (e.g., the mean) of temporal distributions. To investigate these summary representations for temporal distributions and to test their sensitivity to distributional changes, we explicitly asked participants to extract the mean of different distributions of time intervals, which shared the same mean but varied in their variability specifically operationalized by the width and presentation frequency of the intervals. Our findings showed that the variability of the estimated mean increased with the distributions' variability, even though the actual mean remained constant. We further examined how such learning of temporal distributions modulates EEG signals during subsequent temporal judgments. An analysis revealed that the contingent negative variation, predictive of single-trial RTs, was correlated with how much individuals' estimates of the mean were affected by the distributions' variability. Conversely, the postinterval P2 was not modulated by the distributions but predicted participants' responses, suggesting that P2 reflects the perceived duration of an interval. Taken together, our results demonstrate not only that humans can accurately estimate the mean of a temporal distribution but also that the representation of the mean becomes more uncertain as the variability of the distribution increases, as reflected neurally in the preparation-related contingent negative variation during temporal decisions.",

    "content": "Unexpected words within a context elicit large N400 brain potentials. However, sometimes the N400 at an unexpected word is small when stereotypical agent and patient roles are reversed, such as at \u201carrested\u201d in \u201cthe cop that the thief arrested.\u201d In a study of 74 native German speakers, we demonstrate evidence that readers can avoid this so-called N400 semantic illusion if the verb is delayed with neutral information such as \u201cthat evening,\u201d but are less able to do so if the delay contains cues that could further strengthen the canonical interpretation, such as \u201cwith handcuffs.\u201d In doing so, we provide a conceptual replication of a relatively new finding and extend previous research by showing that the semantic content of the delay is important. Moreover, we demonstrate evidence that the effect of only the neutral delay increases as the experiment progresses. We propose an interpretation of these findings with reference to the Sentence Gestalt model [Rabovsky, M., Hansen, S. S., & McClelland, J. L. Modelling the N400 brain potential as change in a probabilistic representation of meaning. Nature Human Behaviour, 2, 693, 2018], which accounts for the initial illusion as resulting from uncertainty and an erroneous interpretation based on a strong semantic attractor. Two additional, novel contributions of the work are a demonstration that the illusion can be elicited in German, despite its explicit subject\u2013object case marking, and an exploration of illusion effect among individual readers.",

    "title": "Do Corollary Discharges Contain Information About the Volume of Inner Speech? An ERP Study",
    "content": "When we move our articulator organs to produce overt speech, the brain generates a corollary discharge that acts to suppress the neural and perceptual responses to our speech sounds. Recent research shows that inner speech\u2014the silent production of words in one's mind\u2014is accompanied by a corollary discharge that contains information about the timing and content of inner speech. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this corollary discharge contains information about the volume of inner speech. To investigate this, participants watched an animation that provided them with precise knowledge about when they should produce a \u201cloud\u201d or \u201cquiet\u201d inner sound. At the same time, they heard an audible sound that was either similar or dissimilar to the volume of the inner sound. We found that producing the inner sound attenuated the N1\u2014an ERP signature of auditory processing\u2014and enhanced the slow negative wave\u2014an ERP signature of anticipation and motor preparation\u2014compared with listening, regardless of whether the volume of the inner sound was similar or dissimilar to the audible sound. We also found that the volume of the inner sound did not differentially modulate the N1 or slow negative wave. We speculate that this might be because one of the functions of corollary discharge is to protect our auditory receptors from desensitization caused by audible sounds, and this might be redundant in the context of inner speech because inner speech does not produce an audible sound. We conclude that there might be a functional difference between the neural processes that underlie the production of inner and overt speech.",

    "content": "Contralateral delay activity (CDA) is a measure used to assess the amount of information being stored in visual working memory (VWM). However, it has also been suggested that CDA reflects the current focus of spatial attention, as seen in the multiple object tracking task. This study aimed to determine whether the CDA observed in the multiple object tracking task is driven by VWM storage demands, potentially stemming from the feature (cue) masking of target features. To test this, we manipulated whether participants needed to remember the tracked items under masked or unmasked conditions during the tracking phase. Our experiment revealed that CDA occurred in both conditions; the amplitude of CDA was sensitive to the tracking load only in the masked condition. These findings suggest that CDA reflects both sustained attentional activation and representational storage, with the tracking load influencing CDA only when storage in VWM is required. These results support the conclusion that CDA is primarily sensitive to VWM storage rather than the current focus of spatial attention.",

    "content": "This study investigates the role of theta frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in enhancing the consolidation of newly acquired semantic knowledge. Although postencoding theta oscillatory power increase has been reported to benefit episodic memory consolidation, its influence on semantic memory retention has not been examined. In this experiment, 175 participants were taught fundamental immunology concepts and were then randomly assigned to receive either theta or beta tACS, applied through midline frontal, left parietal, or bilateral parietal montages, or sham stimulation as a passive control condition. Memory for that newly acquired knowledge was assessed before and shortly after the intervention, 24 hr later, and 1 week later, to evaluate both acute and longer-lasting effects of the stimulation. Results indicated that theta tACS significantly enhanced memory consolidation compared with both sham and beta conditions, especially when applied using a parietal montage targeting the area of the left angular gyrus. The resulting improved performance was consistent across all stages of assessment, indicating a robust effect of postencoding theta stimulation on the persistence of semantic memory. This suggests that some processes and substrates of early memory consolidation are common to episodic and semantic memories. These findings hold practical implications for educational and therapeutic contexts, suggesting that theta tACS might be used to reinforce learning, in both healthy and memory-challenged individuals.",

    "content": "The current study investigates whether changes in scalp electroencephalographic activity over time reflect the effects of target detection and divided attention on memory encoding. We recorded electroencephalographic activity in 61 young adults as they memorized lists of words either under full attention (single-task) or while performing a secondary task (dual task). In both cases, colored squares appeared with each word. However, in the dual-task condition, participants also pressed a button when the colored squares were in a predefined color (target) but made no response when the squares were in a different color (distractor). Subsequent memory effects in the alpha (8\u201312 Hz) and high gamma (50\u2013100 Hz) frequency bands changed throughout the trial, and these effects differed across conditions. Before word presentation, high gamma activity was associated with encoding success in the target and single-task conditions, but not in the distractor conditions. In contrast, alpha band activity decreased following word presentation, and these decreases were greater for successfully encoded words in the target condition than in the distractor or single-task conditions. The results are consistent with the view that alpha and gamma activity reflect distinct neural processes, which both contribute to memory formation, but are differentially sensitive to task demands and momentary shifts in attention.",

    "title": "The Impact of Auditory Distraction on Visual Memory Encoding in Middle-aged and Older Adults: A High-density Electroencephalography Study",
    "content": "Multitasking is essential for facing the complexity of everyday life environments, where the simultaneous processing of multiple information streams is ubiquitous, and it often requires an increased deployment of attentional resources to manage concurrent tasks. The physiological cognitive decline associated with aging further depletes cognitive resources, making it important to investigate the impact of aging on multitasking abilities, particularly in relation to the mnestic domain. To this aim, we investigated the impact of auditory distraction on visual memory encoding in older adults using high-density electroencephalography. Fifty healthy adults aged 48\u201372 yearscompleted a dual-task paradigm, combining visual memory encoding with an auditory sustained attention task. Behavioral performance was analyzed alongside neural correlates measured through ERPs and theta synchronization during high-density electroencephalography recordings. Participants demonstrated a decline in visual memory recognition performance under the more demanding dual-task condition, but with a stable cost across age. Increasing age negatively impacted overall performance but also subjective confidence. Neurophysiological data showed larger subsequent memory effect amplitudes and increased theta synchronization during dual-tasking, suggesting greater item-specific encoding. Source localization identified the left orbitofrontal and superior temporal gyri as well as the right opercular gyrus as key regions involved in memory encoding under distraction. Increased theta power at rest correlated with worse task performance in older adults, suggesting that neural processing efficiency declines with age. These findings highlight how multitasking interferes with memory encoding in adults, with significant neural recruitment to compensate for dual-task demands.",

    "title": "Misprediction Sensitivity Is Diminished for Action-effects Resulting from Stimulus-driven Movement",
    "content": "While volitional movement is thought to be initiated based on its anticipated capacity to achieve sensory goals, stimulus-driven movement may be generated with less regard for its specific effects. Sensorimotor processes that make use of action-effect predictions may therefore differ between these forms of movement, including sensory attenuation and the detection of mispredicted motor effects. In this study, we explored sensory attenuation by comparing the evoked response of externally-generated tones with those produced by participants (n = 61), both according to their own timing (i.e., volitionally) and in response to simple visual cues (i.e., stimulus-driven). The influence of stimulus identity prediction (i.e., the predictability of tone frequency) on N1 amplitudes was not found to differ between self- and externally-generated stimuli, or on the basis of volitional control. Reduced P2 amplitudes were observed in response to self-generated tones, which may suggest that these were subject to higher levels of attentional control, including processes involved in the termination of attention. To explore misprediction sensitivity, we compared the influence of stimulus identity prediction on N2b component amplitudes. A significant interaction was found to reflect heightened sensitivity to mispredicted outcomes of volitional action, compared with those of stimulus-driven movement. In light of recent evidence that attentional suppression may attenuate the primary cortical response to outcomes of stimulus-driven movement, we propose that this mechanism might also serve to diminish misprediction sensitivity. As such, these effects may represent important features of sensorimotor processing that assist in differentiating stimuli on the basis of self-generation and intentionality.",

    "title": "High-frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Can Improve Attentional Control Under Stress: Behavioral and Electrophysiological Evidence",
    "content": "Psychological stress impairs cognition, forcing attention toward stressor-related information. However, stress may reallocate limited cognitive resources in adaptive ways. How stress modulates the attentional control remains unclear. In this study, the stress-related changes in both target processing and distractor interference were investigated in Experiment 1, where an additional singleton task was employed with a stress group and a control group. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with both stress responses and attentional control. The role of the left DLPFC in regulating attention control under stress was investigated using repetitive TMS in Experiment 2, which included control-vertex, stress-vertex, and stress-DLPFC groups. Electroencephalography was recorded. The results showed that (1) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited increased RT attentional capture effect and greater distractor-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, indicating increased distractor interference under stress; (2) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited a greater target-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, suggesting enhanced target processing under stress; and (3) compared with the stress-vertex group, the stress-DLPFC group exhibited greater target-elicited N2pc effect, but a similar distractor-elicited N2pc effect, suggesting that left-DLPFC stimulation improved target processing but exerted no influence on distractor processing. In addition, faster RTs, along with a reduced RT attentional capture effect, were found for the stress-DLPFC group, implying that the target processing following left-DLPFC stimulation might be less affected by the distractor due to the heightened target processing. The left DLPFC may play a crucial role in modulating attentional control under stress.",

    "title": "A Role of Pupil-linked Arousal, Cingulo-insular Cortex, and Intralaminar Thalamus for Auditory Near-threshold Perception",
    "content": "The perception of near-threshold tones varies strongly across trials, likely because of fluctuations in sustained attention or arousal. We used parallel fMRI and pupillometry to study the role of attention networks for the detection of near-threshold tones in three phases: (1) passive listening, (2) active detection of salient tones, and (3) active detection of near-threshold tones. Results confirmed previous findings from magnetoencephalography that auditory cortex activity and pupil-dilation responses for near-threshold tones were only observed when task-relevant, stronger for hit trials, but also present for miss trials. We then sought which attention-related areas show a similar response pattern, and found it in insular cortex, anterior midcingulate cortex, and inferior precentral sulcus. Moreover, activity in the insula was already stronger for hit than miss trials in the prestimulus interval. Activity for hit trials was also observed in a number of subcortical nuclei, including thalamus, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, and the colliculi. Like insula, activity in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus additionally showed activity for miss trials and stronger activity for hit trials in the baseline. Finally, BOLD activity correlated to spontaneous pupil fluctuations was evaluated and revealed biphasic activation and deactivation in a widespread cortical network, with a maximum 3 sec and minimum 7 sec after pupil dilation. The cortical networks included insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, retro-splenial, and sensory cortex. Overall, these data identify the cingulo-insular network and the intralaminar thalamic nuclei as potential sources of fluctuations in auditory cortex activity in the context of near-threshold tone detection.",

However, the high complexity of fMRI signals makes brain functional representations intractable. Here, we introduce a state decomposition method to reduce this complexity and decipher individual brain functions at multiple levels. Briefly, brain dynamics are captured by temporal first-order derivatives and spatially divided into 'state sets' at each time point based on the...",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello! A software-based interactive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system#Feedback_control_systems\">control system</a> is something I've wanted to make for a long time, but with animation/GUIs being so fiddly in Python, I lacked the motivation to actually put it together. But thanks to a little vibe coding from Claude and DeepSeek (ChatGPT really doesn't like controls apparently!), I was able to push through and make this.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>The interface implements your choice of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller\">PID controller</a> or H2 optimal controller. For the unfamiliar, the goal of a control system is to manipulate the inputs of a dynamical systems in such a way to guide the output towards what we want it to be, in spite of random disturbances perturbing our system.</p> <p>The system dynamic model is:</p> <pre><code>x_1' = -(k_12 + d) * x_1 + k_21 * x_2 + u x_2' = k_12 * x_1 - (k_21 + d) * x_2 + w_1 y = x_2 + w_2 </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Control systems are used in engineering, so anyone who has studied (mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc) engineering may get some use out of this. It's supposed to be educational as well as just mildly interesting, so I've put explainers for what the variables represent and what the controllers actually do in the comments of the code.</p> <p>Feel free to play around with it, you can see just how much better the H2 controller handles noise than the PID controller, that is what it is designed to do after all. It works so well that I thought at first the controller was 'cheating' and accessing the noise-free state variables, but it isn't!</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>There aren't too many projects like this, usually controllers are implemented in hardware rather than software so you don't get to see them raw!</p> <p><strong>Code:</strong> <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/lorcan2440/2de2397793311f484a4c47cc21183347\">here</a><br /> <strong>Video of the program running:</strong> on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlTheory/comments/1nc1q4q/interactive_pid_and_h2_optimal_controller_python/\">this post</a><br /> <strong>Python libraries to install:</strong> NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, PyQt6<br /> <code>$ pip install numpy scipy matplotlib PyQt6</code><br /> Tested only on Windows, Python 3.11.<br /> Questions/feedback/bug reports welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gitgud_x\"> /u/gitgud_x </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nc1xel/interactive_pid_and_h2_optimal_controller/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nc1xel/interactive_pid_and_h2_optimal_controller/\">[comments]</a></span>",

A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",

However, the brain is extensively interconnected, and the neurons comprising those connections may themselves be particularly susceptible to neurostimulation. Here, we test this hypothesis by identifying long-range projections in single-unit recordings from nonhuman primates receiving transcranial alternating...",

    "content": "<p>Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>",

Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>",

    "title": "Potentiation of Nigra-Striatal Dopaminergic Projection Underpins Core Autism-Like Behaviors in Valproate-Exposed Mice",
    "content": "<p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the underlying neural circuit dysfunction that accounts for these coexisting symptoms in autism remains poorly understood. Here we revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced functional alterations of dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Specifically, we observed enhanced excitatory input and increased excitability in SNc-&gt;DMS dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in a basal state of potentiation. This potentiated baseline activity blunted the phasic responses of SNc-&gt;DMS projections, as evidenced by reduction of transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DA signaling during social interaction and expression of repetitive behaviors in valproate-exposed male mice. We then utilized chronic chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to selectively manipulate the abnormal basal activity of SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling. This targeted intervention successfully rectified the dysfunction in D1R-expressed medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) associated with social deficits, while simultaneously restoring the functionality of D2-MSNs linked to repetitive behaviors. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that prenatal valproate exposure disrupts SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling, which mediates the coexistence of two core autism-like behaviors by reshaping the dynamics of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moreover, these results highlight potential therapeutic targets for developing interventions for both core symptoms of autism.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Cerebellum (CB) interactions with forebrain systems contribute to learning cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and CB. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and CB are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning CS&ndash;US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. Here, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS&ndash;US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS&ndash;US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, during both stimuli and the intertrial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired trials, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of either sex to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3,078 tested CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch-clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch-clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human&rsquo;s visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the  foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea in 12 human observers (both sexes). Although the tested foveolar locations were only  away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, the asymmetry is reversed: stimuli presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~ away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.</p>",

    "title": "Relationship between sleep duration and hearing loss among adults aged 20\u201369: exploration of the U\u2013shaped curve pattern",
    "content": "ObjectiveThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data were used to explore the relationship between sleep duration and hearing level among adults aged 20 to 69 years, aiming to verify the association between abnormal sleep duration and hearing loss (HL).Study designCross-sectional prevalence study.SettingThe study utilized data from the NHANES, a large-scale, population-based, cross-sectional survey conducted in the United States. The NHANES is carried out by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to assess the health and nutritional status of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population.MethodsThis study was based on the NHANES data from 2015 to 2016 and 2017 to 2020. A complex multistage probability sampling method was used to select adults aged 20\u201369 years. After excluding individuals with missing data, 4,883 participants were finally included. Sleep duration was collected through questionnaires, and hearing measurements were conducted by professional staff in mobile examination centers, including PTA at low frequencies, speech frequencies, and high frequencies. Statistical analysis was performed using a weighted linear regression model, adjusting for confounding factors such as gender and age. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) method was used to explore the non-linear relationship between sleep duration and hearing threshold. All statistical analyses were completed in the R environment, and p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsThere was a U\u2013shaped curve relationship between sleep duration and hearing threshold (p-overall trend < 0.001, p-non-linearity < 0.001), with the critical turning point at 8 h of sleep. Before this turning point, increasing sleep duration had a protective effect on the hearing threshold; after the turning point, excessive sleep duration led to an increase in the hearing threshold. After stratification by gender and age, a U\u2013shaped curve relationship between sleep duration and hearing threshold was still observed in men and the elderly (p-overall trend < 0.001, p-non-linearity < 0.001). However, no dose\u2013response relationship between sleep duration and hearing threshold was observed in women, young adults, and middle-aged adults (p-overall trend = 0.295, p-non-linearity = 0.158; p-overall trend = 0.447, p-non-linearity = 0.315; p-overall trend = 0.156, p-non-linearity = 0.777).ConclusionThere is a U\u2013shaped curve relationship between sleep duration and hearing threshold, with the turning point at 8 h. Both short and long sleep durations have an adverse effect on hearing, and this phenomenon is particularly significant in men and the elderly. Future research needs to increase the sample size and adopt a prospective longitudinal study design. Meanwhile, Mendelian randomization and basic experimental studies can help to explore the underlying mechanisms in depth. Developing corresponding preventive strategies may help to reduce the potential burden of HL.",

    "title": "Craniometric guidance for the Sylvian vein",
    "content": "ObjectivesThe Sylvian vein (SV) is the primary anatomical landmark on the lateral surface of the brain. For the neurosurgical approach, recognizing the SV is essential information. With the trend toward minimally invasive surgery, precise anatomical localization becomes increasingly important. Moreover, a craniometric guidance for the SV will reliably enhance neurosurgical planning and intraoperative approach. Anatomical guidance for the SV was previously proposed, and it utilized a linear bar type. However, its representation was complex and unclear. Thus, we aimed to develop a new guidance for the SV.Materials and methodsThe SV of thirty-seven patients was illustrated on venous phase angiographic images. Scanned images were manually fused using Adobe Photoshop CS5. The outlines of the lateral skulls were realigned to fit together, after which venous structures were overlaid. Coronal sutures and posterior clinoid processes served as references during this realignment process. Half the length of the line connecting the external ear canal (EAC) and glabella was used to draw a circle (Sylvian circle). The Sylvian circle (SC) and the actual course of the SVs were then compared. The SV and SC distributions were measured using ImageJ (NIH).ResultsTwenty-nine (79%) of the thirty-seven patients exhibited SV located within 5\u202fmm of the SC. Five SVs were positioned above the SC, and two were placed below it. There was a total of seven cases in which the trajectory was within 5\u202fmm of the SC and accounted for less than 80% of the path.ConclusionThe SC represents the contour of the SV more accurately than a straight line. The SC can be drawn promptly and is instinctively applicable in pre- and intra-operative neurosurgical practice.",

    "title": "Assessment of dynamic stability and identification of key tasks and parameters in patients with unilateral and bilateral vestibulopathy: a laboratory-based study",
    "content": "Chronic imbalance is the cardinal symptom in bilateral vestibulopathy patients (BV), and in a subset of symptomatic unilateral vestibulopathy patients (UV), leading to a significant impact on their daily lives. Despite these profound effects, such as the risk of falls, the mechanism of imbalance remains complex, posing challenges both for monitoring patients\u2019 functional status and for evaluating rehabilitation therapies. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamic stability of patients with BV and UV during multiple motor tasks and to provide a summary of the most relevant tasks and biomechanical parameters. The purpose was to propose a \u201cshort-form FGA\u201d (Functional Gait Assessment) test to reduce the length and complexity of tests, to be able to evaluate future therapies longitudinally, and to monitor functional follow-up of patients. Dynamic stability, spatio-temporal and kinematic parameters were calculated for 10 BV patients, 10 UV patients and 10 asymptomatic controls while walking at three self-selected walking speeds, while performing dual tasks and while completing the 10 tasks of the FGA battery. Two (validity and interpretability) of the four COSMIN domains and clinical applicability were evaluated to identify relevant tasks and parameters to the study population, i.e., good discriminant and convergent validity, and good clinical applicability. The comfortable and slow gait, as well as the turn pivot, eyes closed, and tandem walk tasks were identified as the most relevant for characterizing dynamic stability in these patients. Easily interpretable and visually assessable parameters, such as walking speed, center of mass displacement, step width, trunk movement, stiffness of the head/trunk, and number of steps, were identified as the most relevant. In contrast, stability parameters such as margin of stability or whole body angular momentum did not prove to be effective parameters. These relevant parameters should enable future studies to evaluate rehabilitation therapies such as vestibular implants or physiotherapy, as well as to monitor patients\u2019 functional status. Future studies should validate these results and assess the missing psychometric properties of these parameters.",

    "content": "Functional connectivity (FC) quantifies the temporal coherence of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across brain regions. Recently, the information-theoretic \"complexome\" framework has linked FC to coinciding 'complexity drops': transient moments in which regional BOLD signals simultaneously become regular. Here, we replicate this relationship in an independent dataset and extend the framework by (i) integrating it with signal cofluctuation analysis through edge-timeseries, (ii) extending the previous binary concept of simultaneous complexity drops to a continuous, threshold-free calculation, (iii) providing evidence of clinical relevance in the model disease of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis, and (iv) deriving a novel measure of pairwise dissimilarity in local BOLD patterns. This 'index of pattern incongruency' (IPI) explains clinically relevant FC reductions and maps onto novel associations with cognition. These findings show that global FC is closely related to local patterns within underlying BOLD signals, strengthening the link between complexity dynamics and the brain's functional organization as a large-scale network.",

    "title": "A neuronal imaging dataset for deep learning in the reconstruction of single-neuron axons",
    "content": "Neuron reconstruction is a critical step in quantifying neuronal structures from imaging data. Advances in molecular labeling techniques and optical imaging technologies have spurred extensive research into the patterns of long-range neuronal projections. However, mapping these projections incurs significant costs, as large-scale reconstruction of individual axonal arbors remains time-consuming. In this study, we present a dataset comprising axon imaging volumes along with corresponding annotations to facilitate the evaluation and development of axon reconstruction algorithms. This dataset, derived from 11 mouse brain samples imaged using fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography, contains carefully selected 852 volume images sized at 192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192 voxels. These images exhibit substantial variations in terms of axon density, image intensity, and signal-to-noise ratios, even within localized regions. Conventional methods often struggle when processing such complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a distance field-supervised segmentation network designed to enhance image signals effectively. Our results demonstrate significantly improved axon detection rates across both state-of-the-art and traditional methodologies. The released dataset and benchmark algorithm provide a data foundation for advancing novel axon reconstruction methods and are valuable for accelerating the reconstruction of long-range axonal projections.",

    "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
    "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

    "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "Diaphragm dysfunction represents a significant complication in elderly patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, often resulting in extended intensive care stays, unsuccessful weaning attempts, and increased healthcare expenditures. To address the deficiency of precise, real-time decision support in this context, a novel artificial intelligence framework is proposed, integrating imaging, physiological signals, and ventilator parameters. Initially, a hierarchical Transformer encoder is employed to extract modality-specific embeddings, followed by an attention-guided cross-modal fusion module and a temporal network for dynamic trend prediction. The framework was assessed using three public datasets, which are, the MIMIC-IV, eICU, and Chest X-ray. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy (92.3% on MIMIC-IV, 91.8% on eICU, 92.0% on Chest X-ray) and surpassed all baselines in precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, the model's probability estimates were well-calibrated, and its SHAP-based explainability analysis identified ventilator volume and key imaging features as primary predictors. The clinical implications of this study are significant. By providing precise and interpretable predictions, the proposed model has the potential to transform critical care practices by offering a pathway to more effective and personalized interventions for high-risk patients.",

    "content": "As global life expectancy rises, a growing proportion of the population is affected by dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Electroencephalography (EEG) based diagnosis presents a non-invasive, cost effective alternative for early detection, yet existing methods are challenged by data scarcity, inter-subject variability, and privacy concerns. This study proposes lightweight and privacy-preserving EEG classification framework combining deep learning and Federated Learning (FL). Five convolutional neural networks (EEGNetv1, EEGNetv4, EEGITNet, EEGInception, EEGInceptionERP) have been evaluated on resting-state EEG dataset comprising 88 subjects. EEG signals are preprocessed using band-pass (1\u201345 Hz) and notch filtering, followed by exponential standardization and 4-second windowing. EEGNetv4 outperformed among other EEG tailored models, and upon utilizing the hybrid fusion techniques it achieves 97.1% accuracy using only 1,609 parameters and less than 1 MB of memory, demonstrating high efficiency. Moreover, FL using FedAvg is implemented across five stratified clients, achieving 96.9% accuracy on the hybrid fused EEGNetV4 model while preserving data privacy. This work establishes a scalable, resource-efficient, and privacy-compliant framework for EEG-based dementia diagnosis, suitable for deployment in real-world clinical and edge-device settings.",

    "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "title": "Identifying robust neural signatures of acupuncture modulation in healthy brains: a multimodal meta-analysis mapping core network",
    "content": "Acupuncture, a cornerstone of Chinese integrative medicine, demonstrates clinical efficacy for pain- and inflammation-related conditions through extensive clinical practices. Using multimodal neuroimaging techniques (fMRI and PET), numerous studies have investigated acupuncture\u2019s impact on brain structure and function. However, a systematic integration of these findings is still lacking. To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach to identify brain regions that consistently modulated by verum acupuncture in both healthy populations and patients. Critically, establishing neural signatures in healthy populations provides a foundational baseline for normative brain responses, which is essential to detect pathological deviations in patient cohorts. Subsequent behavioral domain analyses elucidated the functional profiles of these significant clusters. To characterize whole brain functional connectivity architecture that associated with identified regions, we employed meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses. Our analyses consistently implicated the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (extending into postcentral gyrus) and right thalamus, key regions within the somatosensory pain processing network, as core neural substrates that modulated by acupuncture in healthy populations. Functional connectivity analyses further demonstrated that these brain clusters engaged a distributed pain-processing network, including bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and insular cortex. Taken together, these findings provide a mechanistic neurobiological basis for acupuncture-induced pain processing and identify potential therapeutic targets within the pain-associated neural circuitry.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024562566, identifier CRD42024562566.",

    "title": "Exploring neurodevelopment through oscillatory and aperiodic EEG activity: methodological and clinical consideration",
    "content": "Understanding the neural dynamics that characterize early brain development is a central goal in neuroscience. Electroencephalography (EEG), is particularly well suited for studying the developing brain, given to its non-invasive nature and high temporal resolution. Spectral analysis of EEG signals reveals two key components: oscillatory activity associated with cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and perception; and aperiodic activity that reflects scale-free neural processes. While traditionally neglected, the aperiodic component has recently emerged as a crucial feature in understanding both typical and atypical brain functioning. This narrative review provides an overview of the most recent evidence regarding these EEG spectral features with a focus on their developmental trajectories and clinical significance. The review is structured into three main sections: (i) methodological considerations for analyzing oscillatory and aperiodic components of EEG spectrum; (ii) developmental changes in EEG spectral features during early childhood; (iii) alterations in spectral activity in children with developmental disorders. By highlighting recent findings and identifying gaps in the literature, this review aims to advance our understanding of how spectral EEG analysis can inform both basic and clinical neuroscience in early development. We emphasize the importance of considering both oscillatory and aperiodic components as a complementary feature of the spectral characteristic of the EEG signal contributing specifically to the characterization of brain functioning. In sum, this review offers updated and comprehensive support for researchers and clinicians working in developmental neuroscience serving both as a starting point for new studies and a bridge toward more effective EEG-based clinical tools.",

    "title": "Inhibition of autophagy-lysosomal function exacerbates microglial and monocyte lipid metabolism reprograming and dysfunction after brain injury",
    "content": "CNS has an overall higher level of lipids than all tissues except adipose and contains up to 25% of total body cholesterol. Recent data demonstrate a complex crosstalk between lipid metabolism and inflammation, suggesting potential contribution of the lipid-rich brain environment to neuroinflammation. While recent data support the importance of brain lipid environment to inflammatory changes observed in age related chronic neurodegenerative diseases, in vivo interactions between lipid environment, lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation in acute brain disease and injury remain poorly understood. Here we utilize a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to demonstrate that acute neurotrauma leads to widespread lipid metabolism reprograming in all microglial and brain associated and infiltrating monocyte populations. Additionally, we identify unique microglial and monocyte populations with higher degree of lipid metabolism reprograming and pronounced accumulation of neutral storage lipids, including cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. These lipids accumulate not only in lipid droplets but also in the microglial and monocyte lysosomes and are associated with lysosomal dysfunction and inhibition of autophagy after TBI. Our data indicate that lipid accumulation in these cells is the result of altered lipid handling rather than lipid synthesis and is triggered by phagocytosis of lipid-rich myelin debris generated after TBI. Finally, we use mice with autophagy defects in microglia and monocytes to demonstrate that further inhibition of autophagy leads to more pronounced lipid metabolism reprograming and exacerbated cellular lipid accumulation. Our data suggest a pathological feedback loop, where lipid phagocytosis causes inhibition of autophagy-lysosomal function, which in turn exacerbates cellular lipid retention, reprograming and inflammation.",

    "title": "REST/NRSF phosphorylation by CaMKIV regulates its transcriptional repressor activity and half-life",
    "content": "REST is a repressor of a large cluster of neural genes containing RE1 motifs. In neurons, REST homeostatically regulates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, However, whether REST can be regulated by Ca2+ and Ca2+-activated kinases is unknown. Here, we investigated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) as upstream regulators of REST fate and activity. We show that REST is phosphorylated by CaMKIV at a main Ser-322 site located within the linker between the 5th and the 6th N-terminal Zn-finger domains. Phosphomimic REST mutant in Serine-322 decreased REST repressor activity and caused its transition from nucleus to cytosol, followed by degradation. Molecular dynamics simulations of the phosphomimic N-terminal REST and the DNA RE1 sequence revealed a sharp decrease in the stability of the REST-RE1 binding interface. Moreover, the homeostatic effects of CaMKIV on the amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents were inhibited by the genetic deletion of REST. The results demonstrate that REST phosphorylation by CaMKIV regulates the repressor activity of REST on neural genes and has a crucial role in the homeostatic regulation of REST levels.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "content": "BackgroundThis study presents a novel paradigm termed Contrasting Routines Affecting Bereitschaftspotential (C.R.A.B.), designed to analyze readiness potential (RP) waveforms preceding movements across varying experimental settings. This paradigm continues Libet's work on decision-making, with an emphasis on the motor planning component like in classical Libet experiment. However, existing paradigms for studying RP work poorly across ages (requiring different instructions) and do not accurately identify the components associated with RP formation.New methodThe C.R.A.B. paradigm enables modeling the when-decision through indirect measurements, thereby avoiding reliance on participants' introspective reports. We believe that this framework can isolate the motor planning component from decision-making and is also suitable for implementation with children of different ages and disorders.ResultsAs a proof of concept, we employed the C.R.A.B. paradigm with healthy adult participants to validate its effectiveness. Our findings revealed distinct RP waveform variations across different trial conditions. Comparison with existing methods C.R.A.B. paradigm has several advantages over traditional methods: the design of the experiment provides for the assessment of different components of RP\u2014motor planning, attention level, and spontaneity of decision-making since the design of the experiment is developed in a game form, it is suitable for both children and adults.ConclusionsThe C.R.A.B. paradigm effectively demonstrated differences in RP waveforms across trial types; therefore, this paradigm can be used to study the various components of the RP in detail. Since this paradigm represents a game interface, it is possible to study the RP in children, including children with various disorders.",

    "content": "IntroductionMotion sickness often causes passengers to experience negative emotions such as tension, which in turn triggers symptoms like dizziness and nausea, seriously affecting the travel experience of passengers. Previous studies have shown that music can alleviate negative emotions such as tension, but its effect on motion sickness remains unclear, and the differences in the alleviation effect of different types of music on motion sickness need to be quantitatively evaluated.MethodsWe collected Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 30 subjects in a simulated driving environment and constructed a motion sickness recognition model by combining time-and frequency-domain features (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, power spectral density) with classification algorithms. The model achieved accurate identification of passenger motion sickness states. Based on this model, the intervention effects of four types of music (joyful, sad, stirring, and soft) on motion sickness were further evaluated and compared with the control group (taking natural recovery measures).ResultsThe results showed that soft and joyful music had better intervention effects (average reduction of 56.7 and 57.3%, respectively), followed by passionate and sad music (average reduction of 48.3 and 40%, respectively), among which the alleviation effect of sad music was lower than that of the control group (average reduction of 43.3%). In addition, it was verified that the EEG Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity in the occipital region was significantly negatively correlated with the motion sickness grade p = \u22120.625, p < 0.005).DiscussionThe study suggests that personalized music intervention strategies may effectively alleviate motion sickness symptoms of passengers, thereby increasing cabin comfort and improving the travel experience of passengers.",

    "title": "The slowest timescales of neural synchronization reveal the strongest influence of auditory distraction",
    "content": "IntroductionAmong all the sounds occurring at any given time, people are often interested in listening to just one. Some competing sounds are merely background noise, whereas others distract attention from target sounds and are less easily suppressed. During active listening, the central auditory pathway unmixes target and distractor sounds based on temporal differences across three orders of magnitude \u2013 from millisecond differences in acoustic temporal fine structure to slower perceptual grouping factors that stretch out to multiple seconds. We developed an approach to directly measure central auditory encoding of multiplexed target and distractor sound features in human listeners to determine which timescales are most impacted by the presence of distracting sounds.MethodsTarget sounds contained nested features along four timescales, including temporal fine structure (~500 Hz), temporal envelope (~25\u201380 Hz), envelope changes (~7 Hz), and slower changes reflecting whether target stimuli were randomly arranged or formed a repeating pattern (~0.5 Hz). Targets were presented with competing sounds that provided variable distraction levels: either a highly distracting melody or a less distracting noise. Neural synchronization to each timescale was simultaneously measured for target and distractor sounds from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during a listening task.ResultsSustained shifts from random to regular sequence arrangements were reliably perceived, yet did not evoke a pattern recognition potential, nor neural synchronization changes at any timescale. Synchronization to relatively slow changes in envelope transitions of the target sound deteriorated with the addition of more distracting sounds while synchronization to more rapid fluctuations in the fine structure or envelope were unaffected by varying distraction level. Categorizing trials by task performance revealed a conjunction of enhanced entrainment to slower temporal features in the distractor sound and reduced synchronization to the target sound on error trials.DiscussionBy designing a stimulus paradigm that leveraged the temporal processing capabilities of the auditory nervous system, we were able to simultaneously quantify multiple target and distractor sound features reproduced in the EEG. This paradigm identified synchronization processes which may prove valuable for research on clinical populations who report difficulty suppressing awareness of distracting sounds.",

    "content": "PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on cognitive flexibility under different levels of task complexity. The hypothesis was that taVNS would enhance cognitive flexibility more effectively under demanding task conditions.MethodA within-subject design was used, involving 24 healthy adults who completed a Dimensional Change Card Sorting task combined with an auditory task of varying difficulty levels (low, medium, high). Participants underwent both active and sham taVNS conditions while performing the tasks. The complexity of the auditory task served to reduce cognitive resources available for the cognitive flexibility task, allowing an assessment of how taVNS modulates cognitive flexibility under different task difficulty conditions.ResultsThe results show that switch costs in the Dimensional Change Card Sorting task increase with task difficulty. In addition, active taVNS reduced switch costs significantly in the high complexity condition, while no differences were observed in the low and medium complexity conditions. This indicates that taVNS is particularly effective in conditions of higher cognitive demand.ConclusionThe findings suggest that taVNS enhances cognitive flexibility, especially in more complex tasks, providing a better understanding of the effects of taVNS on cognitive control.",

    "content": "The Japanese language has a unique writing system that consists of kanji (morphograms, derived from Chinese characters) and kana (phonograms, a simplified form of kanji representing syllables). A kanji character has two distinct ways of reading: on-reading (Chinese-style pronunciation) and kun-reading (native Japanese pronunciation). Some kanji words have irregular kun-reading called jukujikun. Furthermore, kana characters have two script forms: hiragana (cursive form) and katakana (square form), each of which is used for different purposes. Because of these features, Japanese individuals with alexia and agraphia show characteristic symptoms. Lesion-to-symptom analyses and functional imaging studies developed beginning in the 1970s have reported the following findings: (1) kanji\u2013kana dissociation in alexia/agraphia: pure alexia for kanji or kana, lexical agraphia for kanji, and phonological agraphia for kana; (2) on-kun dissociation in alexia: predominant kun-reading and jukujikun reading impairment in semantic dementia and selective on-reading impairment in the extensive posterior middle temporal gyrus lesion; and (3) allographic agraphia between hiragana and katakana.",

    "title": "Predicting attachment style from EEG data on the Flanker task",
    "content": "Bowlby's attachment theory describes the differences that people exhibit in the way they form emotional bonds with others. The dimensional measure of attachment describes it by the magnitude of anxiety and an avoidance dimension, which are currently measured using a self-report questionnaire. Recent advances in neurophysiological methods have started exploring the neural underpinnings of attachment styles. Nonetheless, a conspicuous gap remains: the underexplored realm of predictive models for predicting attachment styles based on objective physiological data. With that in mind, we have constructed a model for inferring individual attachment profiles, based solely on their brain signals recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG). For that aim, we recorded EEG data of 27 participants engaged in the Flanker task and receiving either positive or negative feedback following each trial. We then utilized the recently developed ROCKET algorithm (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) to automatically extract 20,000 time-series features from the EEG data. Next, we applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reduced the number of features to 87 individual components that were used to construct regression models predicting participants' anxiety and avoidance scores, as measured by the ECR-R questionnaire. Our results show, for the first time, that individual attachment profiles can be inferred from EEG data, allowing post hoc categorization into the four canonical attachment styles. This offers two key contributions: first, it provides an objective alternative to traditional self-report questionnaires, helping reduce subjectivity bias in attachment assessment. Second, it highlights the value of using automatically generated features over the limited set of hand-crafted features typically found in the literature.",

In this paper, a further study is shown by proposing a novel combined discrete-time ZNN (CDTZNN) model for solving TVNE. Specifically, a new difference formula, which is called the Taylor difference formula, is constructed for first-order derivative approximation by following Taylor series expansion. The Taylor difference formula is then used to discretize the continuous-time ZNN model in the previous study. The corresponding DTZNN model is obtained, where the direct Jacobian matrix inversion is required (being time consuming). Another DTZNN model for computing the inverse of Jacobian matrix is established to solve the aforementioned limitation. The novel CDTZNN model for solving the TVNE is thus developed by combining the two models. Theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed CDTZNN model. The CDTZNN applicability is further indicated by applying the proposed model to the motion planning of robot manipulators.",

However, a major challenge lies in enhancing the system's ability to generalize, personalize, and adapt to the high variability of EMG signals. Artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks, has shown promising decoding performance when applied to large datasets. However, highly parameterized deep neural networks usually require extensive user-specific data with ground truth labels to learn individual unique EMG patterns. However, the characteristics of the EMG signal can change significantly over time, even for the same user, leading to performance degradation during extended use. In this work, we propose an innovative three-stage neural network training scheme designed to progressively develop an adaptive workflow, improving and maintaining the network performance on 28 subjects over 2 days.

    "content": "In deep-sea areas, the hoisting operation of offshore wind turbines is seriously affected by waves, and the secondary impact is prone to occur between the turbine and the pile foundation. To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated wave compensation system for offshore wind turbines based on a neuromorphic vision (NeuroVI) camera. The system employs a NeuroVI camera to achieve non-contact, high-precision, and low-latency displacement detection of hydraulic cylinders, overcoming the limitations of traditional magnetostrictive displacement sensors, which exhibit slow response and susceptibility to interference in harsh marine conditions. A dynamic simulation model was developed using AMESim-Simulink co-simulation to analyze the compensation performance of the NeuroVI-based system under step and sinusoidal wave disturbances. Comparative results demonstrate that the NeuroVI feedback system achieves faster response times and superior stability over conventional sensors. Laboratory-scale model tests and real-world application in the installation of a 5.2\u202fMW offshore wind turbine validated the system\u2019s feasibility and robustness, enabling real-time collaborative control of turbine and cylinder displacement to effectively mitigate multi-impact risks. This research provides an innovative approach for deploying neural perception technology in complex marine scenarios and advances the development of neuro-robotic systems in ocean engineering.",

However, analyzing UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep learning\u2013driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV platforms.MethodThe framework suggests using today\u2019s best neural networks that are made to solve different problems in aerial vehicle analysis. RetinexNet is used in preprocessing to make the lighting of each input frame consistent. Using HRNet for semantic segmentation allows for accurate splitting between vehicles and their surroundings. YOLOv11 provides high precision and quick vehicle detection and Deep SORT allows reliable tracking without losing track of individual cars. CSRNet are used for vehicle counting that is unaffected by obstacles or traffic jams. LSTM models capture how a car moves in time to forecast future positions. Combining DenseNet and SuperPoint embeddings that were improved with an AutoEncoder is done during feature extraction. In the end, using an attention function, Vision Transformer-based models classify vehicles seen from above. Every part of the system is developed and included to give the improved performance when the UAV is being used in real life.ResultsOur proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of vehicle analysis from UAV imagery. Our pipeline was rigorously evaluated on two famous datasets, AU-AIR and Roundabout. On the AU-AIR dataset, the system achieved a detection accuracy of 97.8%, a tracking accuracy of 96.5%, and a classification accuracy of 98.4%. Similarly, on the Roundabout dataset, it reached 96.9% detection accuracy, 94.4% tracking accuracy, and 97.7% classification accuracy. These results surpass previous benchmarks, demonstrating the system\u2019s robust performance across diverse aerial traffic scenarios. The integration of advanced models, YOLOv11 for detection, HRNet for segmentation, Deep SORT for tracking, CSRNet for counting, LSTM for trajectory prediction, and Vision Transformers for classification enables the framework to maintain high accuracy even under challenging conditions like occlusion, variable lighting, and scale variations.DiscussionThe outcomes show that the chosen deep learning system is powerful enough to deal with the challenges of aerial vehicle analysis and gives reliable and precise results in all the aforementioned tasks. Combining several advanced models ensures that the system works smoothly even when dealing with problems like people being covered up and varying sizes.",

    "title": "Fine-grained image classification using the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism",
    "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

The Residual Convolutional Block Attention Module (RCBAM) serves as the teacher network to extract high-dimensional spatial features via residual structures and channel\u2013spatial attention. The student network adopts a Temporal Convolutional Network\u2013LSTM (TCN\u2013LSTM) design, integrating dilated causal convolutions and two LSTM layers for efficient temporal modeling. Historical ADS-B trajectory data from Zhuhai Jinwan Airport are preprocessed using cubic spline interpolation and a uniform-step sliding window to ensure data alignment and temporal consistency. In the distillation process, soft labels from the teacher and hard labels from actual observations jointly guide student trainingResultsIn multi-step prediction experiments, the distilled RCBAM\u2013TCN\u2013LSTM model achieved average reductions of 40%\u201360% in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE compared with the original RCBAM and TCN\u2013LSTM models, while improving R\u00b2 by 4%\u20136%. The approach maintained high accuracy across different prediction horizons while reducing computational complexity.DiscussionThe proposed method effectively balances high-precision modeling of spatiotemporal dependencies with lightweight deployment requirements, enabling real-time air-traffic monitoring and early warning on standard CPUs and embedded devices. This framework offers a scalable solution for enhancing the operational safety and efficiency of modern air-traffic control systems.",

    "title": "Variable admittance control with sEMG-based support for wearable wrist exoskeleton",
    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

The idea is to build visuals by describing them as simple layouts, instead of calculating <code>(x, y)</code> coordinates for everything.</p> <p>For example, I used it to generate this fake Reddit post card:</p> <p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JUFXMzK.png\">Resulting Image</a></p> <p>This whole image was created with the Python code below. It handles all the layout, font fallbacks, text wrapping, and rendering for you.</p> <p>```python from pictex import *</p> <h1>--- 1. Define the small components ---</h1> <p>upvote_icon = Image(&quot;upvote.png&quot;) downvote_icon = Image(&quot;downvote.png&quot;) comment_icon = Image(&quot;comment.png&quot;).resize(0.7) python_icon = Image(&quot;python_logo.png&quot;).size(25, 25).border_radius('50%')</p> <p>flair = Text(&quot;Showcase&quot;).font_size(12).padding(2, 6).background_color(&quot;#0079D3&quot;).color(&quot;white&quot;).border_radius(10)</p> <h1>--- 2.

You build your image by nesting components (<code>Row</code>, <code>Column</code>, <code>Text</code>, <code>Image</code>), and the library figures out all the sizing and positioning for you, using a model inspired by CSS Flexbox. You can style any element with padding, borders, backgrounds, and shadows. It also handles fonts and emojis, automatically finding fallbacks if a character isn't supported.</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>It's for any Python dev who wants to create images from code, especially when the content is dynamic. For example: * Automating social media posts or quote images. * Generating Open Graph images for a website on the fly. * Creating parts of an infographic or a report.</p> <p>The project is currently in Beta. It's pretty solid for most common use cases, but you might still find some rough edges.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>vs. Pillow/OpenCV:</strong> Think of Pillow/OpenCV as a digital canvas where you have to specify the exact <code>(x, y)</code> coordinates for everything you draw.

    "title": "I built a programming language interpreted in Python!",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey!</p> <p>I'd like to share a project I've been working on: A functional programming language that I built entirely in Python.</p> <p>I'm primarily a Python developer, but I wanted to understand functional programming concepts better. Instead of just reading about them, I decided to build my own FP language from scratch. It started as a tiny DSL (domain specific language) for a specific problem (which it turned out to be terrible for!), but I enjoyed the core ideas enough to expand it into a full functional language.</p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>NumFu is a pure functional programming language interpreted in Python featuring: - <strong>Arbitrary precision arithmetic</strong> using <code>mpmath</code> - no floating point issues - <strong>Automatic partial application</strong> and function composition - <strong>Built-in testing syntax</strong> with readable assertions - <strong>Tail call optimization</strong> for efficient recursion - <strong>Clean syntax</strong> with only four types (Number, Boolean, List, String)</p> <p>Here's a taste of the syntax:</p> <p>```numfu // Functions automatically partially apply</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>{a, b, c -&gt; a + b + c}(_, 5) {a, c -&gt; a+5+c} // Even prints as readable syntax!</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>// Composition and pipes let add1 = {x -&gt; x + 1}, double = {x -&gt; x * 2} in 5 |&gt; (add1 &gt;&gt; double) // 12</p> <p>// Built-in testing let square = {x -&gt; x * x} in square(7) ---&gt; $ == 49 // \u2713 passes ```</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a production language - it's 2-5x slower than Python due to double interpretation. It's more of a learning tool for: - Teaching functional programming concepts without complex syntax - Sketching mathematical algorithms where precision matters more than speed - Understanding how interpreters work</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>NumFu has much simpler syntax than traditional functional languages like Haskell or ML and no complex type system - just four basic types. It's less powerful but much more approachable. I designed it to make FP concepts accessible without getting bogged down in advanced language features. Think of it as functional programming with training wheels.</p> <h2>Implementation Details</h2> <p>The implementation is about 3,500 lines of Python using: - <em>Lark</em> for parsing - <em>Tree-walking interpreter</em> - straightforward recursive evaluation<br /> - <em>mpmath</em> for arbitrary precision arithmetic</p> <h2>Try It Out</h2> <p><code>bash pip install numfu-lang numfu repl </code></p> <h2>Links</h2> <p>I actually enjoy web design, so NumFu has a (probably overly fancy) landing page + documentation site. \ud83d\ude05</p> <ul> <li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/rphle/numfu\">https://github.com/rphle/numfu</a><br /></li> <li>Website: <a href=\"https://rphle.github.io/numfu/\">https://rphle.github.io/numfu/</a></li> <li>Documentation: <a href=\"https://rphle.github.io/numfu/docs\">https://rphle.github.io/numfu/docs</a></li> <li>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/numfu-lang/\">https://pypi.org/project/numfu-lang/</a></li> </ul> <p>I built this as a learning exercise and it's been fun to work on. Happy to answer questions about design choices or implementation details! I also really appreciate issues and pull requests!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/piequals-3\"> /u/piequals-3 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nbkguo/i_built_a_programming_language_interpreted_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nbkguo/i_built_a_programming_language_interpreted_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.04676v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria, aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors. Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.04510v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students. In particular, the research investigates whether VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test, but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia, particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.",

    "title": "Conversational AI increases political knowledge as effectively as self-directed internet search",
    "content": "arXiv:2509.05219v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conversational AI systems are increasingly being used in place of traditional search engines to help users complete information-seeking tasks. This has raised concerns in the political domain, where biased or hallucinated outputs could misinform voters or distort public opinion. However, in spite of these concerns, the extent to which conversational AI is used for political information-seeking, as well the potential impact of this use on users' political knowledge, remains uncertain. Here, we address these questions: First, in a representative national survey of the UK public (N = 2,499), we find that in the week before the 2024 election as many as 32% of chatbot users - and 13% of eligible UK voters - have used conversational AI to seek political information relevant to their electoral choice. Second, in a series of randomised controlled trials (N = 2,858 total) we find that across issues, models, and prompting strategies, conversations with AI increase political knowledge (increase belief in true information and decrease belief in misinformation) to the same extent as self-directed internet search. Taken together, our results suggest that although people in the UK are increasingly turning to conversational AI for information about politics, this shift may not lead to increased public belief in political misinformation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.05166v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many transport authorities are collecting and publishing almost real-time road traffic data to meet the growing trend of massive open data, a vital resource for foresight decision support systems considering deep data insights. Using such a traffic count dataset, we explored the spatio-temporal transitions in the cross-country road traffic volumes in the context of modelling behavioural transitions in car-based human mobility. We developed a reproducible workflow for computing multi-dimensional variables of traffic flow. This study reports on individual car-based daily travel behaviour detected, before (2016-2018) and during the COVID pandemic (2019-2021), between Germany and neighbouring countries (Luxembourg, France and Belgium). In relevance to the net-zero carbon transition, further study should shed light on the interpolation and downscaling approaches at the comprehensive road-network level for identifying pollution hot spots, causal link to functional landuse patterns and calculation of spatial influence area. In the case of Luxembourg, the Bridges and Roads Authority has installed a large digital traffic observatory infrastructure through the adoption of sensor-based IoT technologies, like other European member states. Since 2016, they have provided high-performance data processing and published open data on the country's road traffic. The dataset contains an hourly traffic count for different vehicle types, daily for representative observation points, followed by a major road network. The original dataset contains significant missing entries, so comprehensive data harmonization was performed.",

By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped by users and contexts.",

In spite of what marketing suggests, research still lacks an understanding of the long-term usage of such devices in ecologically valid everyday settings, as most studies are conducted in very controlled environments. Therefore, we conducted interviews with ten AVP users to better understand how experienced users engage with the device, and which limitations persist. Our participants report that XR can increase productivity and that they got used to the device after some time. Yet, a range of limitations persist that might hinder the widespread use of XR as a productivity tool, such as a lack of native applications, difficulties when integrating XR into current workflows, and limited possibilities to adapt and customize the XR experience.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.05023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Animating realistic avatars requires using high quality animations for every possible state the avatar can be in. This includes actions like walking or running, but also subtle movements that convey emotions and personality. Idle animations, such as standing, breathing or looking around, are crucial for realism and believability. In games and virtual applications, these are often handcrafted or recorded with actors, but this is costly. Furthermore, recording realistic idle animations can be very complex, because the actor must not know they are being recorded in order to make genuine movements. For this reasons idle animation datasets are not widely available. Nevertheless, this paper concludes that both acted and genuine idle animations are perceived as real, and that users are not able to distinguish between them. It also states that handmade and recorded idle animations are perceived differently. These two conclusions mean that recording idle animations should be easier than it is thought to be, meaning that actors can be specifically told to act the movements, significantly simplifying the recording process. These conclusions should help future efforts to record idle animation datasets. Finally, we also publish ReActIdle, a 3 dimensional idle animation dataset containing both real and acted idle motions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.04705v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Fashion has evolved from handcrafted designs to automated production over the years, where AI has added another dimension to it. Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately $80\\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\\%$ for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.",

This study explores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used to train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a specific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI cooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different self-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial identities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural perspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After the game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the strategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived intelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data revealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic, as well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the treatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results indicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a positive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White participants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A baseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was used to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the participants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model helps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies of the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as cognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways racialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI systems.",

    "content": "Reading and speech recognition rely on multi-level processing that builds from basic visual or sound features to complete word representations, yet details of these processing hierarchies (in particular those for spoken words) are still poorly understood. We re-analyzed the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data provided in the Mother Of all Unification Studies (MOUS) open-science dataset by using parametric regressions of word frequency and sublexical unit (bigram or syllable) frequency during reading and speech listening tasks in order to elucidate lexical processing hierarchies in the visual and auditory modalities. We first validated our approach in the written word domain, where the technique identified significant correlations for word frequency in the left mid-fusiform cortex (at the location of the Visual Word Form Area) with a left occipital region tracking bigram frequency, compatible with prior reports. During listening, low-frequency spoken words elicited greater responses in a left mid-superior temporal region consistent with the recently-described Auditory Word Form Area (AWFA), while a more posterior region of the superior temporal gyrus was sensitive to syllable frequency. Activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with both written and spoken word frequency. These findings demonstrate parallel hierarchical organizations in the anteroventral visual and auditory streams, with modality-specific lexica and upstream sublexical representations that converge in higher-order language areas.",

    "content": "Understanding how the brain encodes information started with a map but turned into a maze: paths multiplied; boundaries blurred. Neurons tuned to specific features are not confined to single regions, but distributed across the cortex. Retinotopy, once thought limited to early visual areas, now appears in over 20 cortical regions, from the tip of the occipital cortex to the shore of the lateral frontal cortex. To describe and understand these complex mosaics of functional specialization, we focus on the spatial influences that shape their emergence across the cortical sheet. To this end, we developed Spatial Component Decomposition (SCD), a sparse dictionary learning framework that locates sources of spatial influence without relying on prior assumptions from systems neuroscience. Applied to MRI data capturing retinotopic maps, SCD reveals a dominant linear gradient extending over 60 mm from V1 and covering all the known posterior visual areas. Yet, it also revealed systematic competition from other primary sensory areas and default mode transmodal hubs. These suppressive influences shape the cortical embedding of visual information, even during purely visual tasks. Our results suggest that functional specialization emerges from spatial competition between representational systems, not just from feedforward inputs.",

The functional disability left by TBI, is significant for the patient, family and society. Treatment and early rehabilitation are crucial to the overall level of recovery.ObjectiveTo compare the impact of extended early rehabilitation of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury on the outcome of treatment.MaterialA prospective experimental study comprised 124 patients with moderate and severe TBI, randomly divided into two groups. The patients of the experimental group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 45 min, and the patients of the control group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 30 min. The follow-up parameters were: age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and discharge, early rehabilitation interruptions, presence of tracheostomy, decubitus ulcers, nasogastric tube, diapers and urinary catheter at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and discharge from the hospital, and mortality.Results124 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 62 patients each. The male gender dominated 95 (76.6%). The average age was Me = 62.00 (IQR = 36.0) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in gender, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries and comorbidities. GCS on admission; 68 (54.8%) patients had severe, 56 (46.2%) moderate TBI, at discharge: 22 (17.7%) had severe, 11 (8.9%) moderate and 91 (73.4%) mild TBI. At discharge from the ICU, the presence of tracheostomy was (13 vs. 19), (p = 0.218), nasogastric tube (33 vs. 45), (p = 0.026) and decubitus ulcers (0 vs. 4), (p = 0.042) were less in the experimental group. At discharge from the hospital, tracheostomy (6 vs. 16), (p = 0.019), urinary catheter (38 vs. 48), (p = 0.051), diapers (29 vs. 40), (p = 0.047) were less in the experimental group. There were 5 deaths in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in early rehabilitation interruptions between groups (5 vs. 6).ConclusionExtended early TBI rehabilitation is safe, effective and contributes to a positive outcome of treatment.",

    "title": "Imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning for sparse badminton strikes via dynamic trajectory generation",
    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

    "content": "Upper limb amputation significantly affects daily functioning and quality of life. Although myoelectric prostheses offer a promising avenue for restoring motor capabilities, high rates of device abandonment underscore challenges in control performance and user integration. Recent advances in high-density electromyography (HD-EMG) and machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown potential to enhance prosthetic dexterity. HD-EMG interfaces capture richer spatial and temporal muscle activation data, while ML algorithms exploit this information to improve intention detection and motion control. This mini-review explores advancements in HD-EMG acquisition systems, including both interface designs and recording technologies, as well as ML algorithms leveraging spatial information. In addition to summarizing the current state of the art, we discuss the challenges and the opportunities of embedding these technologies in prosthetic systems, with the objective of facilitating the translation of laboratory research into clinical applications.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe neural mechanisms underlying somatosensory processing in individuals with acquired single-sided deafness (SSD) and potential central neuronal cross-modal reorganization remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the impact of SSD on somatosensory perception and attentional processing.MethodsElectrophysiological responses using EEG, and behavioral measures (discrimination thresholds, hit rates and reaction times) were assessed in adults with acquired SSD and normal-hearing (NH) controls for vibrotactile stimulation at two distinct frequencies. Differences in cortical somatosensory evoked potentials between adults with acquired SSD and normal-hearing (NH) controls, focusing on peak amplitudes and peak times of key event-related potential components (P50, N70, P100, N140, and P3b) and their cortical generators were assessed.ResultsWhile both groups exhibited comparable behavioral performance, significant differences emerged in electrophysiological responses. Individuals with SSD showed increased P3b amplitude (albeit non-significant) and significantly delayed P3b peak times, indicating that individuals with acquired SSD exhibit alterations in attentional mechanisms associated with somatosensory perception. In addition, source localization analysis of the P50 component using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) revealed group differences in cortical activation patterns, with SSD individual showing additional recruitment of auditory-related areas, including the superior temporal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus and the insula. This further supports the notion of compensatory neuroplasticity in auditory pathways following severe to profound unilateral hearing loss.ConclusionOur results indicate that SSD is associated with neural reorganization in somatosensory and auditory pathways. The observed modifications in both early and late somatosensory responses, coupled with alterations in source activity, suggest that individuals with SSD engage alternative neural mechanisms when processing vibrotactile stimuli, differing from the typical patterns observed in NH individuals. Understanding these changes prior to cochlear implantation will facilitate the development of personalized auditory rehabilitation strategies following cochlear implantation.",

    "title": "Molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease onset in a mouse model: effects of cannabidiol treatment",
    "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative condition involving a complex blend of disturbances in synaptic development and maintenance, neurovascular cross-talk, ionic and nutrient transport, and mitochondrial metabolism. The precise molecular profile of AD onset with insight for major pathological contributors remains unclear with corresponding impedances in therapeutic development. The current study sought two objectives, as (i) to resolve the molecular pathogenesis from cognitive impairment to the onset of AD-like neuropathology and (ii) whether the novel agent cannabidiol (CBD), noted for its neuroprotective effects, influences the molecular transition associated with AD onset.MethodsDietary CBD was administered daily (80\u2013100 mg/kg/day) in male 3xTg-AD mice and wild-type B6129SF2/J animals from 4.5 to 6.5 mo of age with inclusion of vehicle controls. RNA sequencing encompassed longitudinal and cross-sectional blood and brain samples, respectively. Metabolomics and behavioral analyses examined brain regions (cortex, hippocampus) and associated integrated neurocircuitry.Results and discussionThere were >1,000 differentially expressed markers of AD onset, whereby >75% were either eliminated or reversed in the direction of expression in response to CBD. Signaling pathways encompassed synaptic development and plasticity (e.g., Foxp2), neurovascular interactions (Smad9, Angptl6), receptors and ion channels (Gria4, Chrna2, Rgs7/Rgs7bp), mitochondrial genes (Ndufa7, Cox7a2), immunity (Ncr1), oxidation-reduction (Esr1), lipid synthesis (Fasn, ApoE), and carbohydrate metabolism (Mafa, Mlxipl). As potentially addressable with CBD treatment, AD onset represents molecular integration of neurovascular interactions, channelopathies, metabolic disturbances, and aberrations in developmental genes with involvement of major pathological contributors such as inflammation, oxidative signaling, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.",

The findings demonstrate that TMS stimulation may originate from more global and interhemispheric effects, but that iTBS on the left-DLPFC induces decreases in oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO) providing the potential links for beneficial effects in cognition.",

    "content": "arXiv:2503.14333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Studies often aim to reveal ``first-order\" representations (FORs), which encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as contents or structure. A less-common target is ``higher-order\" representations (HORs), which are ``about\" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs\" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored. Here, we study ``noise expectation\" HORs using neural data from a task which may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback, wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.",

Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of \"in-context learning\" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples. Here, we show that the dynamic interplay between ICL and default in-weight learning (IWL) naturally captures a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, reproducing curriculum effects on category-learning and compositional tasks, and recapitulating a tradeoff between flexibility and retention. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.",

    "content": "arXiv:2208.09677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.",

    "content": "arXiv:2508.13846v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.",

Building on the geometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed learning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the recurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature enabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at convergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach performs competitively on standard AI benchmarks. The model can be generalized in multiple directions, both computational and biological, potentially contributing to narrowing the gap between AI and computational neuroscience.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.04633v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation. Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a controlled biological substrate.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.05151v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and widespread disruptions in brain function. Computational modeling has advanced our understanding of these processes, but efforts have traditionally focused on either neuronal dynamics or the underlying biological mechanisms of disease. One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain frameworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network stability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease progression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, and glial responses and vascular mechanisms. Each modeling tradition has provided important insights, but experimental evidence shows these processes are interconnected: neuronal activity modulates protein release and clearance, while pathological burden feeds back to disrupt circuit function. Modeling these domains in isolation limits our understanding. To determine where and why disease emerges, how it spreads, and how it might be altered, we must develop integrated frameworks that capture feedback between neuronal dynamics and disease biology. In this review, we survey the two modeling approaches and highlight efforts to unify them. We argue that such integration is necessary to address key questions in neurodegeneration and to inform interventions, from targeted stimulation to control-theoretic strategies that slow progression and restore function.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.04454v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: My findings show, for the first time, what causes loss of awareness, anesthesia, memory replay, opioids induced respiratory depression (OIRD), and slow wave sleep. Opiates are fast pain relievers and anesthetics that can cause respiratory arrest. I found how mu-opioids and other medial habenula activators slowdown respiration during SWS and anesthesia. Using DTI method I observed that human hippocampus is connected to MHb via posterior septum, while amygdala via anteromedial BNST. MHb projected to pineal gland and contralateral MHb (Vadovi\\v{c}ov\\'a, 2014). MHb has dense mu-opioids receptors (Gardon and Faget, 2014) and strong projections to IPN. Herkenham (1981) found increased glucose intake during anesthesia in MHb and IPN. The IPN projects to serotonergic MRN/DRN, and pain/interoception/arousal linked PAG. The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? This extended circuit model explains role of the dentate gyrus >posterior septum >MHb >IPN >MRN >hippocampus + BF + claustrum >cortical slow-wave activity (SWA) in memory replay, loss of awareness, anesthesia and SWS. It proposes new neural mechanisms for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN >MRN >claustrum >cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. This brain model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence and wanting. This model suggests that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, cannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, neuropeptide Y, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-proteins production-spines/synapses growth-anti-inflammatory state.",

    "content": "Humans can readily perceive animacy from biological motion (BM) - the distinctive movement patterns of living entities. However, how the human brain extracts animacy information from BM remains largely unclear. The current study investigated this issue using visual adaptation, a non-invasive tool for revealing neural mechanisms underlying the selective processing of specific properties. Results showed that prolonged exposure to intact human walkers, compared to non-BM adaptors, biased the perception of subsequent walking stimuli towards less animate. This adaptation aftereffect persisted following adaptation to local foot motions carrying diagnostic kinematic cues, but was absent after exposure to static body forms, indicating the involvement of neuronal populations encoding animacy from BM based on motion signals. Moreover, adapting to pigeon movements also biased animacy perception for human motions, revealing a shared mechanism for encoding animacy from cross-species BM signals. These results support the existence of an inherent \"life detection\" system in the human brain, attuned to local foot motions and kinematic features prevalent in vertebrate movements, which may lay a foundation for perceiving life from motion across terrestrial species.",

    "content": "Objective. Optogenetic inhibition of excitatory neuronal populations has emerged as a potential strategy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. However, achieving effective seizure suppression in animal models using optogenetic techniques has proven challenging. This difficulty can be attributed to a suboptimal stimulation method that involves numerous complex variables. This study aims to examine how various stimulation parameters and opsin characteristics influence the efficacy of optogenetic inhibition protocols. Additionally, a new opsin model is introduced that permits easy implementation of the experimentally derived parameters describing the opsin\u2019s opening and closing dynamics. Approach. The mathematical description of a chloride and potassium conducting opsin was combined with a conductance-based model of a pyramidal CA1 neuron. Simulations with varying parameters were conducted to explore the effects of the stimulation paradigm and the neuronal environment on inhibition. A simplified, adaptable opsin model was used to test the robustness of these results and explore the impact of variations in opsin characteristics. Main results. Stronger inhibition was achieved with higher illumination intensities, pulse repetition frequencies, and duty cycles. Potassium conducting opsins were found to be more stable than chloride conducting ones. These findings were independent of the opsin\u2019s parameters. Additionally, changes in the opsin\u2019s dynamics had negligible impact when the opening and closing time constants were varied by factors between 0.5 and 2. Significance. This study provides key insights into the stimulation and physiological parameters that affect optogenetic inhibition. The findings highlight the importance of choosing the right stimulation protocol and opsin for optimizing optogenetic strategies. The newly developed opsin model also offers a new, valuable tool that will facilitate future research into the development of an improved optogenetic modulation protocol for seizure suppression.",

    "content": "Objective. Sensory prostheses use arrays of electrodes to stimulate neural tissue and restore a sense of vision or hearing. At perceptible levels of stimulation, the current from each electrode spreads and causes overlapping regions of neural activation. This lack of specificity results in perceptual deficits. Methods to overcome this reduced specificity, such as a closed loop stimulation approach require measurement of the neural response to stimulation. This investigation tests the possibility of using the large stimulating electrodes such as those required by some subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal implants to measure the neural response to stimulation, an approach similar to Evoked Compound Action Potentials measurements used in cochlear implants. Approach. Ex vivo tissue samples from Long Evans rats with healthy retinas and Royal College of Surgeon rats with retinal degeneration were used to investigate both stimulating and recording from electrodes of the same array. A hexagonal array was used with 20 platinum electrodes with 500 \u03bcm diameter and 700 \u03bcm pitch. Post-stimulus voltage decay was reduced with appropriate tuning of a triphasic stimulation pulse and in post-analysis with a high-pass filter. A method using alternating polarities of biphasic pulses was also trialed. A cocktail of synaptic and ion channel blockers was used to block all neural response including action potentials and thus confirm the biological origin of the signal. Main Results. It was found that a neural signal was observable on electrode that were sufficiently distant from the stimulating electrodes. The signal appeared to be due to direct activation of ganglion cells or possibly mediated via inner retinal neurons. Significance. This result confirms that recording usable neural signals from large electrodes is possible, which is an essential step in implementing a closed loop stimulation strategy for a subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis.",

    "content": "Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Yet, optimizing lead placement and stimulation programming remains challenging. Current techniques rely on imaging and intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MER), while programming relies on trial-and-error clinical testing, which can be time-consuming. DBS-induced local evoked potentials (DLEP), also known as evoked resonant neural activity, have emerged as a potential alternative electrophysiological marker for mapping. However, direct comparisons with traditional spectral features, such as beta-band, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and aperiodic component are lacking. Approach. We evaluated DLEP across 39 STN DBS leads in 31 subjects with PD undergoing DBS surgery, using both a single-pulse and high-frequency (HF) burst stimulation paradigms. We developed a novel artifact-removal method to enable monopolar DLEP recovery, including estimating the DLEP amplitudes at stimulated contacts, further enhancing spatial sampling of DLEP. We evaluated spectral features and DLEP in respect to imaging-based and MER-based localization, and its predictive power for post-operative programming. Main results. DLEP showed great spatial consistency, maximizing within STN with 100% accuracy for single-pulse and 84.62% for burst stimulation, surpassing spectral measures including beta (89.74%) and HFO (82.05%). DLEP better correlated with clinical outcomes (single-pulses \u03c1 = \u22120.33, HF bursts \u03c1 = \u22120.26), than spectral measures (beta \u03c1 = \u22120.25, HFO \u03c1 = 0.05). Furthermore, single-pulses at low-frequencies are sufficient for DLEP-based mapping. Significance. We show how DLEP provide higher STN-spatial specificity and correlation with postoperative programming compared to spectral features. To support clinical translation of DLEP, we developed two methods aimed to recover artifact-free DLEP and estimating DLEP amplitudes at stimulating contacts. DLEP appear distinct from beta and HFO activity, yet strongly tied to aperiodic spectral components, suggesting that DLEP amplitude reflects underlying STN excitability. This study highlights that DLEP are a robust and clinically valuable marker for DBS targeting and programming.",

Despite concerns regarding its spatial precision, the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with fNIRS for validating signal localization has not been systematically explored. This study aimed to demonstrate the interindividual variability in hand motor representations and how it influences the precision of fNIRS recordings during motor tasks. Approach. Neuronavigated TMS was employed on 18 neurotypical adults to map the motor representations of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and fourth dorsal interosseous (4DI) muscles. Center-of-gravity (CoG) coordinates from TMS-evoked motor maps were compared with fNIRS channel locations, including the theoretical hand channel defined by the 10-20 EEG system. FNIRS signals were recorded during a hand-grasp motor task, and the subject-specific hand channel was determined by identifying the fNIRS channel closest to the individual\u2019s TMS CoG. Main Results. TMS motor mapping revealed substantial interindividual variability, with 56% of participants demonstrating deviations from the theoretical fNIRS hand channel. TMS motor maps showed that the FDI and 4DI representations were closely positioned, with the 4DI representation slightly anterior to the FDI (p = 0.022). Analysis of fNIRS signals indicated that subject-specific hand channels exhibited significantly higher hemodynamic response amplitudes compared to the theoretical hand channel (p = 0.0004), suggesting enhanced signal sensitivity when using individualized cortical mapping. Additionally, fNIRS signal variance was significantly higher in the theoretical channel, indicating greater signal variability and lower signal robustness. Significance. These findings highlight the limitations of rigidly applying the 10-20 EEG system for spatial localization in fNIRS-based motor studies and show the benefits of integrating TMS-derived cortical mapping for improved signal accuracy and robustness.",

    "content": "Objective. The precise mapping of speech-related functions is crucial for successful neurosurgical interventions in epilepsy and brain tumor cases. Traditional methods like electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) are effective but carry a significant risk of inducing seizures. Methods. To address this, we have prepared a comprehensive ESM\u2009+\u2009electrocorticographic mapping (ECM) dataset from 14 patients with chronically implanted stereo-EEG electrodes. Then we explored several compact machine learning (ML) approaches to convert the ECM signals to the ground truth derived from the risky ESM procedure. Both procedures involved the standard picture naming task. As features, we used gamma-band power within successive temporal windows in the data averaged with respect to picture and voice onsets. We focused on a range of classifiers, including XGBoost, linear support vector classification (SVC), regularized logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, multi-Layer perceptron, AdaBoost and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers and equipped them with confidence interval estimates, crucial in a real-life application. We validated the ML approaches using a leave-one-patient-out procedure and computed ROC and Precision\u2013Recall curves for various feature combinations. Results. For linear SVC we achieved ROC-AUC and PR-AUC scores of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, which effectively distinguishes speech-related from non-related iEEG channels. We have also observed that the use of information on the voice onset moment notably improved the classification accuracy. Significance. We have for the first time rigorously compared the ECM and ESM results and mimicked a real-life use of the ECM technology. We have also provided public access to the comprehensive ECM+ESM dataset to pave the road towards safer and more reliable eloquent cortex mapping procedures.",

    "content": "Objective. Human\u2013robot collaboration in lower-limb rehabilitation devices imposes stringent requirements on both the recognition accuracy of motion intention and real-time responsiveness. The precise recognition of lower limb motion based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has always been a primary focus of study. However, achieving low-delay recognition in lower limb continuous motion while maintaining accuracy remains a challenge, which is key to unlocking the full potential for the effective deployment and widespread application of robots. Approach. An innovative recognition method in lower limb continuous motion was presented in this paper, which investigated the instantaneous recognition network (IRN) and continuous recognition (CR) model. Main results. The comparative analysis revealed that by utilizing an optimal length of 210 for the onset-window sEMG data, the proposed IRN could substantially reduce the time delay from 300 ms/350 ms to 60 ms at the methodological level. The implementation of the class-balanced method enhanced motion recognition accuracy by an additional 4.83% within the onset window. The CR model was validated across seven scenarios, comprehensively covering all potential situations in daily continuous movements, and achieved an average accuracy of 96.31%. Significance. This study demonstrates the potential of the proposed instantaneous recognition method to enhance performance in lower limb continuous motion, providing an innovative approach for research on human\u2013robot synchronization.",

    "title": "Extracting robust single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials for non-invasive brain computer interfaces",
    "content": "Objective. Reliable extraction of single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) is essential for developing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications to support rehabilitation after brain injury. For real-time feedback, these responses must be extracted prospectively on every trial, with minimal post-processing and artifact correction. However, noninvasive SEPs elicited by electrical stimulation at recommended parameter settings (0.1\u20130.2 msec pulse width, stimulation at or below motor threshold, 2\u20135 Hz frequency) are typically small and variable, often requiring averaging across multiple trials or extensive processing. Here, we describe and evaluate ways to optimize the stimulation setup to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of noninvasive single-trial SEPs, enabling more reliable extraction. Approach. SEPs were recorded with scalp electroencephalography in tibial nerve stimulation in thirteen healthy people, and two people with CNS injuries. Three stimulation frequencies (lower than recommended: 0.2 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz) with a pulse width longer than recommended (1 msec), at a stimulation intensity based on H-reflex and M-wave at Soleus muscle were evaluated. Detectability of single-trial SEPs relative to background noise was tested offline and in a pseudo-online analysis, followed by a real-time demonstration. Mainresults. SEP N70 was observed predominantly at the central scalp regions. Online decoding performance was significantly higher with Laplacian filter. Generalization performance showed an expected degradation, at all frequencies, with an average decrease of 5.9% (multivariate) and 6.5% (univariate), with an AUC score ranging from 0.78\u20130.90. The difference across stimulation frequencies was not significant. In individuals with injuries, AUC of 0.86 (incomplete spinal cord injury) and 0.81 (stroke) was feasible. Real-time demonstration showed SEP detection with AUC of 0.89. Significance. This study describes and evaluates a system for extracting single-trial SEPs in real-time, suitable for a BCI-based operant conditioning. It enhances SNR of individual SEPs by alternate electrical stimulation parameters, dry headset, and optimized signal processing.",

    "title": "Unveiling functional heterogeneity in anatomical functional areas: a framework for fine-grained functional connectivity analysis of wide-field calcium imaging data",
    "content": "Objective. Conventional functional connectivity (FC) analysis of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data relies on the assumption of homogeneity within predefined anatomical functional areas (FAs), where the signal averaged within each FA serves as the foundation for inter-FA connectivity modeling. However, accumulating evidence suggested significant intra-FA functional heterogeneity with functionally distinct subregions. This study aims to systematically examine the existence of the heterogeneity and the consequences of violating the homogeneity assumption on the FC analysis. Approach. We propose a three-step approach: (1) The spatiotemporal clustering of pixels with similar activity dynamics into functional parcels (FPs). (2) Classifying FPs according to their cortex-wide connectivity profiles into four categories: cross-hemispheric (CH), unihemispheric (UH), cross-modal (CM) and unimodal (UM). (3) Gauging the consequences and utility of above analysis. Main results. Analysis of adult mice WFCI data (n = 6) shows that pixels can be reliably clustered into FPs, and that FPs fall into different categories and form distinct subregions, unveiling the functional heterogeneity within each FA. Crucially, fine-grained FC analysis for different categories of subregions uncovered significant differences compared to the results from the conventional method. Application of the analysis to longitudinal WFCI data on mouse brain development (n = 17) demonstrates increases in CM and CH subregions and decreases in UM and UH subregions over time, in line with expectations based on prior research into neurodevelopment and network reorganization. Significance. The present study develops a fine-grained FC analysis framework, leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution of WFCI to more precisely characterize large-scale cortical network dynamics. The observed differences between FCs derived using the proposed framework and those from conventional methods highlight the need for caution regarding the functional homogeneity assumption in conventional FC analysis. Furthermore, the developmental regularities revealed in longitudinal mouse brain data demonstrate the utility of fine-grained FC analysis.",

Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a kind of high-quality intracranial signal with good spatiotemporal resolution that offers some new opportunities. However, according to our knowledge, there are no studies to reconstruct the perceived images from human ECoG signals at present. Approach. We have conducted the pioneering work and developed a novel pipeline that integrates Talairach coordinate alignment masked autoencoders (TA-MAE) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our approach exploits the spatiotemporal dynamics of human ECoG signals, enabling the restoration of details in high-resolution. Main results. Experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of appearance, structure, signal-noise ratio, and semantic consistency. Additionally, our study indicated that unsupervised learning-based signal reconstruction outperforms manually annotated label-guided feature recognition in capturing the low-dimensional representation of brain signals, potentially facilitating the exploration of vision\u2019s intrinsic mechanisms. Significance. These results highlight the advantages of unsupervised decoding and provide a generalizable framework for human ECoG-based visual reconstruction.",

    "title": "Using time-resolved auditory frequency tagging to capture self-preferential processing of the own (vs other) name",
    "content": "The own name is an important, salient self-related stimulus and ostensive cue. Prioritized processing of ones own name plays a key role in attention, self-awareness, and social and cognitive development. Previous studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have reported a self-preferential effect for the own name, characterized by enhanced neural responses compared to the names of (close) others. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate an EEG auditory frequency-tagging task to measure self-preferential processing of the own name, leveraging the superior signal-to-noise ratio of this technique, which is highly relevant for future studies on infants and clinical populations. To this end, we ran two separate studies (dichotic: n1 = 31, non-dichotic: n2 = 32). In contrast to previous ERP research, we did not find evidence of a self-preferential effect. We reasoned that collapsing temporal information may have led to the failure to capture the effect, which ERP research has shown to emerge at a late stage of processing, and that this effect may have been overshadowed by early brain responses. To address this issue, we applied a novel approach that we refer to as the time-resolved frequency tagging approach, which incorporates knowledge of the effect in the temporal domain. This did result in a clear self-preferential effect of the own name. Hence, we were able to develop and validate an EEG frequency-tagging task to measure the self-preferential effect of the own name. Our approach can also be used in future EEG frequency-tagging studies investigating other complex cognitive processes.",

It is designed for studying spontaneous fluctuations in the neurocognitive state related to the tonic alertness of computer users, with recordings from 42 participants over 2-hour sessions. Within a simulated desktop environment, participants performed real-world routine tasks, including application switching, file management, typing, and web browsing. High-resolution data were recorded across physiological (electroencephalography, electrocardiography, respiration) and subjective modalities of alertness. At five-minute intervals, alertness state was reported using seven questions, addressing sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale), mental and temporal demand, perceived performance, effort and frustration (NASA Task Load Index), as well as attentiveness. Behavioural data included keyboard, mouse and webcam inputs. Demographic information for the experience, habits, and preferences of computer usage was collected. In addition, individual differences in sleep quality were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The SENSE-42 dataset can contribute to future research in user state monitoring, behavioural analysis and physiological computing.",

    "content": "Perceived sleep depth is a key determinant of subjective sleep quality, traditionally thought to reflect unconsciousness and reduced cortical activation. Here, we combined high-density EEG with a serial awakening paradigm during NREM sleep to examine its neural and experiential correlates. As expected, deeper sleep was associated with reduced cortical activation, reflected in a lower high-to-low frequency power ratio. Yet, this relationship weakened in the presence of dreaming, indicating that immersive conscious experiences can counteract the impact of cortical activation on perceived depth. Indeed, perceived sleep depth was lowest during states with a mere sense of presence and highest during immersive dreaming or deep unconsciousness. Across the night, physiological sleep pressure and subjective sleepiness declined, but perceived sleep depth rose alongside increasing dream immersiveness. These results challenge the view that deep sleep stems solely from reduced brain activity and suggest that immersive dreaming sustains perceived sleep depth as homeostatic pressure wanes.",

    "title": "NERV: A Comprehensive Framework for Rapid, Reproducible, and Hardware-Synchronized Neuroscience Experiment Design and Execution",
    "content": "Background: Behavioral neuroscience experiments require precise stimulus control, millisecond timing, hardware integration, and robust data provenance. Increasing use of 3D environments and multimodal recordings adds challenges for development, accessibility, and reproducibility. Fragmented tools often separate presentation, synchronization, and logging, leading to inefficiencies. New Method: The Neuroscience Experimental Runtime by Vanderbilt (NERV) is a Unity-based framework that unifies experiment design, execution, and data logging. It enables rapid, no-code prototyping by automating scene and script generation, event timing, state management, hardware-synchronized data acquisition, and archival of code and experimental configurations. The modular, open-source framework implements a \"low floor, high ceiling\" design that lowers barriers for non-programmers while remaining extensible for advanced customization. Results: Across 500 trials, Unity-to-TTL delay was 2.10 +/- 1.21 ms, TTL-to-photodiode delay was 28.93 +/- 0.76 ms, and Unity-to-screen delay was 31.04 +/- 1.41 ms. These results confirm stable millisecond precision and frame-locked timing, enabling reliable alignment of neural, behavioral, and visual events. Comparison with existing methods: Existing frameworks involve trade-offs. Some achieve precise timing but require advanced coding, while others improve accessibility but struggle with hardware or 3D graphics. Commercial platforms offer polish yet remain costly, closed-source, and inflexible. NERV combines millisecond precision, modular open-source design, and provenance in a single platform, reducing workflow fragmentation and enabling reproducible, scalable experiments. Conclusion: NERV is an accessible yet extensible framework that unites rapid development, robust data provenance, and millisecond precision. It accelerates development, ensures reproducibility, and establishes a scalable foundation for next-generation neuroscience research.",

    "title": "A Novel Mechanism for Tauopathy in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: Excitotoxic Misplacement of a Mitochondrial Anchor into Dendrites Driven by Tau-hyperphosphorylation",
    "content": "On April 2nd, 2025, the FDA approved a Fast Track Designation for Biogen to use Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASO) to treat tauopathy in clinical trials for Alzheimer Disease (AD) to meet an unmet medical need [1]. For Multiple Sclerosis (MS), there is a similar unmet medical need regarding tauopathy when MS transitions into the late, or Progressive MS that is currently incurable. AD and MS share commonality: there is comorbidity between AD and MS [2], and the recent awareness that progressive MS may be considered a secondary tauopathy [3]. This study lays the basic science foundation for a future repurposing of ASO tauopathy therapy from AD to MS. The central hypothesis is that in Progressive MS, tauopathy is not a passive bystander but an active contributor to synaptic degeneration through a novel toxic target known as DSI (Dendritic Syntaphilin Intrusion) discovered in our laboratory. In this hypothesis, the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2B activates Tau hyperphosphorylation (p-Tau), leading to the mislocalization or intrusion of a mitochondrial anchor SNPH into neuronal dendrites (DSI). This causes mitochondrial damage and subsequent synapse/dendrite disintegration. In support of this hypothesis that tauopathy is a key driver of DSI, we demonstrated using primary neuronal cultures that inhibitors of p-Tau kinases and Tau-KO both completely abolish DSI. We propose that a therapy for Progressive MS is repurpose the existing FDA-approved ASO Tau knockdown therapy from AD to treat MS.",

    "title": "Distortion rules: audibility creation in the mosquito ear",
    "content": "Hearing begins when ears convert sound into neuronal excitation. The hearing organs of male Anopheles mosquitoes rank amongst the most sensitive ears evolved. Males use them to detect faint female flight tones within noisy mating swarms, but female flight tones largely lie above the male's hearing range. We report a mechanism by which inaudible higher-frequency primary tones become audible through intrinsically generated, lower-frequency distortion tones. Distortion-evoked responses show ~10-times greater sensitivity and 45% higher temporal precision than those of same-frequency primary tones. Moreover, self-sustained oscillations of the male's ear dramatically reshape auditory frequency tuning and neuronal recruitment. By one mechanism, mosquito ears thus create audible signals and isolate these from the most salient frequencies of background noise. In audiology, distortions are used for diagnostics; their biological relevance, however, is unknown. Our results suggest that distortions are not mere by-products of the auditory process, but integral to its signaling logic.",

    "title": "The enhancement of nodal properties in the dorsal visual pathway is associated with compensatory mechanisms of visuospatial cognitive abilities following total sleep deprivation",
    "content": "IntroductionVision is the most critical sensory perception in humans, however, total sleep deprivation (TSD) impairs visuospatial cognitive abilities. While evidence suggests that the brain actively counteracts the adverse effects of TSD to preserve visual cognition, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood.MethodsTo explore the compensatory mechanisms of TSD on visuospatial cognition, we collected resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 24 participants at baseline state (BS) and after 36 h of TSD, along with behavioral data from a mental rotation task. Graph theory-based analyses were employed to assess global and nodal network properties.ResultsBehaviorally, reaction time (RT) significantly increased under TSD compared to BS, indicating impaired spatial cognition. In contrast, accuracy (ACC) for mirrored 120\u00b0 trials significantly improved under TSD, suggesting that participants invested greater effort in more demanding tasks and adopted a strategy of prolonged RT to maintain ACC. EEG findings revealed a significant increase in the small-worldness index (sigma) after TSD, which positively correlated with the improvement in ACC for mirrored 120\u00b0 trials. Nodal properties in the dorsal visual pathway, particularly in parietal regions, were significantly enhanced following TSD. Similarly, nodal properties in the left middle frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus were significantly strengthened, and these enhancements were positively associated with the increase of ACC in mirrored 120\u00b0 trials.DiscussionThese results demonstrate that individuals compensate for TSD-induced visual cognitive deficits by enhancing small-world network property and information transfer efficiency in the dorsal visual pathway. Additionally, top-down control is mediated by the middle frontal gyrus, while bottom-up information integration is facilitated by the superior temporal gyrus.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",
