We present RELATE-Sim, a theory-grounded simulator that models how couples behave at consequential turning points-exclusivity talks, conflict-and-repair episodes, relocations-rather than static traits. Two persona-aligned LLM agents (one per partner) interact under a centralized Scene Master that frames each turning point as a compact set of realistic options, advances the narrative, and infers interpretable state changes and an auditable commitment estimate after each scene. On a longitudinal dataset of 71 couples with two-year follow-ups, simulation-aware predictions outperform a personas-only baseline while surfacing actionable markers (e.g., repair attempts acknowledged, clarity shifts) that explain why trajectories diverge. RELATE-Sim pushes the relationship research's focus from matchmaking to maintenance, providing a transparent, extensible platform for understanding and forecasting long-term relationship dynamics.",

While many approaches leverage AR to guide motion, existing design guidelines focus on simple, upper-body movements within the user's field of view. We lack evidence-based design recommendations for guiding more diverse scenarios involving movements with varying levels of visibility and direction. We conducted an experiment to investigate how different visual encodings and perspectives affect motion guidance performance and usability, using three exercises that varied in visibility and planes of motion. Our findings reveal significant differences in preference and performance across designs. Notably, the best perspective varied depending on motion visibility and showing more information about the overall motion did not necessarily improve motion execution. We provide empirically-grounded guidelines for designing immersive, interactive visualizations for motion guidance to support more effective AR systems.",

However, the task of verifying the actual content of these attributions is in most cases impractical. In this paper, we present attribution gradients as a solution. Attribution gradients provide integrated, incremental affordances for diving into an attributed passage. A user can decompose a sentence of an answer into its claims. For each claim, the user can view supporting and contradictory excerpts mined from sources. Those excerpts serve as clickable conduits into the source (in our application, scientific papers). When evidence itself contains more citations, the UI unpacks the evidence into excerpts from the cited sources. These features of attribution gradients facilitate concurrent interconnections among answer, claim, excerpt, and context. In a usability study, we observed greater engagement with sources and richer revision in a task where participants revised an attributed AI answer with attribution gradients and a baseline.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.00344v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Superstition and religious belief system have historically shaped human behavior, offering powerful psychological motivations and persuasive frameworks to guide actions. Inspired by Feng Shui -- an ancient Chinese superstition -- this paper proposes a pseudo-theoretical framework that integrates superstition-like heuristics into visualization design. Rather than seeking empirical truth, this framework leverages culturally resonant (superstitious) narratives and symbolic metaphors as persuasive tools to encourage desirable design practices, such as clarity, accessibility, and audience-centered thinking. We articulate a set of visualization designs into a Feng Shui compass, reframing empirical design principles and guidelines within an engaing mythology. We present how visualization design principles can be intepreted in Feng Shui narratives, discussing the potential of these metaphorical principles in reducing designer anxiety, fostering community norms, and enhancing the memorability and internalization of visualization design guidelines. Finally, we discuss Feng Shui visualization theory as a set of cognitive shortcuts that can exert persuasive power through playful, belief-like activities.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.00339v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a closed-loop \"base+delta\" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from 0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora (DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify \"prompt legibility,\" showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system maintainability.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.00266v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visualization research often centers on how visual representations generate insight, guide interpretation, or support decision-making. But in many real-world domains, visualizations do not stand out--they recede into the background, stabilized and trusted as part of the everyday infrastructure of work. This paper explores what it means to take such quiet roles seriously. Drawing on theoretical traditions from joint cognitive systems, naturalistic decision making, and infrastructure studies, I examine how visualization can become embedded in the rhythms of expert practice--less a site of intervention than a scaffold for attention, coordination, and judgment. I illustrate this reorientation with examples from mission control operations at NASA, where visualizations are deeply integrated but rarely interrogated. Rather than treat invisibility as a failure of design or innovation, I argue that visualization's infrastructural presence demands new concepts, methods, and critical sensibilities. The goal is not to diminish visualization's importance, but to broaden the field's theoretical repertoire--to recognize and support visualization-in-use even when it fades from view.",

There is growing interest in the development of AI-assistants that support meetings, such as by providing assistance with tasks or summarizing a discussion. The quality of this support depends on a model that understands the conversational dialogue. To evaluate this understanding, we introduce a dual-axis testing framework for diagnosing the AI agent's comprehension of spoken conversations about data. Using this framework, we designed a series of tests to evaluate understanding of a novel corpus of 72 spoken conversational dialogues about data visualizations. We examine diverse pipelines and model architectures, LLM vs VLM, and diverse input formats for visualizations (the chart image, its underlying source code, or a hybrid of both) to see how this affects model performance on our tests. Using our evaluation methods, we found that text-only input modalities achieved the best performance (96%) in understanding discussions of visualizations in online meetings.",

Traditional data sonification transforms data into sound by mapping it to different parameters such as pitch, volume, and duration. Often and regrettably, this mapping leaves behind melody, harmony, rhythm and other musical devices that compose the centuries-long persuasive and expressive power of music. What results is the occasional, unintentional sense of tinnitus and horror film-like impending doom caused by a disconnect between the semantics of data and sound. Through this work we ask, can the aestheticization of sonification through (classical) music theory make data simultaneously accessible, meaningful, and pleasing to one's ears?",

A physical object with a mediated reality visual change retains its original physical properties. However, it is perceived differently from the original when interacted with. We present such a mediated reality object, a stick with different lengths or a stick with a missing portion in the middle, to investigate how users perceive its weight and center of gravity. We conducted two user studies (N=10), each of which consisted of two substudies. We found that the length of mediated reality sticks influences the perceived weight. A longer stick is perceived as lighter, and vice versa. The stick with a missing portion tends to be recognized as one continuous stick. Thus, its weight and center of gravity (COG) remain the same. We formulated the relationship between inertia based on the reported COG and perceived weight in the context of dynamic touch.",

We conducted a real-world experiment in a commercial Robotaxi operation zone, where 33 participants repeatedly crossed an uncontrolled intersection with frequent Level-4 Robotaxi traffic. Participants completed the Pedestrian Behavior Questionnaire (PBQ), Pedestrian Receptivity Questionnaire for Fully AVs (PRQF), pre- and post-experiment Trust in AVs Scale, and Personal Innovativeness Scale (PIS). Results showed that trust in AVs significantly increased post-experiment, with the increase positively associated with the Interaction component of PRQF. Additionally, both the Positive and Error subscales of the PBQ significantly influenced trust change. This study reveals how trust forms in real-world pedestrian-AV encounters, offering insights beyond lab-based research by accounting for population heterogeneity.",

Addressing this gap, we present, 'Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net', a vision model aligned with human brain activity based on non-invasive EEG, demonstrating a significantly higher similarity to human brain representations. Our innovative image-to-brain multi-layer encoding framework advances human neural alignment by optimizing multiple model layers and enabling the model to efficiently learn and mimic the human brain's visual representational patterns across object categories and different modalities. Our findings suggest that ReAlnets better align artificial neural networks with human brain representations, making it more similar to human brain processing than traditional computer vision models, which takes an important step toward bridging the gap between artificial and human vision and achieving more brain-like artificial intelligence systems.",

While deep generative models have been successfully applied to study the activity of neuronal ensembles, their potential for learning single-neuron representations from calcium imaging fluorescence traces remains largely unexplored, and batch effects remain an important hurdle. To address this, we explore supervised variational autoencoder architectures that learn compact representations of individual neurons from fluorescent traces without relying on spike inference algorithms. We find that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, preserving biological variability while mitigating batch effects.

Leveraging this insight, we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible, open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of general-purpose EEG models.",

    "title": "Some Further Developments on a Neurobiologically-based Model for Color Sensations in Humans",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.01000v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: At HVEI-2012, I presented a neurobiologically-based model for trichromatic color sensations in humans, mapping the neural substrate for color sensations to V1-L4: the thalamic recipient layer of the primary visual cortex. In this paper, I propose that V1-L4 itself consists of three distinct sub-layers that directly correspond to the three primary color sensations: blue, red, and green. Furthermore, I apply this model to three aspects of color vision: the three-dimensional (3D) color solid, dichromatism, and ocular agnosticism. Regarding these aspects further: (1) 3D color solid: V1-L4 is known to exhibit a gradient of cell densities from its outermost layer (i.e., its pia side) to its innermost layer (i.e., its white matter side). Taken together with the proposition that the population size of a cell assembly directly corresponds with the magnitude of a color sensation, it can be inferred that the neurobiologically-based color solid is a tilted cuboid. (2) Chromatic color blindness: Using deuteranopia as an example, at the retinal level, M-cones are lost and replaced by L-cones. However, at the cortical level, deuteranopia manifests as a fusion of the two bottom layers of V1-L4. (3) Ocular agnosticism: Although color sensation is monocular, we normally are not aware of which eye we are seeing with. This visual phenomenon can be explained by the nature of ocular integration within V1-L4. A neurobiologically-based model for human color sensations could significantly contribute to future engineering efforts aimed at enhancing human color experiences.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.00764v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mismatch negativity (MMN) in humans reflects deviance detection (DD), a core neural mechanism of predictive processing. However, the fundamental principles by which DD emerges and matures during early cortical development-potentially providing a neuronal scaffold for MMN-remain unclear. Here, we tracked the development of DD in dissociated cortical cultures grown on high-density CMOS microelectrode arrays from 10 to 35 days in vitro (DIV). Cultures were stimulated with oddball and many-standards control paradigms while spontaneous and evoked activity were recorded longitudinally. At early stages, stimulus-evoked responses were confined to fast components reflecting direct activation. From DIV15-20 onward, robust late responses appeared, and deviant stimuli progressively evoked stronger responses than frequent and control stimuli, marking the onset of DD. By DIV30, responses became stronger, faster, and more temporally precise. Neuronal avalanche analysis revealed a gradual transition from subcritical to near-critical dynamics, with cultures exhibiting power-law statistics showing the strongest deviant responses. Nonetheless, DD was also present in non-critical networks, indicating that criticality is not required for its emergence but instead stabilizes and amplifies predictive processing as networks mature. Early oddball experience reinforces the deviant pathway, resulting in faster conduction along those circuits. However, as frequent and deviant pathways become less distinct, the deviance detection index is reduced. Together, these findings demonstrate that DD arises intrinsically through local circuit maturation, while self-organization toward criticality and early experience further refine its strength and timing, providing mechanistic insight into predictive coding in simplified cortical networks and informing the design of adaptive, prediction-sensitive artificial systems.",

    "title": "Emergence of robust looming selectivity via coordinated inhibitory neural computations",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.00498v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the locust's lobula giant movement detector neural pathways, four categories of inhibition, i.e., global inhibition, self-inhibition, lateral inhibition, and feed-forward inhibition, have been functionally explored in the context of looming perception. However, their combined influence on shaping selectivity to looming motion remains unclear. Driven by recent physiological advancements, this paper offers new insights into the roles of these inhibitory mechanisms at multiple levels and scales in simulations, refining the specific selectivity for responding only to objects approaching the eyes while remaining unresponsive to other forms of movement. Within a feed-forward, multi-layer neural network framework, global inhibition, lateral inhibition, self-inhibition, and feed-forward inhibition are integrated. Global inhibition acts as an immediate feedback mechanism, normalising light intensities delivered by ommatidia, particularly addressing low-contrast looming. Self-inhibition, modelled numerically for the first time, suppresses translational motion. Lateral inhibition is formed by delayed local excitation spreading across a larger area. Notably, self-inhibition and lateral inhibition are sequential in time and are combined through feed-forward inhibition, which indicates the angular size subtended by moving objects. Together, these inhibitory processes attenuate motion-induced excitation at multiple levels and scales. This research suggests that self-inhibition may act earlier than lateral inhibition to rapidly reduce excitation in situ, thereby suppressing translational motion, and global inhibition can modulate excitation on a finer scale, enhancing selectivity in higher contrast range.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.00423v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neural synchronization is central to cognition However, incomplete synchronization often produces chimera states where coherent and incoherent dynamics coexist. While previous studies have explored such patterns using networks of coupled oscillators, it remains unclear why neurons commit to communication or how chimera states persist. Here, we investigate the coevolution of neuronal phases and communication strategies on directed, weighted networks, where interaction payoffs depend on phase alignment and may be asymmetric due to unilateral communication. We find that both connection weights and directionality influence the stability of communicative strategies -- and, consequently, full synchronization -- as well as the strategic nature of neuronal interactions. Applying our framework to the C. elegans connectome, we show that emergent payoff structures, such as the snowdrift game, underpin the formation of chimera states. Our computational results demonstrate a promising neurogame-theoretic perspective, leveraging evolutionary graph theory to shed light on mechanisms of neuronal coordination beyond classical synchronization models.",

Delay-coordinate embedding provides the theoretical basis but assumes long, noise-free recordings, which many domains violate. In neuroimaging, for example, fMRI is short and noisy; low sampling and strong red noise obscure oscillations and destabilize embeddings. We propose bootstrap Monte Carlo SSA with a red-noise null and bootstrap stability to retain only oscillatory modes that reproducibly exceed noise. This produces reconstructions that are red-noise-robust and mode-robust, enhancing determinism and stabilizing subsequent embeddings. Our results show that BMC-SSA improves the reliability of functional measures and uncovers differences in state-space dynamics in fMRI, offering a general framework for robust embeddings of noisy, finite signals.",

We present a hybrid neuron model combining the biophysical fidelity of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) dynamics for taste receptor cells with the computational efficiency of Izhikevich spiking neurons for large-network simulations. Our framework incorporates biomorphic taste cell models, featuring modality-specific receptor dynamics (T1R/T2R, ENaC, PKD) and Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK)-driven ion currents to accurately simulate gustatory transduction. Synaptic interactions are modeled via glutamate release kinetics with alpha-function profiles, AMPA receptor trafficking regulated by phosphorylation, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to enforce temporal coding. At the network level, we optimize multiscale learning, leveraging both temporal spike synchrony (van Rossum metrics) and combinatorial population coding (rank-order patterns). This approach bridges single-cell biophysics with ensemble-level computation, enabling efficient simulation of gustatory pathways while retaining biological fidelity.",

    "title": "Comparison of the reticulospinal drive to lumbar erector spinae muscles in postural and voluntary tasks using the StartReact paradigm",
    "content": "IntroductionWhile lesion and neurophysiological animal studies point toward a notable involvement of subcortical pathways in the control of low back muscles, little attention has been dedicated to the subject in humans. The StartReact paradigm may allow to indirectly test the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system during motor control, thus addressing this gap of knowledge. In this study, we aimed to compare the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system in the control of low back muscles during voluntary (lumbar spine extension) and postural (upper limb movement eliciting anticipatory postural adjustment) tasks using the StartReact paradigm.MethodsThe reaction time (RT) of the lumbar erector spinae was measured within a simple precued RT task while conditioned by startling (SAS\u2014116\u202fdB) or non-startling (NSAS\u201480\u202fdB) acoustic stimuli.ResultsThe reduction in RT was similar during the postural and voluntary tasks. However, RT was more shortened with the SAS condition compared to the NSAS condition in both tasks. This finding was replicated using a cumulative distribution functions analysis.DiscussionFor the first time, a StartReact effect of back muscles was demonstrated during a voluntary task and was shown to be similar to that observed in a postural task. Therefore, these results suggest a contribution of the reticulospinal tract in the postural and voluntary control of back muscles in humans.",

    "title": "Association between neuroticism and physical activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysical activity has been shown to be associated with neuroticism, a personality trait reflecting emotional instability and a tendency toward negative emotions. Understanding this relationship is crucial for developing effective mental health interventions. However, the underlying mechanisms and the strength of this association remain insufficiently understood.ObjectiveThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the current research on the relationship between neuroticism and physical activity, analyze their correlations and moderating factors, and investigate the potential bidirectional mechanisms linking these two factors.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost for studies published between January 2000 and November 2024. We included English-language studies across all age groups that employed cross-sectional, longitudinal, or cohort designs. Studies focusing on special populations, non-peer-reviewed works, samples with fewer than 50 participants, non-empirical studies, and reviews were excluded. Data extraction was performed using standardized forms, and a meta-analysis was conducted in Stata 18 to assess heterogeneity and publication bias.ResultsAfter screening, 25 studies were included, comprising 15 Pearson correlation analyses and 12 multiple regression analyses. The meta-analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between physical activity and neuroticism, with an average correlation coefficient r = \u22120.141. This suggests that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower levels of neuroticism. Specifically, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for neuroticism inhibiting physical activity was \u22120.150, indicating that for every one standard deviation increase in neuroticism, physical activity decreases by approximately 0.150 standard deviation units. Conversely, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for physical activity affecting neuroticism was \u22120.113, suggesting a potential reduction in neuroticism with increased physical activity, although this effect was not statistically significant across the limited number of studies.ConclusionOur findings confirm a significant negative association between physical activity and neuroticism, highlighting the potential of physical activity as a strategy for improving mental health. However, establishing causality requires further verification through longitudinal and experimental designs. The results emphasize the need for personalized interventions targeting individuals with high neuroticism. Future research should prioritize diverse cultural samples, standardized measurement protocols, and mechanistic investigations of this bidirectional relationship to better understand the underlying processes and develop effective interventions.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251051360, identifier: CRD420251051360.",

    "title": "Case Report: Implementation of stereoelectroencephalography in Kazakhstan: early experience in surgical planning for drug-resistant epilepsy",
    "content": "IntroductionThis clinical report describes the management of a 32-year-old patient with a long-standing history of drug-resistant epilepsy. It uniquely illustrates how stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) played a significant role in the presurgical evaluation of a multifocal epileptic disorder which, despite a long history of no changes on MRI, was ultimately found to be associated with bilateral hippocampal sclerosis. This is one of the first documented cases of SEEG application in Kazakhstan, where the method was introduced in 2024.Clinical presentation and diagnostic findingsThe patient suffered from debilitating seizures (4\u20136 times/week, often in series of 3-4/day) refractory to combined antiepileptic therapy. Scalp EEG revealed the first originating from the right frontotemporal leads with subsequent diffuse, predominantly right-sided, propagation. The second seizure, however, showed onset from the left temporal leads; notably, only left-onset seizures culminated in bilateral synchronization. Financial constraints precluding PET-CT and the diagnostic ambiguity of routine methods necessitated invasive SEEG.SEEG results and therapeutic strategySEEG monitoring unequivocally identified three independent epileptogenic foci: in the right hippocampus, left hippocampus, and left orbitofrontal region. Such multifocal pathology significantly reduces the likelihood of successful focal resection. Despite this inherent complexity, a crucial clinical outcome was achieved: the patient has remained completely seizure-free for 7\u202fmonths following the ANT-DBS procedure.ConclusionThis report underscores the critical role of SEEG in the precise localization and characterization of complex, multifocal epileptogenic networks, often elusive to non-invasive modalities. It convincingly demonstrates that a comprehensive invasive approach can lead to successful seizure control even in cases previously considered inoperable. It also reflects the challenges and advancements in developing high-tech epileptological care in regions where advanced methods like SEEG have only recently been introduced.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

By adopting a culturally responsive stance, CRD guides dream discussions without imposing psychological beliefs, acknowledging that many clients view dreams as meaningful cultural, religious, and spiritual experiences. Within CRD is a framework of key areas of focus: sharing, appreciating, finding the significance, and editing. Recognition of these four areas allows therapists to adaptively facilitate dream discussions using their core helping skills and multicultural competence, enabling dreamwork congruent with clients\u2019 beliefs and therapists\u2019 clinical approaches. The article details the need for CRD and its use in therapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Previous research and theory have identified several dispositions for experiencing frequent nightmares, but these dispositions are rarely examined simultaneously. This study compared the relative strength of these dispositions in predicting nightmare frequency. A sample of 116 university students completed measures of nightmare frequency, neuroticism, nightmare proneness, thin psychological boundaries, and sensory processing sensitivity. After accounting for sociodemographic variables and dream recall frequency, only nightmare proneness and thin boundaries significantly independently predicted nightmare frequency. These findings highlight the importance of nightmare proneness and thin boundaries as predictors, underscoring the need for further research with diverse samples to better understand these relationships. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War have profoundly affected individuals worldwide, eliciting heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and fear. This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

    "content": "Dreams are known to be affected by large-scale traumatic events that impact society, but the literature on social movement-related trauma is inadequate. The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Anti-ELAB) was a 7-month large-scale and highly traumatic social movement in Hong Kong that began in March 2019 in opposition to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government to amend its extradition laws. Using a sample of 112 Chinese young adult (74 females, 38 males, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.83) residents in Hong Kong, this article reports an investigation into relationships between trauma (as manifested in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), dream content (dream motifs, classified according to persecution or ego ideal delusional inclinations), and nightmare distress, all recalled by participants in relation to personal experiences of the Anti-ELAB. The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay. Potential explanations for the findings as well as their implications for further research and clinical practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Toward accurate single image sand dust removal by utilizing uncertainty-aware neural network",
    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

But, the GPU memory footprint during training is not effectively reduced in PETL. This issue happens because trainable parameters from these methods are generally tightly entangled with the backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored for back...",

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "Effects of combined prenatal exposure to air pollution and maternal stress on immune and dopaminergic gene expression in the gut-brain axis",
    "content": "Air pollution and maternal stress during pregnancy are both risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders and often converge on the same communities. Epidemiological and animal studies suggest that maternal psychosocial stress may worsen the effects of air pollutants on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Previous work utilizing a mouse model of combined prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and maternal stress (MS) has found numerous sex-specific effects of DEP/MS exposure on neuroimmune outcomes, dopamine receptors, the gut-brain axis, and social behavior. However, it is unclear how broadly the immune landscape is shifted in the brain and intestinal epithelium following DEP/MS. Here, we analyzed immune gene expression in 5 brain regions important for social behavior and in 3 regions of the intestinal epithelium in both male and female offspring following either DEP/MS or control exposure. We found several interesting overall patterns. First, changes in expression of immune genes such as CD11b and Tlr4 were concentrated in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. Tlr4 and Il-17ra mRNA also increased in the jejunum and colon following DEP/MS, but only in females. Second, in the nucleus accumbens, catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (Comt) and dopamine transporter 1 (Slc6a3) gene expression were increased following DEP/MS indicating increased dopamine degradation at and reuptake from the synapse, respectively. Additionally, Drd2 mRNA was decreased following DEP/MS in males. Finally, we observed numerous sex differences in immune gene expression regardless of treatment in both the brain and gut. Together, these findings suggest the nucleus accumbens is a key site for neuroimmune and dopaminergic changes following DEP/MS exposure and indicate persistent female-specific changes in intestinal immunity following these prenatal exposures.",

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "The cost of finetuning a pretrained model on downstream tasks steadily increases as they grow larger. Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is proposed to reduce this cost by changing only a tiny subset of trainable parameters. But, the GPU memory footprint during training is not effectively reduced in PETL. This issue happens because trainable parameters from these methods are generally tightly entangled with the backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored for back...",

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
    "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "content": "ObjectivesNight-shift work is associated with cognitive impairments, but convenient, effective, and acceptable traditional Chinese medicine-based interventions remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of auricular acupressure combined with auricular acupoint massage on cognitive function in night-shift nurses, using P300 wave parameters from electroencephalography analysis as objective metrics.MethodsEighty nurses (40 days-shift, 40 night-shift) participated. The intervention included auricular acupressure and massage targeting six points, performed daily for 4 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). P300 amplitude and latency were measured.ResultsNight-shift nurses had significantly higher ISI scores and lower MoCA attention, memory, and total scores compared to day-shift nurses (all p < 0.05). Before the intervention, After FDR correction for multiple comparisons, P300 amplitude was significantly lower at the T4 electrode site (q = 0.020) in the night-shift group. P300 latency remained significantly prolonged at sites Fz (q = 0.020), F3 (q < 0.001), F4 (q = 0.035), and T5 (q = 0.033). Post-intervention, the night-shift group demonstrated significant increases in P300 amplitude at F3, F4, T3, T4, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05) and significant reductions in P300 latency at Fz, F4, F7, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05). Notably, several sites with affected P300 amplitude and latency before the intervention showed significant improvement following intervention.ConclusionAuricular acupressure and massage significantly improved cognitive function in night-shift nurses, evidenced by enhanced P300 parameters. This non-invasive, cost-effective intervention shows promise for alleviating cognitive impairments from shift work.",

Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "title": "Computational modelling of novelty detection in the mismatch negativity protocols and its impairments in schizophrenia",
    "content": "The human auditory system rapidly distinguishes between novel and familiar sounds, a process reflected in mismatch neg- ativity (MMN), an EEG-based biomarker of auditory novelty detection. MMN is impaired in psychiatric conditions, most notably schizophrenia (SCZ), yet the neuronal mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Here, we combined com- putational modelling and genetic analyses to investigate how SCZ-associated cellular abnormalities affect auditory novelty detection. We developed an integrate-and-fire spiking network model capable of detecting four types of auditory novelty, including stimulus omission. Based on assumptions of short-term depressing synapses between the subpopulations of the net- work and the existence of neuronal inputs that are phase-locked to the rhythm of the recently experienced stimulus sequence, the model reliably reproduced MMN-like novelty detection and allowed systematic testing of SCZ-related cellular alterations. Simulations revealed that both reduced pyramidal cell excitability, linked to ion-channel dysfunction, and decreased spine density impaired novelty detection, with the latter producing stronger deficits. Our work provides a flexible spiking network model of auditory novelty detection that can link cellular-level abnormalities to measurable MMN deficits, improving their mechanistic interpretation and helping to explain the heterogeneity of SCZ.",

    "title": "Contralateral-Ipsilateral Segregation as a Conserved Principle of the Visual Corpus Callosum",
    "content": "How the corpus callosum (CC) integrates the left and right visual fields to create a unified perceptual experience is a fundamental unresolved question. It remains unresolved whether the CC transmits this information via segregated parallel channels or through mixed, integrated pathways. Here, we resolve this by creating a multimodal functional blueprint of the forceps major (FMA), the principal component of the visual callosum, in humans and mice. By combining ultra-high-field 7T fMRI with Bayesian population receptive field (pRF) modeling in humans, we directly test the competing hypotheses: segregated streams should manifest as voxels dominated by single pRFs, whereas integrated signals would produce voxels with multiple pRFs. Our results reveal a functionally segregated architecture dominated by single pRFs (expected probability 0.92), forming parallel streams that represent the contralateral (87.7%) and distinct ipsilateral (12.3%) visual field. In contrast, integrative dual pRFs are sparse and localized to the cortical boundary, reflecting the localized convergence of bilateral axons. This organizational principle is anatomically corroborated at the mesoscale in the mouse, where dual-color neuronal viral tracing and whole-brain light sheet microscopy imaging reveal a complementary laminar segregation of callosal fibers. Collectively, these findings establish that the visual callosum operates as a set of parallel, segregated information conduits, providing a new framework for understanding unified visual perception and for investigating callosal disruptions in neurological disorders.",

    "title": "Impact of Connectivity Granularity: A Comparison of ROI and Network-Level Approaches for Early Schizophrenia Classification",
    "content": "While schizophrenia diagnosis relies on clinical interviews, there is growing interest in neuroimaging-based computational tools to aid classification. In particular, resting-state fMRI-derived functional connectivity has been explored as a potential biomarker, with applications not only in supporting clinical assessment but also in research contexts such as patient stratification and probing disease mechanisms. Here, we compare two common approaches to computing functional connectivity - region of interest (ROI)-level and brain network-level - and evaluate their predictive power for classifying first-episode schizophrenia patients, in contrast to most prior work focusing on chronic patients. We show that ROI-level features consistently outperform network-level features. Despite the simplicity of our classification models, we achieved accuracies up to 83.15% using the AAL90 atlas. We also found that non-lagged functional connectivity generally outperforms lagged variants, suggesting that added temporal complexity may introduce noise rather than improve predictive power. Overall, our findings highlight region-based connectivity from a medium-resolution atlas as a promising representation for early-stage schizophrenia classification, while emphasising the need for validation on independent datasets to confirm generalisability.",

EPVS score (0\u20134) was evaluated on T2-weighted images on the basis of the number of EPVS in a single slice. DMV score (0\u201318) was assigned on susceptibility-weighted imaging according to signal continuity and clarity. Free water (FW) values, representing ISF content in white matter, were derived from diffusion tensor imaging.ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 63.6 \u00b1 11.1 years. The median score was as follows: BG-EPVS, 1 (IQR: 1\u20132); centrum semiovale EPVS (CSO-EPVS), 1 (IQR: 1\u20132); CSVD score, 1 (IQR: 0\u20132), and DMV, 4 (IQR: 1\u201311). The mean FW values were 0.25 \u00b1 0.02. No significant correlation was observed between CSO-EPVS and FW (r = 0.112, p = 0.119). In contrast, BG-EPVS showed a moderate positive correlation with both DMV score (r = 0.594, p < 0.001) and FW (r = 0.521, p < 0.001). DMV score was also moderate positively correlated with FW (r = 0.557, p < 0.001). These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk factors (all p < 0.05). Mediation analysis confirmed that DMV score significantly mediated the relationship between BG-EPVS and FW, independent of covariates.ConclusionHigher BG-EPVS score is significantly associated with increased ISF content in white matter, with DMV dysfunction serving as a key mediator of this association.",

    "title": "Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy",
    "content": "Objective. The anti-correlation between the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) is a stable characteristic of normal brain activity. However, in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), this anti-correlation is often disrupted and strongly associated with epileptic seizures. This study aims to use periodic spatiotemporal patterns (PSTP) analysis to elucidate the relationship between the DMN-TPN anti-correlation and epileptic activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying IGE. Approach. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyze PSTP in both healthy controls and IGE patients. A pattern-finding algorithm was initially applied to identify repeated spatiotemporal patterns, followed by a novel PSTP-finding algorithm to uncover dynamic periodic patterns through analysis of fluctuations in the DMN-TPN anti-correlation. The Hilbert transform was applied to capture the underlying basic states of these periodic patterns. Additionally, the relationship between period length and intrinsic neural timescales (INT) was explored. Main results. IGE patients exhibited a reduced DMN-TPN anti-correlation, particularly during TPN-dominant states. Additionally, IGE patients exhibited greater dynamic instability in basic states, marked by more frequent transitions between transitional states. Furthermore, lower correlations between period length and INT were observed in cognitive regions of IGE patients. Significance. These findings suggest that dynamic switching between the DMN and TPN in IGE is weaker and less balanced, with disruptions in periodic rhythms linked to cognitive impairments. The proposed PSTP framework provides new insights into the abnormal rhythms of IGE from a spatiotemporal perspective.",

    "title": "Amorphous silicon resistors enable smaller pixels in photovoltaic retinal prosthesis",
    "content": "Objective. Clinical trials of the photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis PRIMA demonstrated feasibility of prosthetic central vision with resolution matching its 100 \u00b5m pixel width. To improve prosthetic acuity further, pixel size should be decreased. However, there are multiple challenges, one of which is related to accommodating a compact shunt resistor within each pixel that discharges the electrodes between stimulation pulses and helps increase the contrast of the electric field pattern. Unfortunately, standard materials used in integrated circuit resistors do not match the resistivity required for small photovoltaic pixels. Therefore, we used a novel material\u2014doped amorphous silicon (a-Si) and integrated it into photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes down to 20 \u00b5m. Approach. To fit within a few \u00b5m2 area of the pixels and provide resistance in the M\u03a9 range, the material should have sheet resistance of a few 100 k\u03a9 sq\u22121, which translates to resistivity of a few \u03a9 * cm. The a-Si layer was deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and its resistivity was adjusted by PH3 doping before encapsulating the resistors between SiO2 and SiC for stability in-vivo. Main results. High-resolution retinal implants with integrated shunt resistors were fabricated with values ranging from 0.75 to 4 M\u03a9 on top of the photovoltaic pixels of 55, 40, 30 and 20 \u00b5m in size. Photoresponsivity with all pixel sizes was approximately 0.53 A W\u22121, as high as in the arrays with no shunt resistor. The shunts shortened electrodes discharge time, with the average electric potential in electrolyte decreasing by only 21%\u201331 % when repetition rate increased from 2 to 30 Hz, as opposed to a 54%\u201355 % decrease without a shunt. Similarly, contrast of a Landolt C pattern increased from 16%\u201322 % with no shunt to 22%\u201334 % with a shunt. Further improvement in contrast is expected with pillar electrodes and local returns within each pixel. Significance. Miniature shunt resistors in a M\u03a9 range can be fabricated from doped a-Si in a process compatible with manufacturing of photovoltaic arrays. The shunt resistors improved current injection and spatial contrast at video frame rates, without compromising the photoresponsivity. These advances are critical for scaling pixel sizes below 100\u202f\u00b5m to improve visual acuity of prosthetic vision.",

    "content": "Objective. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, encompassing a prodromal stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where patients may either progress to AD or remain stable. The objective of the work was to capture structural and functional modulations of brain structure and function relying on multimodal MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphisms, also in case of missing views, with the twofold goal of classifying AD patients versus healthy controls and detecting MCI converters. Approach. We propose a multimodal deep learning (DL)-based classification framework where a generative module employing cycle generative adversarial networks was introduced in the latent space for imputing missing data (a common issue of multimodal approaches). Explainable AI method was then used to extract input features\u2019 relevance allowing for post-hoc validation and enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. Main results. Experimental results on two tasks, AD detection and MCI conversion, showed that our framework reached competitive performance in the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of (CI [0.90, 0.95]) and (CI [0.70, 0.72]) in the two tasks, respectively. The interpretability analysis revealed gray matter modulations in cortical and subcortical brain areas typically associated with AD. Moreover, impairments in sensory-motor and visual resting state networks along the disease continuum, as well as genetic mutations defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified. Significance. Our integrative and interpretable DL approach shows promising performance for AD detection and MCI prediction while shedding light on important biological insights.",

However, conventional island designs encounter stress concentration issues caused by inherent modulus mismatches, critically limiting achievable island densities. This limitation forces a stubborn trade-off between strain-insensitivity and sensing resolution. Here, inspired by the entangled elastin networks...",

It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "title": "Autonomous retrieval for continuous learning in associative memory networks",
    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is proposed to reduce this cost by changing only a tiny subset of trainable parameters. But, the GPU memory footprint during training is not effectively reduced in PETL. This issue happens because trainable parameters from these methods are generally tightly entangled with the backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored for back...",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Using Python Asyncio and Aiohttp, it can handle bulk downloads, scaling to millions of panoramas per day.</p> <p>- Other solutions don\u2019t match up because they ignore edge cases, especially pre-2016 images with different resolutions. They used fixed width and height that only worked for post-2016 panoramas, which caused black spaces in older ones.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> </p> <p>&quot;For educational purposes only&quot; <strong><em>- just in case Google is watching.</em></strong> </p> <p>It was a fun project to work on, as there was no documentation whatsoever, whether by Google or other existing solutions. So, I documented the key points that explain why a panorama image looks the way it does based on the given inputs (mainly zoom levels).</p> <p>The way I was able to reverse engineer Google Maps Street View API was by sitting all day for a week, doing nothing but observing the results of the endpoint, testing inputs, assembling panoramas, observing outputs, and repeating. With no documentation, no lead, and no reference, it was all trial and error.</p> <p>I believe I have covered most edge cases, though I still doubt I may have missed some. Despite testing hundreds of panoramas at different inputs, I\u2019m sure there could be a case I didn\u2019t encounter.

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "title": "Disrupted Regional Dynamics of Structure-Function Connectivity Coupling in Euthymic Bipolar Disorder",
    "content": "Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by persistent disturbances in emotional regulation and cognitive function, even during euthymia, yet its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Given evidence of structural and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) abnormalities in BD, investigating dynamic structure-function connectivity coupling (SC-FC coupling) may provide insights into the pathophysiology of the disorder. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state fMRI data were collected from 61 euthymic BD-I patients and 54 healthy controls (HC). Structural connectivity was derived using probabilistic tractography, and dFC was estimated with a sliding-window approach. SC-FC coupling was quantified as the extent to which structural features predicted dFC using multivariate linear regression. Abnormal SC-FC coupling in BD was assessed at both the network and regional levels, relative to HC. Over time, SC-FC coupling was categorized into high- and low-coupling states, and dynamic state analyses of dwell time, occurrence rate, and transition probabilities were performed in the affected brain regions. Results: Network-level analyses indicated that BD exhibits lower SC-FC coupling in subcortical regions compared with HC. Regional analyses revealed significantly reduced dynamic SC-FC coupling in two thalamic subregions (medial posterior and rostral temporal) and in the right primary somatosensory cortex in BD compared to HC. Dynamic analyses further demonstrated thalamic instability: BD showed shorter dwell times in high-coupling states, increased occurrence of low-coupling states, and more frequent high-to-low coupling transitions than HC. These abnormalities suggest that BD is characterized by disrupted structure-function integration and unstable thalamocortical dynamics. Conclusion: Our findings reveal regional abnormalities in SC-FC coupling dynamics in BD, indicating persistent dysfunction of structure-function integration during euthymia. Dynamic coupling measures may provide preliminary insights into potential biomarkers for disease monitoring.",

    "title": "A validated set of neural gene reporter mice and chemical tracers tools for mapping knee innervating neurons",
    "content": "Joint pain is an increasing concern for our aging population, as current therapies to slow joint disease progression or reduce pain are largely ineffective and often carry significant health and dependency risks. Age and joint disease induce changes to all tissues that make up the joint, including the dense neural network that innervates the joint. Several studies have correlated some joint innervation changes in joint diseases such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, but little is known about their respective functional consequences. In general, knee innervating neurons are classified as either non/peptidergic nociceptive or sympathetic neurons. How subtypes of these neurons affect individual pain experience remains relatively uncharacterized. The few studies typically focused on a single neural subtype due to the limited availability of validated tools to study joint innervation1-5. To better understand the relationship between aging, joint disease, and pain, systematic characterization of pain nociceptors and other neural subtypes that regulate joint homeostasis and pain signaling is urgently needed. The objective of this study was to establish a validated molecular and genetic toolbox for accurate mapping of the neuroarchitecture in the murine knee. We screened a panel of genetic reporter mice, consisting of Cre and Flp recombinase driver mouse lines that activate recombinase responsive reporter alleles in either peripheral nociceptors or post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons, for their specificity and accuracy in labeling their respective neural subtype in the dorsal root ganglion and knee joint. In addition, we compared the performance of a series of conventional retrograde tracers for effective tracking of primary afferent sensory and post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons from the knee joint. The validated molecular and genetic tools identified in this study will facilitate the creation of comprehensive joint innervation maps in physiological and pathological contexts, setting the stage for identifying the cellular and molecular changes responsible for mediating joint pain, a necessary goal for improved therapeutic interventions.",

    "title": "Target engagement in human motor cortex induced by constant sinusoidal and amplitude-modulated transcranial AC stimulation",
    "content": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a noninvasive technique for modulating brain oscillations. While sinusoidal tACS (sin-tACS) delivers current at a constant amplitude, amplitude-modulated tACS (AM-tACS) uses a high-frequency carrier modulated by a low-frequency envelope. We systematically compared the acute effects of sin-tACS at theta (5 Hz), alpha (10 Hz), beta (20 Hz), and gamma (140 Hz) frequencies, and AM-tACS (140 Hz carrier frequency modulated at theta, alpha, or beta) on corticospinal excitability. Healthy participants received 2 mA peak-to-peak tACS to the primary motor hand area (M1HAND) via a bipolar montage (M1HAND-Pz). Each tACS block consisted of ten 30-second stimulation periods interleaved with 6-second pauses, followed by 11 minutes without stimulation. Corticospinal excitability was assessed during each block using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), delivered at the peak and trough of tACS. MEP amplitudes were generally larger at the trough. Only beta sin-tACS and theta AM-tACS significantly modulated corticospinal excitability. Beta sin-tACS increased MEP amplitudes in early stimulation epochs, while theta AM-tACS facilitated MEPs in later stimulation epochs and this facilitation persisted briefly after stimulation ended. Participants with stronger early responses to beta sin-tACS also tended to show greater delayed effects with theta AM-tACS. These excitability changes during tACS were not predicted by simulated electric field strength. A follow-up EEG experiment revealed that beta sin-tACS increased beta power over left sensorimotor cortex, while theta AM-tACS decreased beta power over midline parietal cortex. These EEG changes were restricted to tACS pauses. The results show that sin-tACS and AM-tACS can both modulate corticospinal excitability, but functional changes differ in temporal dynamics, frequency specificity, and cortical region engagement.",

    "title": "Hormonal contraceptive use is associated with reduced central serotonergic activity indexed by the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials",
    "content": "ObjectiveHormonal contraceptives (HCs) are linked to mood disturbances, but the neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated whether HC use is associated with altered central serotonergic activity, using the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP).MethodsFifty-four healthy women (30 current HC users and 24 non-users) completed EEG recordings to assess LDAEP. Depressive symptoms were quantified using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Between-group analyses were controlled for age and depressive symptoms, and effects of menstrual cycle phase, HC type, and mood-related side effects were also examined.ResultsHC users showed significantly steeper LDAEP slopes than non-users across components (all p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.028) consistent with reduced central serotonergic activity. This remained significant controlling for age and depressive symptoms. No significant effects of menstrual cycle phase or HC type, but HC users reporting adverse mood effects had more somatic symptoms, without corresponding LDAEP differences.ConclusionThis study is, to our knowledge, among the first to explicitly test an a priori hypothesis that HC use is associated with reduced serotonergic activity indexed by LDAEP in healthy women, and shows that HC use is linked to attenuated central serotonergic activity independent of mood symptoms. These findings underscore the role of sex hormones in shaping serotonergic function and may explain individual variability in mood and antidepressant response.",

    "title": "Personalized whole-brain models of seizure propagation",
    "content": "Objective. Computational modeling has recently emerged as a powerful tool to better understand seizure dynamics and guide new treatment strategies. This work aims to develop and personalize whole-brain computational models in epilepsy using multimodal clinical data to simulate and evaluate individualized therapeutic strategies. Approach. We present a computational framework that constructs patient-specific whole-brain models of seizure propagation by integrating SEEG, MRI, and diffusion MRI data. The pipeline uses neural mass models for each node in the network, simulating whole-brain dynamics. Model personalization involves adjusting global and local parameters representing the excitability of individual brain areas, using an evolutionary algorithm that aims to maximize the correlation between empirical and synthetic functional connectivity matrices derived from SEEG data. Main results. The resulting personalized models successfully reproduce individual seizure propagation patterns and can be used to simulate therapeutic interventions like surgery, stimulation, or pharmacological interventions within a unified physiological framework. Notably, model predictions reveal distinct patient-specific responses across interventions, including variable sensitivity to different pharmacological agents and identification of critical regions whose removal or modulation reduced seizure spread. Significance. This framework provides a mechanistic, interpretable approach to simulate and compare individualized treatment strategies. By integrating multimodal data into a unified whole-brain model, it has the potential to improve clinical decision-making in epilepsy by identifying accessible and functionally relevant targets.",

Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is proposed to reduce this cost by changing only a tiny subset of trainable parameters. But, the GPU memory footprint during training is not effectively reduced in PETL. This issue happens because trainable parameters from these methods are generally tightly entangled with the backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored for back...",

    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder.

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Anomalous experiences are associated with high subconscious connectedness.",
    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

    "title": "An Emergentist Account of Language in the Brain\u2014Seeking Neural Synergies Behind Human Uniqueness",
    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

    "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "On carrier frequency in transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation: a narrative review",
    "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) using kilohertz frequency carrier modulation has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach to improve motor recovery and reduce pain. Early application of 5\u201310 kHz modulated pulses for tSCS has shown promising results in spinal cord (SC) injury and post-stroke rehabilitation, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. Approach. This narrative review synthesizes electrophysiological, computational and clinical evidence to assess how kilohertz modulation influences spinal and corticospinal excitability and analgesia. A total of 20 preclinical and clinical studies comparing the effects of kHz-modulated and conventional stimulation pulses were reviewed. Main results. The results indicate that kilohertz modulated tSCS increases tolerance to stimulation, but requires a higher charge to evoke motor responses in healthy participants and individuals with post-stroke motor disorder. Compared to conventional stimulation, modulated stimulation recruits afferents less efficiently at motor threshold intensity but appears to engage broader corticospinal circuits, especially near or below threshold. Frequency-specific effects include prolonged spinal inhibition, frequency-dependent modulation of supraspinal input, and selective activation of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. Computational study supports these observations, showing that kilohertz pulses produce delayed action potential initiation due to alternating depolarization cycles. A comparative functional study has shown that modulated tSCS improves motor function in individuals with SC injury more significantly than conventional stimulation. Significance. This narrative review highlights gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of modulated tSCS, suggests directions for further research and will be useful in planning studies on the mechanisms behind tSCS with and without carrier frequency. It also holds engineering relevance for the optimal design of stimulation devices.",

    "title": "Helical neural implants for intracerebral drug delivery",
    "content": "Objective. Neurological disorders often arise from specific regions of dysfunction in the brain. One approach to target these pathologic regions is through chemical delivery using intracerebral implants. Previous works have designed implants that are small and flexible, minimizing the mechanical mismatch between inorganic implants and soft organic brain tissue. Most of these implants are simple cylindrical catheters with inflow and outflow ports at either end of the cylinder. This limits the region and volume of tissue that can be dosed. We sought to develop novel catheter designs that permit targeting of larger volumes of brain tissue while maintaining minimal footprint to minimize gliosis. Approach. We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel helical-shaped microfluidic catheter we term SPIRAL (Strategic Precision Infusion for Regional Administration of Liquid). SPIRAL leverages rational fluidic design of multiple fluid outflow ports to vary infused fluid spatial distribution across brain regions. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models to test the fluid dynamic functionality and chronic viability of SPIRAL. Results. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) models illustrate how SPIRAL can be configured to permit simultaneous dosing through multiple outflow ports yielding a variable fluid distribution compared to a straight catheter. We show how CFD in silico models can be used to optimize dimensions of channel openings across SPIRAL, to achieve uniform flow through channels and validate these results in vitro. We show how chronically implanted SPIRAL catheters do not increase gliosis compared to standard straight catheters of similar dimensions or materials. Significance. Our helical intracerebral drug delivery catheter facilitates fluid localization while maintaining minimal invasiveness. SPIRAL could enable multiregional brain access and improve therapeutic efforts in the treatment of neurological diseases.",

However, research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy of acceptance, which may be related to instructions to accept different aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., thoughts vs. emotion). We compared the effects of self-regulation instructions to accept thoughts, emotions, or a combination of both on measures of affect (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, state anxiety) and emotional dysregulation immediately following emotion-eliciting film clips and following recovery periods after film clips. We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip. Implications of findings and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134.

The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "title": "Menstrual cycle phase alters corticospinal excitability and spike-timing-dependent plasticity in healthy females",
    "content": "The known fluctuations in ovarian hormone concentrations across the eumenorrheic menstrual cycle contribute to modulations in cortical excitability and inhibition. However, how such changes affect spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has not been systematically studied. This research aimed to determine the effect of the menstrual cycle on corticospinal excitability and STDP. Twelve eumenorrheic female participants (age: 25 {+/-} 5 years), visited the lab in three menstrual cycle phases: early follicular (EF), late follicular (LF), and mid-luteal (ML). Visits comprised of corticospinal excitability (motor evoked potential [MEP]/Mmax), short-intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) measures, recorded in the resting first dorsal interosseous. Followed by a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, utilising ulnar nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation (25 ms interstimulus interval) to elicit neuroplasticity. To assess the time course of STDP, measurements were repeated at 15 and 30-minutes post PAS. Corticospinal excitability (MEP/Mmax) was greater in the LF phase (p [&le;]0.002) compared to EF and ML, with no phase effects observed for SICI or ICF (p[&ge;]0.112). PAS elicited an increase in MEP/Mmax across all phases at 15-minutes (112 {+/-} 5, 115 {+/-} 5, and 113 {+/-} 7% baseline, p[&le;]0.010), whereas at 30-minutes only ML was facilitated (126 {+/-} 7% baseline, p=0.029). The present data demonstrates facilitatory STDP can be induced with PAS across the tested menstrual cycle phases, but responses are prolonged and potentiated in the ML phase. Additionally, increased corticospinal excitability in the LF phase is likely due to intrinsic changes within the descending tract, as no changes in intracortical neurotransmission were observed.",

    "title": "Exploring Single-Cell Gene Regulatory Dynamics in Rett Syndrome",
    "content": "Rett syndrome is a monogenic disorder with an incidence of 95% in women, characterized by the complexity of studying the associated phenotype due to the heterogeneity in patient tissues from the stochastic silencing of the affected X chromosome. Furthermore, we are largely unaware of the cascade of alterations that occur in neurons due to transcriptional changes induced by the affected MECP2 gene. To address these challenges, an in-depth network analysis was implemented using organoid single-cell transcriptomic data derived from human patients. We performed a Weighted correlation network analysis and trajectory analysis to understand the differences in the developmental processes between samples, we followed by the generation of gene regulatory networks for each relevant cell developmental pathways to assess the master regulator that are involved in this process with potential therapeutic implications which we identified by integration with SFARI and Genes4Epi. The results were adapted into dynamic Boolean models from fitted with the transcriptomic data for validation in which we evaluated the attractor field from each reachable state . These approaches allowed us to explore differences in regulatory behavior in the developmental pathways. Our study provides an insight that pinpoints the cellular stages on which the regulation and compensatory mechanism activate and regulate Rett syndrome. We identified 19 Master regulators for the Dopaminergic developmental trajectory, as well as 34 Master regulator genes for the Gabaergic developmental trajectory. Dynamic Boolean modeling of this systems showcased a comprehensive understanding of the disrupted developmental pathways of Rett syndrome, highlighting the transitional states of potential within maturation trajectories as the key point of divergence in regulation for Rett syndrome. After complementing with enrichment and clinical relevant variant analysis, we identify the key actors in this system as NR2F1 and TCF4, with TCF4 suggesting a symmetrical compensatory relationship with MeCP2, and NR2F1 as possible link with wider developmental conditions, this concluded with highlighting the possibility of regulation in this condition being affected by the MAPK-ERK pathway of transcriptional regulation in this condition being affected by the MAPK-ERK pathway of transcriptional regulation, offering a novel angle for targeted research.",

    "title": "Cerebral Bases and Neural Dynamics of Audiovisual Temporal Binding Window: a TMS study",
    "content": "The temporal binding window (TBW) refers to the time interval within which two stimuli, typically visual and auditory, are perceived as synchronous. Neural bases underlying this process consistently implicate a large-scale network with superior temporal sulcus (STS) as a central hub, alongside contributions from primary auditory and visual cortices and higher-order areas including prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex. This study aimed to provide causal evidence for the involvement of superior temporal gyrus (STG) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in the simultaneity judgment (SJ) task using MRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In particular, we aimed to clarify temporal dynamics of these regions in audiovisual synchrony perception. Forty adults performed an SJ task in which they had to determine whether stimuli were synchronous or asynchronous. Single-pulse TMS was applied over bilateral IPS, STG, or the vertex at different delays following stimulus offset. Early stimulation of left IPS and right STG increased the proportion of \"synchronous\" responses. In contrast, later stimulation of bilateral STG was associated with reduced synchrony perception. These findings provide causal evidence for a dynamic interplay between parietal and temporal regions in audiovisual temporal integration. Early IPS and STG involvement facilitates temporal integration, while later STG activity promotes perceptual segregation.",

    "content": "<p>The basal forebrain (BF) acts as a pivotal relay station in the transmission of arousal signals, projecting to both cortical and subcortical structures. Among its downstream targets is the lateral habenula (LHb), which recent research has implicated in the modulation of sleep rhythms and in mediating the loss of consciousness associated with anesthetic agents. In our study, we utilized optogenetic manipulation to selectively modulate the BF<sup>VGluT2/SOM</sup> neuron projection pathway to the LHb, thereby examining its impact on behavioral and electroencephalographic responses to isoflurane anesthesia. Our results demonstrated that in healthy adult male mice, the activation of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway significantly prolonged the induction time of anesthesia and shortened recovery time, consequently diminishing the anesthetic potency of isoflurane and reducing EEG <i></i> power. In contrast, the inhibition of this pathway yielded the inverse effects. Notably, modulation of the BF<sup>VGluT2</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway did not significantly affect the induction or recovery times of isoflurane anesthesia. Employing optogenetics in conjunction with calcium signal recording, we elucidated that the arousing effect of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb pathway is attributable to the enhanced inhibitory action of BF<sup>SOM</sup> neurons on LHb<sup>Glu</sup> neurons. This discovery sheds new light on the neural circuits involved in the loss and recovery of consciousness induced by anesthetic drugs, potentially informing future therapeutic strategies.</p>",

    "title": "Stopping Muscle Contractions and Relaxations during Action Inhibition Involves Global and Targeted Control Dependent on Muscle State",
    "content": "<p>The mechanisms underpinning the stopping of muscle contractions and relaxations during action inhibition remain unclear. Central stop commands may be targeted and act on task-active muscles only, or instead be global, acting on task-passive muscles as well. We addressed this question in three stop signal task experiments with human participants (<i>n</i> = 54; 18 male, 36 female). While maintaining baseline force levels (10% MVC) in both index fingers, Go signals required participants to increase or decrease this force in the task-active finger (Task-active Contract vs Task-active Relax) while keeping activity in the task-passive muscle constant. On 30% of trials, delayed stop signals instructed participants to stop the task-active responses. Stop-related activity was detected in task-active muscles at the single trial level, using electromyography (EMG), and used to determine whether stop-related activity was also present in task-passive muscles. We found that stop commands act on both task-active and task-passive muscles, suggesting global control. This global control was furthermore muscle state specific, by decreasing muscle activity when stopping contractions and increasing muscle activity when stopping relaxations. However, stopping muscle contractions involved more sustained suppression of muscle activity in task-active than task-passive muscles, suggesting additional targeted control. This was not the case when stopping muscle relaxations, which only showed evidence of global control. Our results may explain how complex, real-world actions are inhibited. Global stop commands that are sensitive to muscle state may rapidly adjust muscle activity across the body, with additional control targeted to contracting, task-active muscles.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Behavioral outcomes are rarely certain, requiring subjects to discriminate between available choices by using feedback to guide future decisions. Probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) tasks test subjects&rsquo; ability to learn and flexibly adapt to changes in reward contingencies. Cortico-striatal circuitry has been broadly implicated in flexible decision-making&mdash;though what role these circuits play remains complicated. In this study we leveraged the fast temporal dynamics of local field potentials to precisely identify the role that cortico-striatal networks play during PRL reward feedback. We measured widespread (32-CH) local field potential activity of male Long&ndash;Evans rats during a PRL task wherein a target response delivered reward on 80% of trials while a non-target response delivered reward on 20% of trials. When subjects learned those reward probabilities, contingencies were reversed. We found that reward-evoked oscillations at beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) and high gamma (&gt;70&nbsp;Hz) frequencies marked positive reward valence and reflected probability of reward. Activity and connectivity at beta frequencies between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum during expected rewards were correlated with behavioral performance and specific aspects of value/exploitative behavior as defined by a reinforcement learning computational model. Finally, we found that modulating beta activity in orbitofrontal cortex with optogenetic (20&nbsp;Hz) stimulation promoted maladaptive behavior when stimulation was provided during non-target responses, consistent with our data and computational model predictions. Reward-evoked beta oscillations may reflect a crucial component underlying reward learning, and erroneous elevations in this physiological signal may contribute to maladaptive task performance and behavioral disruptions.</p>",

    "title": "Mechanisms of Long-Term Nonexternally Reinforced Preference Change: Functional Connectivity Changes in a Longitudinal Functional MRI Study",
    "content": "<p>Behavioral change studies mostly focus on external reinforcements to modify preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) is a paradigm that influences preferences by the mere association of stimuli, sensory cues, and a rapid motor response, without external reinforcements. The behavioral effect has been shown to last for months after less than 1&nbsp;h of training. Here, we used a modified version of CAT by changing the neutral-cue to a number that represented a monetary amount of reward that the participants accumulate (i.e., incentive-cue). After a single training session, we compared behavioral performance and functional connectivity (FC), as measured by resting-state scans using functional magnetic resonance imaging, between two groups (total of 107 males and females in both groups), one receiving a neutral-cue and the other receiving an incentive-cue, at five time points across 1&nbsp;year. We replicated the maintenance of behavioral changes after 6&nbsp;months for the nonexternally reinforced neutral-cue participants, but not for the reinforced group. The reinforced training group showed higher FC within the limbic system, whereas the nonexternally reinforced group showed higher functional connectivity within and between default mode and dorsal attention networks. Our findings offer putative neural correlates for both reinforced and nonexternally reinforced preference changes that are maintained over time and which could be implemented in future behavioral change interventions.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by mislocalization and aggregation of proteins in motor neurons. Ataxin-2 (ATXN2), an RNA-binding protein harboring 22-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats, is a risk factor for ALS, when its polyQ repeats are expanded to 27&ndash;33 repeats. However, the physiological function of ATXN2 beyond its role in RNA regulation and how polyQ expansion in ATXN2 increases risk for ALS remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that <i>Drosophila</i> Atx2 functions as a regulator of microtubule (MT) dynamics in motor neurons. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism underlying Atx2-mediated MT regulation and how polyQ expansion disrupts its function, using a mixed-sex population of <i>Drosophila</i> as a model system. Specifically, we show that Atx2 requires its RNA-binding Lsm domain to regulate MTs. Notably, the LSM domains of human ATXN2 rescue MT phenotype in <i>Drosophila</i>, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved role of ATXN2 in MT regulation. Importantly, we find that polyQ-expanded ATXN2 forms cytoplasmic aggregates and leads to excessive MT destabilization. Additionally, polyQ expansion severely impairs axon outgrowth. Finally, we identify uncoordinated-76 (UNC-76/FEZ1) as a downstream effector of Atx2 in MT regulation and neuronal development.</p>",

    "content": "<p>While cerebrovascular dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis are extensively characterized hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the dynamic relationship between reactive astrocytes and cerebral vessels remains poorly understood. Here, we used jGCaMP8f and two-photon microscopy to investigate calcium signaling in multiple astrocyte subcompartments, concurrent with changes in cerebral arteriole activity, in fully awake 7- to 8-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice, a model for AD-like pathology, and wild-type (WT) littermates. In the absence of movement, spontaneous calcium transients in barrel cortex occurred more frequently in astrocyte somata, processes, and perivascular regions of 5xFAD mice. However, evoked arteriole dilations (in response to air puff stimulation of contralateral whiskers) and concurrent calcium transients across astrocyte compartments were reduced in 5xFAD mice relative to WTs. Synchronous activity within multicell astrocyte networks was also impaired in the 5xFAD group. Using a custom application to assess functional coupling between astrocyte end feet and immediately adjacent arteriole segments, we detected deficits in calcium response probability in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, end feet calcium transients following arteriole dilations exhibited a slower onset, reduced amplitude, and lacked relative proportionality to vasomotive activity compared with WTs. The results reveal nuanced alterations in 5xFAD reactive astrocytes highlighted by impaired signaling fidelity between astrocyte end feet and cerebral arterioles. The results have important implications for the mechanistic underpinnings of brain hypometabolism and the disruption of neurophysiologic communication found in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The central amygdala (CeA) is an important neuronal hub that integrates external sensory inputs and information about internal states to regulate a range of innate and learned behaviors, including fear learning and memory. Prior studies, leveraging robust fear conditioning assays, have delineated detailed circuit mechanisms underlying the acquisition and recall of fear memories. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in the CeA remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the clock output molecule mWAKE/ANKFN1 within the CeA of male mice in fear learning and memory. mWAKE is expressed in multiple neuronal subclusters in the lateral CeA. Surprisingly, mWAKE levels do not exhibit rhythmic expression in the CeA. In line with this observation, expression of the core clock genes PER2 and BMAL also does not cycle in the CeA. Consistent with prior studies, loss of mWAKE function increases intrinsic excitability of CeA neurons. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of mWAKE and chemogenetic activation of CeA<sup>mWAKE</sup> neurons impair fear learning and memory. Finally, we show that mWAKE levels in a subset of CeA neurons are reduced following fear conditioning. These findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism modulating the activity and function of CeA neurons in fear learning and memory.</p>",

We examined how attention influences this automatic and implicit learning process in humans (male and female). Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which attention was oriented either toward or away from the visual feedback that defined the error signal. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of sensorimotor adaptation. Using dual-task methods, we next examined the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused and divided attention conditions. However, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. These results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.</p>",

    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "title": "Evaluating the efficacy of probiotics in treating Parkinson\u2019s disease model rats using magnetic resonance enhanced gradient echo T2-weighted angiography sequence",
    "content": "BackgroundParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) involves iron deposition in the substantia nigra (SN) and loss of dopaminergic neurons, with gut microbiota dysbiosis potentially affecting the brain iron via the gut\u2013brain axis, whereas magnetic resonance enhanced gradient echo T2-weighted angiography (ESWAN) enables non-invasive iron assessment. Currently, for the detection of brain iron content, traditional tissue biopsy can provide accurate pathological information. However, its clinical and scientific research applications are limited owing to its invasiveness, difficulty in repeated operations, and other limitations. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of probiotics and underlying mechanisms in PD rats using ESWAN.MethodsTwenty-seven male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were divided into control, PD model, and probiotic treatment groups. PD models were established by 6-hydroxydopamine stereotaxic injection into the SN, whereas the treatment group received oral gavage of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum mixture. ESWAN was used to quantify iron deposition, complemented by iron histochemical staining and wire grip tests for motor function assessment.ResultsThe probiotic treatment significantly reduced right SN R2* values (p < 0.0001) and iron staining optical density (p < 0.0001), and prolonged the time of wire grip duration (p < 0.0001) compared with PD rats, though not fully to control levels. Mechanistically, probiotics likely alleviated iron overload via gut\u2013brain axis modulation, antioxidant enzyme enhancement, and blood\u2013brain barrier maintenance. The strong positive correlation (r \u2265 0.7) between ESWAN-derived R2* values and iron staining confirmed ESWAN as a reliable non-invasive tool for brain iron assessment.ConclusionThis study provides experimental evidence that probiotics mitigate SN iron deposition in PD rats by regulating gut microbiota, highlighting ESWAN as a potential imaging biomarker for early PD diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.",

    "content": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has demonstrated promise both for treating diverse clinical conditions and for enhancing brain function in healthy adults. Despite increasing popularity, the precise physiological mechanisms underlying its effects remain poorly defined, contributing to inconsistent findings. This review synthesises current evidence for both acute and enduring effects of tDCS across the complete neurovascular unit, encompassing neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, the blood\u2013brain barrier, metabolic pathways, and immune responses. We review recent transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies which reveal that tDCS induces coordinated molecular changes, including modulation of genes involved in inflammation, neurogenesis, calcium signalling, mitochondrial metabolism, and synaptic plasticity proteins. We emphasise significant gaps in current literature, particularly the limited consideration given to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, despite their known importance in activity-dependent plasticity. We conclude that the neurovascular unit represents an integrative and complex target of tDCS, suggesting that comprehensive modulation of these components may better explain observed changes in cognitive, behavioural, and neuropsychological outcomes. Future research should move beyond a neuron-centric perspective, embracing a more integrative framework that considers interactions amongst all elements of the neurovascular unit. Such a holistic approach will enhance our understanding of how tDCS exerts its effects, thereby improving its clinical utility.",

    "content": "IntroductionThis report deals with advanced processing of blood oxygenation-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. It does not address functional characteristics of the human cortex, such as functional connectivity. fMRI is based on measurement of BOLD variations of transverse relaxation time T2* or T2. T2* or T2 can be calculated when multiple echoes of the MRI signal are recorded and may be more resistant to artifacts or better characterize tissue properties than the echoes themselves.ObjectivesTo develop a robust-to-noise algorithm for dynamic T2* mapping from a three gradient-echo (GRE) signal, allowing exploration of the potential of quantitative T2* mapping.MethodsfMRI resting-state and block-design visual task three-echo data were acquired from nine healthy volunteers. A significant problem in multi-echo T2* fitting is the noise in the echoes. The majority of BOLD-denoising methods first pinpoint some source of noise and subsequently remove the respective noise time series. We instead first postulated that the blood oxygenation changes smoothly and consequently developed a state-of-the-art denoising algorithm that minimizes total variation (TV), enforcing smoothness in the processed BOLD echoes while preserving local temporal signal means. To ensure that calculated T2* time courses are also smooth, they were estimated from TV-denoised echoes. We used a denoising approach initially proposed by Professor Stanley Osher for two-dimensional (2D) images that has been very successful, most prominently in space research, where it enabled the reconstruction of the first-ever image of a black hole. To our knowledge, Osher\u2019s approach has so far not been used elsewhere for the denoising of one-dimensional fMRI time series.ResultsSignal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise distributions of the denoised echoes, as well as of the T2* time series, were superior to those obtained by the current fMRI denoising methods (3dDespike, tedana, NORDIC). The denoised echoes and the T2* time courses match the shape of the theoretical hemodynamic function much better than previous results.ConclusionThe TV-minimizing fMRI time series denoising algorithm yields denoised echoes of unprecedented quality, enabling estimation of smooth, dynamic T2* maps, i.e., a transition from qualitative-only fMRI echoes to fMRI signals endowed with time units.",

What is less known is how music expertise affects the brain\u2019s functional connectivity during music listening.MethodsA novel algorithm, Leading Eigenvector Dynamic Analysis, was used to extract the specific dynamic patterns and the corresponding transition process during a naturalistic free-listening paradigm between 18 musicians and 18 non-musicians.ResultsWe found a brain state involving the frontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortex, associated with higher cognitive functions, emotional regulation, and reward, to be more recurrent in musicians during music listening compared to non-musicians. Transition processes revealed heightened engagement in areas linked to auditory processing, somatosensory integration, cognitive function, and emotional regulation in musicians. This enhanced dynamic connectivity might be linked to musicians\u2019 ability to integrate complex auditory stimuli and derive emotional meaning from them. Non-musicians, conversely, showed a tendency to engage more with the default mode network during music listening, possibly in relation to self-relevant mental processes and connection with personal experiences while being absorbed with the music.DiscussionThese findings highlight how music expertise shapes functional connectivity dynamics, musicians enhancing sensorimotor-cognitive integration and non-musicians relying on emotion and personal engagement.",

Because of the differences in brain microstructure and resting-state connections between different sleep chronotype, it may lead to differences in individual cognitive function. Concurrently, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between perioperative circadian misalignment and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), as well as targeted therapeutic strategies, have garnered increasing attention in recent research. Chronotype exerts regulatory effects on cognitive function via circadian rhythm modulation, neuroinflammatory cascades, and metabolic homeostasis. Perioperative alterations in sleep architecture\u2014including diminished slow-wave sleep (SWS) and circadian desynchronization\u2014may potentiate cognitive deficits and exacerbating neuroinflammation-mediated neuronal apoptosis. This review mainly focuses on the relationship between sleep chronotype and cognitive function as well as perioperative sleep chronotype changes, providing the latest evidence of relevant studies of domestic and foreign. In addition, different sleep patterns and postoperative cognitive dysfunction are prospected, which provides a new direction for exploring the different mechanisms of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in the future.",

    "content": "The expanding scale and complexity of functional brain image datasets require space-time analytics. Spacetime concordance (STC) meets this need through an adaptive and robust framework optimized for high-speed analysis. At the core of STC, the Regional Functional Affinity (RFA) metric quantifies functional diversity and uniformity in primate connectomes using wakeful fMRI. This data-driven optimization achieves considerably faster processing, becoming broadly relevant to comparative neuroscience applications. We validated this approach using large-scale datasets from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 1,003) and the NIH Marmoset Brain Mapping Project (N = 26). Results demonstrate striking correspondence between parcellation boundaries of HCP atlas and functional heterogeneity, with boundary lines consistently aligning with regions of low RFA values. In humans, higher-order association networks exhibited lower RFA values indicating functional diversity, while primary sensorimotor networks displayed higher RFA values reflecting uniformity. Cross-species analysis revealed evolutionary conservation of this organizational principle alongside species-specific adaptations. The RFA metric successfully bridges discrete parcellation schemes and continuous models of brain function, offering new insights into primate brain organization and evolution.",

    "title": "Beyond the straight path: high-density laminar recordings in the ventral hippocampus with curved microprobes",
    "content": "Brain function is governed by neural circuits distributed across an intricate, three-dimensional landscape of anatomically complex structures. Current methods for monitoring neural activity are limited to investigating structures that lie along a single, linear trajectory. While this approach is effective for columnar regions, such as dorsal cortical areas or the relatively planar dorsal hippocampus, it fails in deep or curved structures, like the ventral hippocampus, where a linear probe can only achieve with difficulty the combination of physical access and perpendicular orientation required for recordings across all layers. To overcome this limitation, we developed a multisite microelectrode array with a pre-formed curved geometry, engineered to align perpendicularly with neuronal layers in deep anatomical targets regardless of their orientation. This interface integrates a polymer-based array, featuring 16 PEDOT:BF4-coated microelectrodes for robust signal acquisition, with a dissolvable silk stiffener for precise surgical insertion. The resulting device exhibited excellent electrical properties (avg. impedance 18 k{Omega}) and enabled accurate placement across the distinct neuronal layers of the ventral hippocampus CA1 region. These capabilities allowed for successful recordings of both local field potentials and single-unit activity from this region, providing a powerful new tool to investigate the network dynamics of previously inaccessible neural circuits.",

    "title": "Flexible gaze reinstatement during working memory for natural scenes",
    "content": "Working memory (WM) representations may be more action-oriented and anatomically widespread than previously assumed. For instance, oculomotor signatures like gaze biases can reflect spatial WM content. However, the specificity and functional relevance of such signatures is unclear. Here, we tracked eye gaze during WM for naturalistic images, and manipulated which image features were most task-relevant (visual or semantic). In two experiments, we found that the eyes carried out item-specific spatiotemporal gaze sequences during WM maintenance, retracing the scanpath from stimulus encoding. Therefore, gaze patterns during WM track the identity of complex, natural images held in mind. Moreover, the degree of such WM gaze reinstatement was stronger when the task prioritized visual detail, and ramped up in anticipation of the test probe. Oculomotor WM signals are therefore malleable to when and how the content will be used, indicating that distributed WM representations are prospectively-oriented and functionally flexible to situational needs.",

    "content": "IntroductionIdentification and treatment of neurological disorders depend much on brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision support. Although they are loud, do not remain in one spot, and are rather complex, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are the principal tool used in research of brain function. This work employs an Adaptive Transformer-based technique with improved attention processes to extract temporal and spatial relationships in EEG data, effectively addressing these issues.MethodsFirst processed to eliminate noise and split them into time-series chunks, EEG data are then included into the proposed approach. Channel-wise embeddings and temporal encoding help to depict the data. Then, a transformer design including spatial attention for inter-channel interactions, multi-head self-attention for temporal aspects, and an adaptive attention mask for domain-specific modifications is used. Other openly accessible EEG datasets as well as the TUH EEG Corpus and CHB-MIT were evaluated against the model. Its performance was scored using metrics like accuracy, precision, memory, and F1-score.ResultsThe suggested method was more accurate than standard models like CNNs and LSTMs, with a score of 98.24%. The method was also shown to be able to find minor patterns in EEG data by improving precision and memory. Attention maps showed important areas of time and space, which made them easier to understand and useful in professional settings.DiscussionThe Adaptive Transformer turns out to be a useful tool for neurotherapeutic use of EEG data modeling. The approach provides greater medical assistance and knowledge on the functioning of the brain as well as answers significant issues. Future research might focus on subject-specific modifications and interaction with real-time systems.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models in revolutionizing EEG analysis for precision brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision-making.",

    "title": "Field usability and validity of eye-tracking instrumentation with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test among children aged 2\u20134 years old in Northern Coastal Ecuador.",
    "content": "Objective: There is a need for effective cognitive assessment tools to evaluate the development of very young children in resource-limited low- and middle-income country settings. Our objective was to evaluate the field usability of a computer-based attention test and its concurrent validity with a caregiver-reported screener of neurodevelopment in rural, Ecuadorian children. Method: To assess a computer-based attention test in a resource-limited setting, 41 Ecuadorian children between 2 and 4 years of age were evaluated once with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention adapted to eye-tracking instrumentation. To evaluate the validity of the ECVT, results were compared with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133, measured 3\u20134 times between 21 and 48 months of age. Results: ECVT measures were collected successfully for 97.6% of children (40/41), suggesting good field usability of the test in this resource-limited setting. An increase in 1 SD in child attention, as measured by the ECVT average fixation duration, was associated with a 7.9-point increase in the overall Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133 score (95% CI [1.5, 14.2], <em>p</em> = .015). Conclusions: A computer-based attention assessment in early childhood was usable in a resource-limited setting and predictive of a caregiver-reported screener of child neurodevelopment. The ECVT, therefore, can be used to assess the effects of early risk factors and resilience in brain/behavior development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index \u201cspeed\u201d potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. Method: The present study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children aged 8\u201312 with and without ADHD (<em>N</em> = 119). Results: There was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the <em>tau</em> parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD and among children with low working memory capacity (regardless of ADHD status). Variance in <em>tau</em> was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of adopting analytic methods that can more accurately describe performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here, we determine whether familiarizing individuals with self-appraisal with daily memory testing for 7 days provide a more accurate estimate of cognitive functioning and mood. Method: Two hundred twenty-five participants (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> \u00b1 <em>SD</em>: 74.1 \u00b1 8.3 years; 66% female; median education 16.0 years) completed the online Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health, which included two associative memory tasks, for seven consecutive days. Each day, participants self-appraised their performance. At baseline, they completed various cognitive and mood measures. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between task performance and self-appraisal on Days 1 and 7 and used linear models to examine the relationship between self-appraisal scores and clinical measures. Results: Accuracy (Day 1: 0.44 \u00b1 0.12; Day 7: 0.81 \u00b1 0.16) and self-appraisal (Day 1: 0.36 \u00b1 0.15; Day 7: 0.70 \u00b1 0.21) increased, as did the association between accuracy and self-appraisal, Day 1: correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [0.09, 0.34], <em>p</em> = .001; Day 7: <em>r</em> = 0.69, 95% CI [0.62, 0.76], <em>p</em> < .001. Self-appraisal scores on Day 7, but not Day 1, showed significant relationships with in-clinic measures. Conclusions: Repeated remote cognitive assessments may help elucidate individuals\u2019 capacities to refine their self-perception of cognitive performance during multiday learning. The weak association between accuracy and test-na\u00efve self-appraisal warrants caution about using this metric cross-sectionally. Experienced self-appraisal could be especially relevant at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when subtle learning difficulties emerge and could improve our capacity to detect early meta-cognitive changes.

    "title": "py-capnweb - A Python implementation of Cap'n Web's RPC protocol",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've just released v0.3.0 of a project I've been working on called <strong>py-capnweb</strong>.</p> <p>It's a Python implementation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb\">Cap'n Web protocol</a>, a fascinating new RPC protocol announced a couple of weeks ago. My implementation is <strong>fully interoperable</strong> with the official TypeScript version, so you can have a Python backend talking to a TypeScript/JS frontend (and vice-versa) seamlessly.</p> <h1>What The Project Does</h1> <p><code>py-capnweb</code> is designed to eliminate the friction of client-server communication. It makes remote function calls feel just like local function calls. Instead of manually writing HTTP endpoints, serializing data, and dealing with network waterfalls, you can design your APIs like you would a normal JavaScript or Python library.</p> <p>Two main features stand out: <strong>capability-based security</strong> and <strong>promise pipelining</strong>. This means you pass around secure object references instead of raw data, and you can chain multiple dependent calls into a single network round trip, which can be a huge performance win.</p> <h1>Target Audience &amp; Production Readiness</h1> <p>This project is for developers building interactive, cross-language applications (e.g., Python backend, JS/TS frontend) who are tired of the boilerplate and latency issues that come with traditional REST or even GraphQL APIs.</p> <p><strong>Is it production-ready?</strong> The protocol itself is new but built on the mature foundations of Cap'n Proto. My implementation is at <code>v0.3.0</code> and passes a comprehensive cross-implementation test suite. It's stable and ready for real-world use cases, especially for teams that want to be on the cutting edge of RPC technology.</p> <h1>How is it Different from REST, gRPC, or GraphQL?</h1> <p>This is the most important question! Here\u2019s a quick comparison:</p> <ul> <li><strong>vs. REST:</strong> REST is resource-oriented, using a fixed set of verbs (GET, POST, etc.). Cap'n Web is object-oriented, allowing you to call methods on remote objects directly. This avoids the &quot;N+1&quot; problem and complex state management on the client, thanks to promise pipelining.</li> <li><strong>vs. gRPC:</strong> gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework, but it's schema-based (using Protocol Buffers). Cap'n Web is schema-less, making it more flexible and feel more native to dynamic languages like Python and JavaScript, which means less boilerplate. While gRPC has streaming, Cap'n Web's promise pipelining and bidirectional nature provide a more expressive way to handle complex, stateful interactions.</li> <li><strong>vs. GraphQL:</strong> GraphQL is excellent for querying complex data graphs in one go. However, it's a specialized query language and can be awkward for mutations or chained operations. Cap'n Web solves the same &quot;over-fetching&quot; problem as GraphQL but feels like writing regular code, not a query. You can intuitively chain calls (<code>user.getProfile()</code>, <code>profile.getFriends()</code>, etc.) in a single, efficient batch.</li> </ul> <h1>Key Features of py-capnweb</h1> <ul> <li><strong>100% TypeScript Interoperability</strong>: Fully tested against the official <code>capnweb</code> library.</li> <li><strong>Promise Pipelining</strong>: Batch dependent calls into a single network request to slash latency.</li> <li><strong>Capability-Based Security</strong>: Pass around secure object references, not exposed data.</li> <li><strong>Bidirectional RPC</strong>: It's peer-to-peer; the &quot;server&quot; can call the &quot;client&quot; just as easily.</li> <li><strong>Pluggable Transports</strong>: Supports HTTP batch and WebSocket out-of-the-box. (More planned!)</li> <li><strong>Fully Async</strong>: Built on Python's <code>asyncio</code>.</li> <li><strong>Type-Safe</strong>: Complete type hints (tested with <code>pyrefly</code>/<code>mypy</code>).</li> </ul> <h1>See it in Action</h1> <p>Here\u2019s how simple it is to get started.</p> <p><strong>(Server,</strong> <code>server.py</code>**)**</p> <pre><code>import asyncio from typing import Any from capnweb.server import Server, ServerConfig from capnweb.types import RpcTarget from capnweb.error import RpcError class Calculator(RpcTarget): async def call(self, method: str, args: list[Any]) -&gt; Any: match method: case &quot;add&quot;: return args[0] + args[1] case &quot;subtract&quot;: return args[0] - args[1] case _: raise RpcError.not_found(f&quot;Method {method} not found&quot;) async def main() -&gt; None: config = ServerConfig(host=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, port=8080) server = Server(config) server.register_capability(0, Calculator()) # Register main capability await server.start() print(&quot;Calculator server listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080/rpc/batch&quot;) await asyncio.Event().wait() if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: asyncio.run(main()) </code></pre> <p><strong>(Client,</strong> <code>client.py</code>**)**</p> <pre><code>import asyncio from capnweb.client import Client, ClientConfig async def main() -&gt; None: config = ClientConfig(url=&quot;http://localhost:8080/rpc/batch&quot;) async with Client(config) as client: result = await client.call(0, &quot;add&quot;, [5, 3]) print(f&quot;5 + 3 = {result}&quot;) # Output: 5 + 3 = 8 result = await client.call(0, &quot;subtract&quot;, [10, 4]) print(f&quot;10 - 4 = {result}&quot;) # Output: 10 - 4 = 6 if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: asyncio.run(main()) </code></pre> <h1>Check it out!</h1> <p>I'd love for you to take a look, try it out, and let me know what you think. I believe this paradigm can genuinely improve how we build robust, cross-language distributed systems.</p> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub Repo</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/abilian/py-capnweb\">https://github.com/abilian/py-capnweb</a></li> <li><strong>Installation</strong>: <code>pip install capnweb</code> or <code>uv add capnweb</code></li> </ul> <p>The project is dual-licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0. All feedback, issues, and contributions are welcome!</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a Python version of the new Cap'n Web RPC protocol that's 100% compatible with the official TypeScript version. It's built on <code>asyncio</code>, is schema-less, and uses promise pipelining to make distributed programming feel more like local development.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sfermigier\"> /u/sfermigier </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv5lcw/pycapnweb_a_python_implementation_of_capn_webs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv5lcw/pycapnweb_a_python_implementation_of_capn_webs/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign.

To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One very obvious way to see that I never thought Type M and Type S errors \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis'\" is that, since the appearance of that article in 2014, I've published dozens of applied papers, and in only very few of these did I look at Type M and Type S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

    "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
    "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

Fmr1-KO male mice and wild-type (WT) were evaluated in the open field, marble-burying, elevated-plus-maze (EPM), novel-object-recognition (NOR) and three-chamber sociability test (3-CST); acetylated \u03b1-tubulin (Acet/Total-Tub) and tyrosinated/detyrosinated \u03b1-tubulin (Tyr/Glu-Tub) ratios were then analyzed. Fmr1-KO male showed hyperactivity, excessive marble burying and impaired NOR; Acet/Total-Tub was elevated and Tyr/Glu-Tub reduced vs. WT, indicating reduced microtubule dynamics. In a mixed-sex cohort bred female WT displayed lower Acet/Total-Tub and increased Tyr/Glu-Tub vs. male WT. The Fmr1-KO-associated decrease in Tyr/Glu-Tub was consistent across sexes. FMRP and synaptic markers were also analyzed in this cohort, spinophilin was found increased in both male and female Fmr1-KO. Fmr1-heterozygous females showed no molecular alterations, supporting the protective role of FMRP. Fmr1-KO male mice received vehicle or GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors and were tested in behavioral assays followed by \u03b1-tubulin PTMs analysis. Daily vehicle injections appeared to abolish baseline differences in hyperactivity, marble burying and \u03b1-tubulin PTMs. Under these conditions both inhibitors reduced marble burying. SB216763 normalized social discrimination in 3-CST, while AF3581 only produced a non-significant positive trend. Neither compound altered \u03b1-tubulin PTMs. These results show that GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition has anti-perseverative and pro-social effects in Fmr1-KO male mice. However, behavioral and molecular endpoints, such as \u03b1-tubulin PTMs, appear to be sensitive to both genetic background and experimental procedures.",

    "title": "Human in vivo assessment of ketamine binding of the serotonin transporter\u2014follow up at a higher dose",
    "content": "Ketamine is a rapid-acting antidepressant approved in the indication of treatment-resistant depression. As its clinical use expands, identifying underlying molecular mechanisms is essential. The serotonin transporter (SERT) is well known as a primary mechanism of several classes of monoaminergic antidepressants. Binding of ketamine to SERT has been observed in vitro and in animal studies with macaque monkeys using positron emission tomography (PET). We previously reported that a 0.5\u202fmg/kg body weight dose of ketamine did not significantly bind to SERT in healthy human subjects assessed with PET but observed a positive trend between binding and ketamine plasma levels. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that a higher dose (0.8\u202fmg/kg) would result in measurable SERT occupancy. Here, 10 healthy male participants were measured twice with [11C]DASB PET to test SERT occupancy following administration of 0.8\u202fmg/kg body weight ketamine in four selected SERT rich regions amygdala, putamen, caudate and thalamus. Further, we implemented a bolus-plus-infusion radioligand infusion protocol and optimized the timing of the ketamine infusion. Contrary to our hypothesis, ketamine SERT occupancy did not significantly differ from zero, and the area under the curve of ketamine and norketamine plasma levels was not correlated with occupancy. These results suggest that even at doses up to 0.8\u202fmg/kg, ketamine does not appreciably bind to SERT in humans, aligning with clinical observations that ketamine is routinely combined with serotonergic agents.Clinical trial registrationhttp://clinicaltrials.gov, identifier, NCT02582398.

    "title": "Street dancing enhances cognitive reserve in young females: an fNIRS study",
    "content": "IntroductionWith the accelerating aging population, cognitive decline and dementia pose major public health challenges. Early intervention is crucial for mitigating these risks. Dance, with its high cognitive demands and multitasking coordination, has shown benefits for cognitive function. However, evidence on the effects of street dance on prefrontal cortex activation and executive function is limited. This study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore how street dance impacts prefrontal activation and executive function, offering insights into early prevention of cognitive decline.MethodsA total of 28 healthy female college students were recruited and randomly assigned to a street dance intervention group (n\u202f=\u202f14) or a control group (n\u202f=\u202f14). The study was conducted between March and September 2024 at a university in Southwest China. The intervention group participated in an 18-week street dance program, three times per week, with each session lasting 80\u202fmin. The control group maintained their usual routines without structured physical activity. fNIRS was used pre- and post-intervention to assess changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO\u2082) levels in the prefrontal cortex during the 2-back, Stroop, and More-Odd Shifting tasks.ResultsTwo-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant Group \u00d7 Time interaction effects in multiple prefrontal regions across the three tasks. In the 2-back task, the street dance group showed significant increases in HbO\u2082 in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, accompanied by improvements in accuracy and faster reaction times. In the Stroop task, HbO\u2082 significantly increased in the right frontopolar and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, reflecting enhanced inhibitory control. In the More-Odd Shifting task, significant activation was observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus, together with improved task-switching accuracy and reduced reaction times.ConclusionThe 18-week street dance intervention effectively improved working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, contributing to enhanced cognitive reserve. As a physical activity combining rhythm and coordination, street dance offers a promising early intervention strategy for delaying cognitive decline and reducing dementia risk.Clinical trial registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/, identifier ChiCTR2400083689.",

    "content": "The development of highly sensitive, wide linear-range flexible pressure sensors is crucial for practical applications in human-computer interaction, physiological signal detection, and motion monitoring. However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning...",
